Concubinage between such persons they looked on as a kind of marriage, and even allowed it several privileges; but then this concubinage was confined to a single person, and was of perpetual obligation as much as marriage itself. Hottoman observes, that the Roman laws had allowed of concubinage <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before Julius Caesar made that law whereby every one was allowed to marry as many wives as he pleased. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VALENTINIAN\">Valentinian</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a> tell us, allowed every man two.\n\nCONCUBINAGE is also used for a marriage performed with less solemnity than the formal marriage: or a marriage\nmarriage with a woman of inferior condition, and to whom the husband does not convey his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. Cujas observes, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> laws allowed a man to espouse, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of concubine, certain persons, such as were esteemed unequal to him, on account of the want of some qualities requisite to sustain the full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of marriage. He adds, that though concubinage was beneath marriage, both as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> and civil effects; yet was concubinage a reputable title, very different from that of mistresses among us. The commerce was esteemed so lawful, that the concubine might be accused of adultery in the same manner as a wife.\n\nThis kind of concubinage is still in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in some countries, particularly in Germany, under the title of a half-marriage, morgengabe marriage or marriage with the left-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>; alluding to the manner of its being contracted, viz. by the man's giving the woman his left hand instead of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>.

They were deemed to retain the low rank of the mother; and were on this ground unqualified for inheriting the effects of the father.\n\nConcubinage, in a legal sense, is used as an exception against her that sueth for dower, alleging thereby, that she was not a wife lawfully married to the party, in whose lands she seeks to be endowed, but his concubine.","sp":99,"ep":100},{"h":"CONCUBINE","t":"a woman whom a person takes to cohabit with him, in the manner, and under the character, of a wife, without being authorized thereto by a legal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>.\n\nConcubine is also used for a real, legitimate, and only wife, distinguished by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other circumstance but a disparity of birth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> condition between her and the husband. Du Cange observes, that one may gather from several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> in the epistles of the popes, that they anciently allowed of such concubines.

His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> inclination, however, lay towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> art; and at the age of 18 he obtained permission to make his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> as a volunteer in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> commanded by M. de la Meilleraye. This campaign was unfortunate; and the duke d'Enguien was only a witness of the marshal's imprudence and disgrace. Nevertheless, in this campaign he laid the foundation of that renown which made him afterwards considered as the greatest general of his age.\n\nOn his return to Paris, the duke waited upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Richelieu at Rueil. That minister was so pleased with his conversation, that he soon after made proposals of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with the prince of Conde, by marrying the duke d'Enguien to Claire Clemence de Maille Breza, the cardinal's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIECE\">niece</a>. The duke consented to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> out of obedience to his father; but the force he put upon himself by yielding to it was so great, that he fell dangerously ill. It was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before he got the better of his distemper; but at length he not only recovered, but became so strong as afterwards to bear the greatest fatigues with ease.\n\nThe duke made two more campaigns as a volunteer; the one under the marshal de la Meilleraye, the other in the army of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIII. which conquered Roussillon. In 1643, at the age of 22, he obtained from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, at the persuasion of Cardinal Mazarin, the command of the army destined to cover Champagne and Picardy; which command was confirmed to him after the king's death by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> regent, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a>, to whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> he was strongly devoted. In this station, though he never had been present at any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, he soon gave such a specimen of his abilities as crowned him with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>. The Spaniards, who threatened France with an invasion, were defeated by him at Rocroi; and this signal victory made him from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> considered as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">guardian</a> genius of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. He next formed the project of besieging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THIONVILLE\">Thionville</a>, and proposed it to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of regency. They consented with fear and distrust; but the duke carried it into execution with such skill, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>, and courage, that he became justly the subject of general admiration. In two months time Thionville surrendered. At length, having covered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALSACE\">Alsace</a> and Lorraine from the enterprises of the Imperialists, the duke returned to Paris, where he obtained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of Champagne, and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Stenai.\n\nThe three following years were little more than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of military operations. The three battles of Fribourg, in which the duke d'Enguien triumphed over Velt Marshal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> de Mercy, the greatest general in all Germany; the taking of Philippsbourg, and a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of other places, which rendered him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALATINATE\">palatinate</a>, and of the whole course of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a>; the victory of Norlingue, by which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> the vicount du Turenne's defeat at Mariendal; the siege and conquest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUNKIRK\">Dunkirk</a>, the good and bad success of his arms in Catalonia, where, though he was forced to raise the siege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LERIDA\">Lerida</a>, he kept the Spaniards in awe, and cut to pieces their rear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a>; these are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> events which distinguished the campaigns of 1644, 1645, and 1646.\n\nThe victories of the duke d'Enguien, his great reputation and esteem with the people, began now to give umbrage to Mazarin. The cardinal's dislike to him appeared on the death of the duke de Breze, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a> of France. The prince of Conde earnestly demanded for his son the duke de Breze's places. But Mazarin, afraid of increasing the wealth and power of a prince whom his victories and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> and confidence of the people and the army had already rendered too formidable to him, evaded his request, by persuading the queen to take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRALTY\">admiralty</a> to herself. On the death of his father, the minister's dislike to the young prince of Conde became still more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>. By the minister's persuasion he had accepted of the command of the army in Catalonia; but, on his arrival at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARCELONA\">Barcelona</a>, he found neither troops, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, nor ammunition. Enraged at this deception, he vented his resentment in bitter complaints and severe threats; but by the resources that he found in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILEMMA\">dilemma</a>, the prince added new lustre to his glory.\n\nThe campaign of 1648 was as glorious to Conde as those which preceded it had been. To disconcert at once the projects of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a>-duke Leopold, the prince resolved to attack him even in the heart of the Low Countries; and notwithstanding the considerable difficulties which he had to surmount, he besieged the important city of Ypres, and took it in sight of all the enemy's forces.\n\nNotwithstanding this success, Conde <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> himself at the point of experiencing the greatest reverse of fortune. His army was a prey to scarcity, to nakedness, contagious distempers, and desertion. For eight months it received <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> supply from the minister, but half a muleter. Every thing was supplied by the prince himself; he lavished his money, and borrowed more to supply his troops. When it was represented to him that he was in danger of ruining himself by such an enormous expense, he replied, that \"since he every day ventured his life for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of his country, he could very well sacrifice his fortune to it. Let but the government exist (added he), and I shall want for nothing.\"\n\nThe French army having been reinforced by 4000 of the troops of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WEIMAR\">Weimar</a>, Conde attacked the Spaniards advantageously encamped near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENS\">Lens</a>, and gained a complete victory over them, which disabled them from attempting anything more, and even from supporting themselves. Afterwards he besieged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FURNES\">Furnes</a>, the garrison of which, 900 men, surrendered themselves prisoners of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>. But the prince was wounded there in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENCHES\">trenches</a> by a musket-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> hip; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTUSION\">contusion</a> was so great, that he was forced to submit to several incisions.\n\nThe French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, animated with the victory at Lens, thought this a proper time to take vengeance\non the factions which for some time had violently agitated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>; and accordingly imprisoned Broussel and Blanckenil, two of the principal leaders of the country party. This vigorous proceeding, however, occasioned a general revolt. Two hundred thousand men took arms in Paris, barricaded the streets, invested the palais-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a>, and demanded the prisoners. It was necessary to release them; but from that time the regal authority was annihilated; the queen was exposed to a thousand insults, and Mazarin dared no longer venture out of the palais-royal. In this embarrassment the queen recalled the prince of Conde, as the only one from whom she could hope for support. He retired to Rueil, whither the regent had gone with the young king and Mazarin. Anne of Austria proposed to him the reducing of Paris by force of arms; but he calmed the resentments of that princess; and instead of being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCESSORY\">accessory</a> to her vengeance, he directed all his views to pacify the kingdom, and at length brought about an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> between the parties, who desired it with equal ardour. But new incidents soon rekindled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a>. The treachery of Mazarin, and the artifices of the leaders of the country party, occasioned new cabals and fresh troubles. Conde was caressed by the leaders of both parties; but at last, enraged at the arrogance of the malecontents, who every day formed new pretensions, he took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> openly with the court, though he thought it ungrateful, and protected the minister, though he did not esteem him.\n\nThe royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a>, Conde, and Mazarin, left Paris privately in the night between the 5th and 6th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1646, and went to St Germain. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> sent deputies to learn from the queen herself the reasons of her departure, and to beg her to name the citizens whom she suspected, that they might be tried. Mazarin had the imprudence to dismiss them without any answer. Exasperated at this, the people again took up arms in order to defend themselves against the enterprises of the court, who had determined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> up and to starve the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, in order to suppress the party of malecontents. With 7 or 8000 men, the broken relics of the last campaign, the prince of Conde formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of reducing above 500,000 entrenched behind walls. He had neither money nor magazines; he saw himself in the depth of a most severe winter; nevertheless he triumphed over Paris, and this great success completed his glory. It did him so much the more honour, as during the siege he constantly defeated the troops of the malecontents; he prevailed on the army that marched to their assistance under Turenne, to abandon that general; he flopped the progress of the duke de Longueville, who had caused an insurrection in Normandy; and got the start of the Spaniards, who were advancing to give him battle.\n\nCondi de Retz, coadjutor of Paris, and afterwards cardinal, was the life and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> of the revolters, and directed all their motions. He had taken Catiline for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a>; and was equally intrepid and capable of the greatest actions; of an exalted genius, but governed by his ambition. He distinguished his hatred to Mazarin by arming the malecontents; and he himself raised at his own expense a regiment which he called the regiment of Corinth; as soon as this corps took the field during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCKADE\">blockade</a> of Paris, it was defeated and dispersed. This check was called the first to the Corinthians. The peace was signed at St Germain; but neither party carried its point, and scarce anyone but Conde acquired glory by this war. After the conclusion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a>, the prince repaired to the capital, and traversed all the streets in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COACH\">coach</a> alone. All persons of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> paid their compliments to him, and the parliament sent a solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPUTATION\">deputation</a> to thank him for the peace to which he had so powerfully contributed. The people, however, made loud complaints on account of the king's absence (for the court was not yet returned to Paris), and the malecontents gave reason to apprehend a new insurrection. Conde encouraged the king and queen to return; and at length brought them to Paris, amidst the acclamations and blessings of the public.\n\nThe important service which Conde had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> done the court entitled him to the acknowledgments of the queen, and especially of Mazarin; but the dark soul of that cardinal only remembered it to punish a too fortunate and too powerful protector. He privately swore the prince's destruction; at least that he should give the whole kingdom a pattern of submission and dependence on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>. However, not to excite the public indignation, he still kept up appearances with the prince, while he secretly spread about him distrusts, suspicions, snares of every kind, and the most heinous calumnies. The ungrateful minister deceived the prince by making him the most flattering proposals; and with the most alluring promises which he always found means to avoid fulfilling. The enraged prince despised the minister, and treated him with disdain. After this they were reconciled again only to be again at variance. Each of them in their turn courted the country party, in order to make it subservient to their designs. At last Mazarin thought of an expedient, which but too effectually answered his purpose, of making an irreconcilable quarrel between that party and the prince. Among the malecontents the marquis de la Boulai\u00e9, a man of an infamous character, had obtained the confidence of the party by false appearances of hatred to the cardinal, but secretly kept up a correspondence with him. It is pretended that he made him an offer of privately killing Conde. Mazarin was charmed with the proposal; yet he only required Boulai\u00e9 to exhibit all the proofs of an afflatusion, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in such a manner that everything might concur to render the country party suspected of that crime. He was punctually obeyed; the coach was stopped; some pistols were fired at it; by which two of the footmen were dangerously wounded; and, after that shameful exploit, la Boulai\u00e9 took refuge in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOTEL\">hotel</a> of the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUFORT\">Beaufort</a>, who was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> of the party, in order no doubt to countenance the prince's suspicion of the malecontents. Luckily Conde was not in his coach when it was stopped; the cardinal had spread the report of his intended afflatusion; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> with the queen and the prince he had prevailed to have the coach sent away empty, to prove the reality of the attempt. Mazarin counterfeited a zeal for the prince's life; he furiously declaimed against the malecontents, who, he pretended, had made an attempt on a life so precious to the state; and he inflamed Conde's resentment against the duke of Beaufort.\nConde. Beaufert and the coadjutor, whom he supposed to be the authors of this heinous outrage. The prince was so strongly prejudiced, that he refused to hear them when they appeared before him to justify themselves. He demanded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> against them of the king; he formally accused them before the parliament, and remained inflexible in spite of the pains which the leaders of the party took to demonstrate to him that he had been imposed upon. However, the affair was brought before the parliament; the accused defended themselves, and the coadjutor, who had discovered the cardinal's secret, unmasked him to well, that the prince agreed to a private negociation with the malecontents; he required nothing more than the coadjutor's leaving Paris, but with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> to Rome or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>. That prelate would have consented to it, to satisfy Conde, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> Mazarin, some days after, had not given him the choice of any recompense, in order to engage his concurrence in the prince's destruction. Affairs were now in such a dangerous situation, that the cardinal saw clearly it was necessary to hasten to the winding up of the plot. Master of the queen's mind, which he guided as he pleased; and sure of having inflamed against Conde all the resentment of the malecontents; he fought and obtained, by means of the duchess Chevreuse, the support of that powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a>, which connected itself the more readily with him, in hopes that the prince's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> would soon enable it to crush without difficulty the cardinal himself. The coadjutor had private conferences with the queen and the minister. Conde had notice of it; and in order to discover if it were true, he endeavoured to surmise it from Mazarin's own mouth. \"Cardinal (said he, one day), it is publicly reported that you have nightly meetings with the coadjutor, disguised like a trooper.\" He accompanied this speech with a quick and penetrating look: but the cardinal, who was a perfect master of dissimulation, answered him in such a free, artless-like manner, that he entirely removed Conde's apprehensions; and he slighted the information he had received, of the plot forming against him.\n\nMazarin wanted nothing but the support of the duke of Orleans; and at last found means, by the duchess Chevreuse, to inflame the jealousy of that fickle and inconstant prince, and to engage him to consent to the imprisonment of Conde. Having thus united all parties, and fearing no other obstacle, this ungrateful and pernicious minister made preparations for privately arresting the prince: the order for it was signed January 18th 1650. Conde having that day repaired as usual to the palais-royal, to assist at council with the prince of Conti and the duke of Longueville, the queen gave orders to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARREST\">arrest</a> them all three, and convey them without any noise to the castle of Vincennes. She was instantly obeyed, and the princes were strictly guarded in that prison.\n\nIn this unexpected reverse of fortune, the fortitude and greatness of Conde's mind appeared only the more remarkable. Confined with the other two princes in the tower of Vincennes, where neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>, furniture, nor beds, were provided, he contented himself with two new laid eggs, and threw himself in his clothes, on a truss of straw, where he slept 12 hours without waking. He still retained his cheerfulness, and dedicated the greatest part of his time to reading, the rest to conversation, playing at battle-lover and shuttlecock, to bodily exercises, and the cultivation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>.\n\nMazarin triumphed at the disgrace of the princes, procribed all those who were attached to Conde, and behaved in the most insolent and arbitrary manner. The prince's friends, however, notwithstanding their being strictly watched, found means to keep up a punctual correspondence with him. They made various attempts to release him: they raised troops; in particular, the dukes of Bouillon and Rochefoucault, and the vicount de Turenne. The princes of Conde engaged the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Guienne to declare in his favour; he made war, in order to force the court to release him; at length the partizans of the prince signed a treaty with the Spaniards, to labour in concert for his enlargement. But all these efforts would, perhaps, have been ineffectual, if other more powerful resources had not been employed.\n\nIn that gallant and warlike age, every thing was managed by the passions and intrigues of five or six women, who possessed the confidence of the leaders of the state, and of the various parties. The princesses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANTUA\">Mantua</a>, wife to one of the sons of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELECTOR\">elector</a> Palatine, king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a>, principally directed the councils in the party of the princes. She found means to reconcile the duke of Orleans, the coadjutor, and the malecontents, with the friends of the prince, and united their efforts against the cardinal. The parliament, on the other side, loudly demanded the release of the prisoners. All the orders of the state united in soliciting it, inasmuch that the queen was at last prevailed on to give her consent. At this news, Mazarin was so confounded, that he fled in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> of a trooper, and arrived at the gates of Richlieu, where a body of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> waited for him. The parliament, informed by the queen of his flight, thundered forth an arr\u00eat, by which he was obliged to leave the kingdom, with his family and foreign servants, in the space of 15 days, under the penalty of being exposed to a criminal prosecution. The queen desired to follow him with the king; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a> and burghers invested the palais royal, and prevented the execution of this project, which would have kindled a civil war. Mazarin, therefore, perceiving that it was impossible for the queen to join him, determined to go himself to restore the princes to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, and to get the start of the deputies who were coming to acquaint them with it. On his arrival at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAVRE\">Havre</a>, he informed the princes that they were free; he entreated Conde's friendship; and was so abject as to prostrate himself at the feet of him whom he had so basely oppressed. Conde gave him a polite reception, and spoke to him in a free and cheerful tone; but tired with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> submissions which the cardinal lavished upon him, he left him without making any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a>, and set out on his return to Paris, which he entered as it were in triumph, amidst the acclamations of all orders of men, and the demonstrations of a most sincere and general joy.\n\nAfter this a civil war ensued, in which the prince of Conde sided with the malecontents. Being pressed by the king's army, he retired into the suburbs of St Anthony, where he behaved with the utmost bravery; when the citizens opened their gates and received\nreceived him in; and a peace ensued soon after. His hatred of the cardinal, however, made him quit Paris, and take refuge among the Spaniards, who made him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERALISSIMO\">generalissimo</a> of their forces; and he took Rocroi. The peace of the Pyrenees restored him to his country; and he again signalized himself at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the king's armies. Being afflicted with the gout, he refused the command of the army in 1676, and retired to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHANTILLY\">Chantilly</a>, where he was as much esteemed for the virtues of peace, as he had been before for his military talents. He died in 1686, at Fontainebleau.\n\nConde, a town of the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NETHERLANDS\">Netherlands</a>, in the province of Hainault, with the title of a principality, and a castle.

He received his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> of Navarre, where he was distinguished at an early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> for his strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of physics and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>. On his entrance into public life, he established a friendly intercourse with Voltaire, D'Alembert, and other literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, who professed opinions analogous to his own, and formed a very powerful party among the French literati, whose united efforts to propagate their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and politics, have been applauded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> condemned, according to the principles of their different judges. Condorcet first attracted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the public as a mathematician, obtaining their approbation for his treatise on integral calculations, which he composed at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 22. In the year 1767, his solution of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> of the Three Bodies made its appearance, and in the following year the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">Analysis</a>.\" In the year 1769 he was received a member of the Academy of Sciences, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> of which were greatly enriched by him with different papers on the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> branches of mathematical science. His justly merited reputation pointed him out as a fit person to cooperate with D'Alembert and Bossut, in afflicting M. Turgot, that celebrated minister and able financier, with arithmetical calculations. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he laboured indefatigably in the study of politics and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a>, and defended, in an anonymous publication, the feet of philosophers to which he had attached himself, from\nCondorcet, an attack made upon them in the Trois Siecles; and replied to M. Necker's essay on Corn Laws. He was appointed secretary to the Academy of Sciences in the year 1773, when he employed much of his time in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> eulogies on such of its deceased members as Fontenelle had passed over in silence. Like D'Alembert and some others, Condorcet having united in himself the characters of an elegant writer and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of profound research, was admitted into the French academy in 1783, when he pronounced an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORATION\">oration</a> on the influence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, which was ordered to be printed. From the time of D'Alembert's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, which happened this year, he filled the station of secretary to that academy, rendering his name conspicuous by the publication of eulogies on different eminent characters. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PANEGYRIC\">panegyric</a> on D'Alembert, to whom he was most sincerely attached, is a very elaborate performance, notwithstanding of which it is deemed by judges as a candid account of the genuine merits of that great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>. His encomium bestowed on that very able mathematician Euler, furnished him with a favourable opportunity of giving a circumstantial account of the specific improvements and inventions conferred on a peculiar branch of science by the labours of an individual; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> in a biographical writer which Condorcet appears to have possessed in an eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>. His eulogy on the minister Turgot was read with avidity, and admired by all those who approved of Turgot's plans of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> and system of finance. In the year 1787 he gave the public his \"Life of Voltaire,\" which was highly elaborate, and replete with lofty panegyric, on the merits of which mankind were consequently much divided, according to their sentiments of that author's philosophy. The last of his biographical works was an eulogy on the celebrated Dr Franklin, published in 1792, all of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be read with some degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> by those who are inimical to the school of philosophy to which he belonged.\n\nThe memorable event of the French revolution, which the writings of Condorcet and his associates unquestionably accelerated, naturally interested his feelings, and called forth his exertions. But the conduct of the political parties and their leaders, during this tumultuous period, is painted in colours so diametrically opposite to each other, that a proper estimate of it is scarcely possible. In this part of Condorcet's life, therefore, we must confine ourselves to such facts as are universally acknowledged, leaving it to our readers to draw inferences for themselves.\n\nAt an early period he employed his talents to promote those reforms, (for such they appeared in his judgment) which were to pave the way to a new order of things. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> entitled \"La Biblioth\u00e8que de l'Homme Public,\" to contain an analysis of the writings of the most eminent politicians, was chiefly conducted by him, as was also a newspaper called \"La Chronique de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>,\" filled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLAMATION\">declamation</a> against royalty. He had likewise a share in the \"Journal de Paris,\" a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> conducted on similar principles. About the time, when the unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> fled to Varennes he proposed a paper called \"Le R\u00e9publicain,\" the obvious intention of which is clearly deducible from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>. He was an indefatigable member of the Jacobin club, and spoke frequently, though not forcibly, in it. He was chosen a representative for Paris when Condorcet's constituent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> was dissolved, and followed the general political course of the Brissotine party. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> for public instruction was now to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> his abilities, which he finished in two elaborate memoirs, allowed to contain some exalted and enlarged ideas, but perhaps rather extensive to be reduced to practice. He was likewise author of the manifesto addressed to the European powers by the people of France, on the approach of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>. He wrote a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPOSTULATION\">expostulation</a> to the king while he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> of the assembly, which some have considered as by far too severe, and destitute of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> to which the sovereign is entitled. When the king was insulted by the populace at the Tuileries, in being offered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>, it is said that he vindicated their proceedings. We are also informed, that while he was degrading royalty in this manner, he was secretly soliciting the office of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> to the dauphin; a proposition which the king utterly rejected, on account of his avowed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDELITY\">infidelity</a>. Attempts have been made to fix upon his character the most abominable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INGRATITUDE\">ingratitude</a>, by making him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCESSORY\">accessory</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> de la Rochefoucault, to whom he was under the strongest obligations, and from whose family he had received a most accomplished wife with a fortune; but we sincerely hope that this calumny entirely originated from the malevolence of party spirit. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> of the king came to be agitated, Condorcet gave it as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that he could not be brought to judgment in a legal manner; yet it must be confessed that his conduct in regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>, was rather of an ambiguous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and betrayed that timidity and want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> which formed the most prominent features of his political <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>. The judgment of Madame Roland concerning the moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of this wonderful man has all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of impartiality. \"The genius of Condorcet,\" says that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>, \"is equal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a> of the greatest truths; but he has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other characteristic besides fear. It may be said of his understanding, combined with his person, that it is a fine essence absorbed in cotton. The timidity which forms the basis of his character, and which he displays even in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>, does not result from his frame alone, but seems to be inherent in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>, and his talents furnish him with no means of subduing it. Thus, after having deduced a principle or demonstrated a fact in the assembly, he would give a vote decidedly opposite, overawed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> of the tribunes, armed with insults, and lavished of menaces. The properest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> for him was the secretariatship of the academy. Such men should be employed to write, but never permitted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>.\" The Girondist party, after the execution of the king, employed him to frame a new constitution, the plan of which was presented to the convention, and obtained their approbation. It was not thus esteemed by the people at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>; and it has, perhaps not without reason, been considered as \"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of metaphysical absurdities.\" During the violent struggle between the Girondist and Mountain parties, Condorcet took no decided part with either, which seems to have been owing to the native timidity of his mind, and his abhorrence of the state of public affairs. He was not comprehended among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of those who were sacrificed with their leader Brissot; but having employed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> against the victorious party,\nCondorcet, he fell under the invincible displeasure of that inhuman, blood-thirsty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>, Robespierre, who issued a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a> against him in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>, 1793. He found means to effect his escape from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARREST\">arrest</a>, and during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> months concealed himself in Paris. Dreading at length that the tyrant would order a domiciliary visit for the purpose of discovering the place of his retreat, he passed through the barriers without being taken notice of, and went to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of a person in whom he could confide, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of Mont-Rouge, who unfortunately for Condorcet was at that time in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>. He was of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of passing two dreary nights in the open fields, a melancholy prey to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>. On the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> he obtained an interview with his friend, who unhappily durst not venture to afford him shelter under his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a>, so that he was once more compelled to wander in the fields. Worn out at length by hunger and fatigue, and life being no longer supportable without sustenance, he applied at a public house for an omelette, which he devoured with greediness. His cadaverous appearance and uncommonly keen appetite, roused the suspicion of a municipal officer who happened to be present, and by whom he was interrogated. The ambiguity and hesitation which characterized his answers, made the officer conclude that it would be proper to apprehend him. He was accordingly confined to a dungeon, to be next day conducted to Paris, but his melancholy fate rendered such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> unnecessary. He was found dead in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>; and as it was generally understood that he constantly carried with him a dose of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a>, to this cause his melancholy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXIT\">exit</a> was very properly ascribed. Thus terminated the career of Condorcet on the 28th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, 1794, who for many years sustained a brilliant and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> reputation in the republic of letters. His manners were replete with urbanity, and as well qualified to please in company as could be expected in a man who was conceived as destitute of a heart. He was certainly blest with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> felicity, and had one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> by his wife. Soon after his death appeared his \"sketch of a historical draught of the progress of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> mind,\" a methodical performance, and evincing the profoundest research, in which he strongly recommends his favourite idea of gradually bringing human nature to a state of perfection, by considering what man has been, now is, and may be. This treatise will no doubt be viewed by some as rather fanciful, but it is clearly the effort of a very superior genius, and must be peculiarly interesting to the feeling man, when it is known that it was composed while its author was in circumstances of danger and distress. The idea of man's progressive advancement towards perfection and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>, inspired him with consolation under his complicated misfortunes. Besides the works which we have enumerated in this sketch of his life, he published \"letters to the King of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a>,\" with whom he kept up a correspondence, as well as with Catharine, empress of Russia. A treatise on calculation, and an elementary treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a>, were left behind him in manuscript. Although he was an enemy to revealed religion, he was certainly a man of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> and integrity; yet all his philosophy could never inspire him with that heroic fortitude and contempt of death in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> cause, for which the sincere votaries of Christian conformity have ever been so conspicuous.","sp":104,"ep":106},{"h":"CONDORMIENNES","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> sectaries, who take their name from lying all together, men and women, young and old.

Divines ordinarily account for it metaphysically; and will have it take its rise from a miracle, as a fire from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>. Philosophers contend for its being produced from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> causes; and will have it effected according to the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>. Some think an eruption of the central fire sufficient for the purpose, and add, that this may be occasioned several ways, viz. either by having its intensity increased; which again may be effected either by being driven into less space by the encroachments of the superficial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, or by an increase of the inflammability of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> whereon it is fed; or by having the resistance of the imprisoning earth weakened, which may happen either from the diminution of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, by the consumption of its central Confluent parts, or by weakening the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> of the constituent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> by the excess or the defect of moisture. Others look for the cause of the conflagration in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, and suppose, that some of the meteors there engendered in unusual quantities, and exploded with unusual vehemence, from the concurrence of various circumstances, may effect it, without seeking any further. The astrologers account for it from a conjunction of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a> in the sign Cancer; as the deluge, say they, was occasioned by their conjunction in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPRICORN\">Capricorn</a>.

This makes him to have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a> and Solon, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to the days of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a>. He gave striking proofs of very uncommon talents at an early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, which were cultivated and improved with great assiduity under the tuition of the ablest masters. Scarcely had he attained to the years of maturity, when he evinced himself acquainted with all the literature of that period, professing, in particular, a comprehensive knowledge of the canonical and classical books, ascribed to the legislators Yao and Chun, which the Chinese emphatically denominate the five volumes,\nConfucius, as containing the essence of all their science and morality. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> had bestowed upon him a most amiable temper, and his moral deportment was altogether unexceptionable. He acquired a distinguished reputation for humility, sincerity, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of his appetites, a disinterested heart, and a sovereign contempt of wealth. These rare qualities pointed him out as a proper person to fill offices of importance and trust in the government of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, which he did with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to himself and advantage to the empire. These public stations afforded him excellent opportunities of estimating with accuracy the true state of morals among his countrymen, which at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILUTE\">dilute</a> and vicious in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a>. He conceived the godlike idea of attempting a general reformation both in morals and in politics, and his efforts for some time were attended with such remarkable effects, that he inspired his countrymen with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> veneration for his excellent character, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> for his exertions, being raised to a station of the last importance in the kingdom of Lu. Here his counsels and advice were productive of the most beneficial consequences, in establishing good order, the due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCORD\">concord</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECORUM\">decorum</a> through the whole kingdom. As it thus very naturally became an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of admiration, so, likewise, neighbouring princes beheld with envy, its growing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> and prosperity; to destroy which, they contrived a fatal and effectual expedient. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Ts'ing being apprehensive, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the king of Lu <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be directed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> policy of Confucius, he would soon become by far too powerful, sent him and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> a present of the most beautiful young women, trained up from their infancy in all the arts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEDUCTION\">seduction</a>, who were but too successful in plunging the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> into voluptuousness and dissipation. This demolished in a short time, the whole of that beautiful fabric which had been erected by Confucius. Finding it a hopeless attempt to stem the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a> of corruption and depravity, he resolved to exert his talents in some distant kingdom, in the philanthropic cause of moral reformation, in hopes of better success. But he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> to discover, that vice was everywhere triumphant, while <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, that darling of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>, was compelled to hide her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. This induced him to adopt the more humble, although not the less interesting employment, of a teacher of youth, in which he made great and rapid progress. About 600 of his scholars were sent into different parts of the empire, to carry on his favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of moral reformation. Among his disciples, 72 were remarkably distinguished above the rest for their mental acquisitions, and 10 others were deemed superior, even to these, as having a thorough <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>'s whole system. These were divided by him into four classes; the first being destined to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the moral virtues; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> to the arts of logic and public speaking; the third class studied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">jurisprudence</a> and the duties of the civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>; and public speaking, or the delivery of popular discourses on moral topics. Indefatigable, however, as his labours were, the task was too mighty to be accomplished by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> exertions. During his last illness, he declared to his pupils, that the grief of his mind occasioned by the profligacy of human nature was become insupportable; and in a melancholy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, he exclaimed \"Immensely mountain, how art thou fallen?

He finished his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> in the 72nd year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, in his native kingdom, to which he had returned in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with his disciples. It is frequently the fate of illustrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, never to be properly valued till they are cut off by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, which was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with Confucius. The whole empire of China bewailed the loss of him, and erected innumerable edifices to perpetuate his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, adorned with such honourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSCRIPTIONS\">inscriptions</a> as the following: \"To the great master;\" \"To the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a>;\" \"To the saint;\" \"To the wife king of literature;\" \"To the instructor of emperors and kings.\" All his descendants, even to the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, enjoy the honourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> and office of mandarins, and are exempted from the payment of taxes to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>, as well as the princes of the blood. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> who applies for the title of doctor, must previously have made a present to a mandarin descended in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> line from Confucius. The writings of this great man are esteemed by the Chinese as of the highest authority, next to the five volumes, to which he modestly acknowledges himself to have been much indebted. His works are, 1. The Tseu-bio; \"The Grand Science, or School of Adults,\" chiefly intended for the information of princes and magistrates, recommending the duties of self-government, and uniform obedience to the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> reason. 2. The Chong-yong, or \"Immutable Medium,\" in which he shows its importance in the government of the passions by a variety of examples, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out the method of arriving at perfection in virtue. 3. Lung-yun, or moral and sententious discourses, which exhibit a lively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of the opinions, conduct, and maxims of Confucius and his followers. 4. Meng-tse, the book of Mencius, which derived its name from one of that great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>'s disciples. These are all deservedly esteemed by the Chinese, being held next in importance to the five volumes. 5. The Hsiau-king, or dissertation on the duty and respect which children owe their parents; and, 6. The Syau-bio, or science for children, being a judicious collection of moral sentences from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> writers.\n\nIf a fair and impartial estimate of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of Confucius be made, it cannot be viewed in any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> than as uncorrupted deism, although he has sometimes been accused of befriending and secretly propagating atheistical sentiments; but such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a> is as cruel as it is unjust, since the purity of his moral precepts, and the acknowledged rectitude of his whole deportment, are utterly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with such a supposition. He considered the Tyen or Deity as the purest and most perfect essence, principle, and source of all things in the boundless universe, who is absolutely independent, omnipotent, the governor and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">guardian</a> of every thing; possessed of infinite wisdom which nothing can deceive; holy, without partiality, of unlimited goodness and justice. We are at a loss to form any adequate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of his sentiments relative to the soul of man and the doctrine of futurity, having no well authenticated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATA\">data</a>, on which to proceed.

For the illustration of this see LAW <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">INDEX</a>.\n\nCONFUSION of Tongues, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of mankind, is a memorable event, which happened in the one hundred and first year according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">chronology</a>, and the four hundred and first year by the Samaritan, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>, at the overthrow of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BABEL\">Babel</a>; and which was providentially brought about in order to facilitate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPERSION\">dispersion</a> of mankind and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. Until this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> there had been one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, which formed a bond of union that prevented the separation of mankind into distinct nations; and some have supposed, that the tower of Babel was erected as a kind of fortress, by which the people intended to defend themselves against that separation which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOAH\">Noah</a> had projected.\n\nThere has been a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> as to the nature of this confusion, and the manner in which it was effected. Some learned men, prepossessed with the notion that all the different idioms now in the world did at first arise from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> language to which they may be reduced, and that the variety among them is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more than must naturally have happened in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> by the mere separation of the builders of Babel, have maintained, that there were no new languages formed at the confusion; but, that this event was accomplished by creating a misunderstanding and variance among the builders without any immediate influence on their language. But this opinion, advanced by Le Clerc, &c. seems to be directly contrary to the obvious meaning of the word \u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05d1\u05b6\u05dc, \u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05d1\u05b6\u05dc, \"lip,\" used by the sacred historian.\u2014Others have imagined, that this was brought about by a temporary confusion of their speech, or rather of their apprehensions, causing them, whilst they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> together and spoke the same language, to understand the words differently. Scaliger is of this opinion. Others, again, account for this event by the privation of all language, and by supposing that mankind were under a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of associating together, and of imposing new names on things by common consent. Another opinion affirms the confusion to such an indistinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> of the original language which they spoke before, as made them speak it very differently; so that Confusion, by the various inflexions, terminations, and pronunciations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> dialects, they could no more understand one another, than they who understand Latin can understand those who speak French, Italian, or Spanish, though all these languages arise out of it. This opinion is adopted by Calaubon, and by Bishop Patrick in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMENTARY\">Commentary</a> in loc. and is certainly much more probable than either of the former. And Mr Shuckford maintains, that the confusion arose from small beginnings, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of new words in either of the three families of Shem, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAM\">Ham</a>, and Japhet, which might contribute to separate them from one another: and that in each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> new differences of speech might gradually arise, so that each of these families went on to divide and subdivide among themselves. Others, again, as Mr Jof Mede and Dr Wotton, &c., not satisfied with either of the foregoing methods of accounting for the diversity of languages among mankind, have recourse to an extraordinary interposition of divine power, by which new languages were framed and communicated to different families by a supernatural infusion or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a>; which languages have been the roots and originals from which the several dialects that are, or have been, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be spoken, as long as this earth shall last, have arisen, and to which they may with ease be reduced. As to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of languages thus introduced, many opinions have been adopted. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> there were no more than there were nations or heads of nations, then the number would be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> for Japhet, four for Ham, and five for Shem; but if there were as many as there were families, which is the more probable opinion, their number cannot be certainly assigned. However, the Hebrews fancy they were 70, because the descendants from the sons of Noah, enumerated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENESIS\">Genesis</a> x., were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> so many. Allowing, then, the languages of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> families to have been fundamentally different from each other, the sub languages and dialects within each branch would probably have had a mutual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a>, greater or less as they settled nearer or farther from each other. But whichever of these hypotheses is adopted, the primary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of the confusion at Babel was the separation and dispersion of mankind.\n\nDr Bryant, in the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">Analysis</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">Ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-MYTHOLOGY\">Mythology</a>, has advanced a singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, both with respect to the confusion of tongues and the dispersion. He supposes that the confusion of language was local and partial, and limited to Babel only. By \u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05bc\u05d1\u05b0\u05d0\u05b9\u05e8, Gen. xi. 1. and 8. which our translators render the whole earth, he understands every region; and by the same words in ver. 9, the whole region or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>. This confusion was occasioned, as he supposes, by a labial failure; so that the people could not articulate. Thus their speech was confounded, but not altered; for as soon as they separated, they recovered their true tenor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRONUNCIATION\">pronunciation</a>, and the language of the earth continued for some ages nearly the same. The interviews between the Hebrews and other nations, recorded in Scripture, were conducted without an interpreter; and he farther observes, that the various languages which subsist at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> retain sufficient relation to show, that they were once dialects from the same matrix, and that their variety was the effect of time.

See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a>.\n\nIt is not known whether all kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> are naturally capable of congelation or not; though we are certain that there are very great differences among them in this respect. The most difficult of all those of which the congelation has been actually attained is quicksilver. This was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> thought capable of resisting any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> whatever; and it is only within a few years that its congelation by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> means was known, and still more lately that some climates were found to be so severe as to congeal this fluid by the cold of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>.\n\nThe congelation of quicksilver was first ascertained by M. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> Braun, professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSCOW\">Moscow</a>. He had been employed in making thermometrical experiments, not with a view to make the discovery he actually did, but to see how many degrees of cold he could produce. An excellent opportunity for this occurred on the 14th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1759, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> stood naturally at \u201434\u00b0, which is now known to be only five or six degrees above its point of congelation. M. Braun, having determined to avail himself of this great degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> cold, prepared a freezing mixture of nitric acid and pounded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>, by means of which his thermometer was reduced to \u201469\u00b0. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">Part</a> of the quicksilver had now really congealed; yet so far was M. Braun from entertaining any suspicion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, that he had almost desisted from further attempts, being satisfied with having so far exceeded all the philosophers who went before him. Animated, however, by the hopes of producing a still greater degree of cold, he renewed the experiment; but having expended all his pounded ice, he was obliged to substitute snow in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. With this fresh mixture the mercury sunk to \u2014100\u00b0, 240\u00b0, and 352\u00b0. He then supposed that the thermometer was broken; but on taking it out to observe whether it was so or not, he found the quicksilver fixed, and continuing so for 12 minutes. On repeating the same experiment with another thermometer which had been graduated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> lower than \u2014120\u00b0, all the mercury sunk into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>, and became solid as before, not beginning to reascend till after a still longer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. Hence the professor concluded that the quicksilver was really frozen, and prepared for making a decisive experiment. This was accomplished on the 25th of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> of the thermometer broken as soon as the metal was congealed. The mercury was now converted into a solid and shining metallic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, which extended under the strokes of a pebble, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> rather inferior to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, and yielding a dull <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> like that metal. Professor \u00c6pinus made similar experiments at the same time, employing both thermometers and tubes of a larger bore: in which last he remarked, that the quicksilver fell feebly on being frozen, affuming a concave surface, and likewise that the congealed pieces sunk in fluid mercury.\n\nThe fact being thus established, and fluidity no longer to be considered as an essential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of quicksilver, M. Braun communicated an account of his experiments to the Peterburg Academy, on the 6th of September 1760; of which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> extract was inserted in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. iii., p. 156. Five years afterwards he published another treatise on the same subject, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Supplement to his former dissertation. In these he declared, that, since his former publication, he had never suffered any winter to elapse without repeating the experiment of congealing quicksilver, and never failed of success when the natural cold was of a sufficient strength for the purpose. This degree of natural cold he supposes to be \u201410\u00b0 of Fahrenheit, though some commencement\nThe commencement of the congelation might be perceived when the temperature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> was as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as +2\u00b0. The results of all his experiments were, that with the above-mentioned frigorific mixtures, and once with rectified spirits and snow, when the natural cold was at 28\u00b0, he congealed the quicksilver, and discovered that it is a real metal which melts with a very small degree of heat. Not perceiving, however, the necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of its great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> in freezing, he, in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, as well as in the former, confounded its point of congelation with that of its greatest contraction in freezing, and thus marked the former a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> too low; though the point of congelation was very uncertain according to him, various difficulties having occurred to his attempts of finding the greatest point of contraction while freezing.\n\nThe experiments of M. Braun were not repeated by any person till the year 1774, when Mr. John Frederic Blumenbach, then a student of physic at G\u00f6ttingen, performed them to more advantage than it appears M. Braun had ever done. He was encouraged to make the attempt by the excessive cold of the winter that year. \"I put (says he), at five in the evening of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 11th, three drachms of quicksilver into a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>-glass, and covered it with a mixture of snow and Egyptian sal-ammoniac. This mixture was put loose into the glass, so that the quicksilver lay perfectly free, being only covered with it as by pieces of ice; the whole, together with the glass, weighed somewhat above an ounce. It was hung out at a window in such a position as to expose it freely to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west; and two drachms more of sal-ammoniac mixed with the snow on which it stood. The snow and sal-ammoniac, in the open air, soon froze into a mass like ice; no sensible change, however, appeared in the quicksilver that evening; but at one in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> it was found frozen solid. It had divided into two large and four smaller pieces: one of the former was hemispherical, the other cylindrical, each seemingly rather above a drachm in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>; the four small bits might amount to half a scruple. They were all with their flat side frozen hard to the glass, and nowhere immediately touched by the mixture; their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> was a dull <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> with a bluish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>, like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a>, very different from the natural appearance of quicksilver. Next morning, about eleven o'clock, I found that the larger hemisphere began to melt, perhaps because it was most exposed to the air, and not so near as the others to the sal-ammoniac mixture which lay beneath. In this state it resembled an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMALGAM\">amalgam</a>, sinking to that side on which the glass was inclined; but without quitting the surface of the glass, to which it was yet firmly congealed: the five other pieces had not yet undergone any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>, but remained frozen hard. Toward eight o'clock the cylindrical piece began to soften in the same manner, and the other four soon followed. About eight they fell from the surface of the glass, and divided into many fluid shining globules, which were soon lost in the interstices of the frozen mixture, and reunited in part at the bottom, being now exactly like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> quicksilver.\" At the time this experiment was made, the thermometer stood at \u201410\u00b0 in the open air.\n\nThe circumstances attending this experiment are still unaccountable; for, in the first place, the natural cold was scarcely sufficient, along with that of the artificial mixture, which produces 32\u00b0 more, to have congealed the quicksilver; which yet appears to have been very effectually done by the length of time it continued solid. 2. It is not easy to account for the length of time required for congealing the quicksilver in this experiment, since other frigorific mixtures begin to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> almost immediately; and, 3. There was not at last even the appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, which consists in a solution of the snow, and not in its freezing into a mass.\n\n\"The whole experiment (says Dr. Blagden) remains involved in such obscurity, that some persons have supposed the quicksilver itself was not frozen, but only covered over with ice; to which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, however, there are great objections. It is worthy of remark, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOTTINGEN\">Gottingen</a>, though situated in the same latitude as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, and enjoying a temperate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> in general, becomes subject at times to a great severity of cold. This of 11th of January 1774 is one instance: I find others there where the thermometer sunk to \u201412\u00b0, \u201416\u00b0, or \u201419\u00b0; and at Cattlenburg, a small town about two German miles distant, to \u201430\u00b0. By watching such extraordinary occasions, experiments on the freezing of quicksilver might easily be performed in many places, where the possibility of them is at present little suspected. The cold observed at Glasgow in 1780 would have been fully sufficient for that purpose.\"\n\nIn consequence of the publication of M. Braun's Experiments, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> desired their late Secretary Dr Maty to make the necessary application to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUDSON_S_BAY\">Hudson's <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">Bay</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a>, in order to repeat the experiment in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. Mr. Hutchins, who was then at London, and going out with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> as governor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBANY\">Albany</a> fort, offered to undertake the experiments, and executed them very completely, freezing quicksilver twice in the months of January and February 1775. The account of his success was read before the Royal Society at the commencement of the severest winter that had been known for many years in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>; and at this time the experiment was repeated by two gentlemen of different countries. One was Dr Lambert Bicker, secretary to the Batavian society at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROTTERDAM\">Rotterdam</a>; who, on the 28th of January 1776, at eight in the morning, made an experiment to try how low he could bring the thermometer by artificial cold, the temperature of the atmosphere being then +20\u00b0. He could not, however, bring it lower than \u201494\u00b0, at which point it stood immovable; and on breaking the thermometer, part of the quicksilver was found to have lost its fluidity, and was thickened to the consistence of an amalgam. It fell out of the tube in little bits, which bore to be flattened by pressure, without running into globules like the inner fluid part. The experiment was repeated next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, when the thermometer stood at +8\u00b0, but the mercury would not then defend below \u201480\u00b0; and as the thermometer was not broken, it could not be known whether the mercury had congealed or not. All that could be inferred from these experiments therefore was, that the congealing point of mercury was not below \u201494\u00b0 of Fahrenheit's thermometer. The other who attempted the congelation of this fluid was the late Dr. Anthony Fothergill; but it could not be determined whether...\nwhether he succeeded or not. An account of his experiment is inserted in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. lxvi.\n\nNo other attempts were made to congeal quicksilver until the year 1781, when Mr. Hutchins resumed the subject with great success, informing that from his experiments the freezing point of mercury is now almost as well settled as that of water. Preceding philosophers, indeed, had not been altogether inattentive to this subject. Professor Braun himself had taken great pains to investigate it; but for want of paying the requisite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the contraction of the fluid mercury by cold and that of the congealing metal by freezing, he could determine nothing certain concerning it. Others declared it as their opinion, that nothing certain could be determined by merely freezing mercury in a thermometer filled with that fluid. Mr. Cavendish and Dr. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> first suggested the proper method of obviating the difficulties on this subject. Dr. Black, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Mr. Hutchins, dated October 5, 1779, gave the following directions for making the experiment with accuracy:\n\n\"Provide a few wide and short tubes of thin glass, sealed at one end and open at the other; the wideness of these tubes may be from half to three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of an inch, and the length of them about three inches. Put an inch or an inch and a half depth of mercury into one of these tubes, and plunging the bulb of the thermometer into the mercury, set the tube with the mercury and the thermometer in it into a freezing mixture, which should be made for this purpose in a common tumbler or water glass: and, N.B., in making a freezing mixture with snow and nitric acid, the quantity of the acid should never be so great as to dissolve the whole of the snow, and only enough to reduce it to the consistence of panada. When the mercury in the wide tube is thus set in the freezing mixture, it must be stirred gently and frequently with the bulb of the thermometer; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the cold be sufficiently strong, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> congeal by becoming thick like an amalgam. As soon as this is observed, the thermometer should be examined without lifting it out of the congealing mercury; and I have no doubt that in every experiment thus made, with the same mercury, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> will always point to the same degree, provided it has been made and graduated with accuracy.\"\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> recommended by Mr. Cavendish, and which Mr. Hutchins made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of, consisted of a small mercurial thermometer, the bulb of which reaches about 2\u00bd inches below the scale, and was inclosed in a glass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> swelled at the bottom into a ball, which when used was filled with quicksilver, so that the bulb of the thermometer was entirely covered with it. If this cylinder be immersed in a freezing mixture till great part of the quicksilver in it is frozen, it is evident that the degree shown at that time by the inclosed thermometer is the precise point at which mercury freezes; for as in this case the ball of the thermometer must be surrounded for some time with quicksilver, part of which is actually frozen, it seems impossible that the thermometer should be sensibly above that point; and while any of the quicksilver in the cylinder remains fluid, it is impossible that it should sink sensibly below it. The diameter of the bulb of the thermometer was rather less than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an inch, that of the swelled part of the cylinder two-thirds; and as it was easy to keep the thermometer constantly in the middle of the cylinder, the thickness of quicksilver between it and the glass could never be much less than the fifth part of an inch. The bulb of the thermometer was purposely made as small as it conveniently could, in order to leave a sufficient space between it and the cylinder, without making the swelled part larger than necessary, which would have caused more difficulty in freezing the mercury in it.\n\nThe first experiment with this apparatus was made on the 15th of December 1781; the thermometer had stood the evening before at \u201418\u00b0. A bottle of spiritus nitri fortis was put on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>-top, in order to cool it to the same temperature. The thermometers made use of had been hung up in the open air for three weeks, to compare their scales. On the morning of the experiment they were about 23\u00b0 below zero.\u2014In making it, the thermometer of the apparatus was suspended in the bulb of the cylinder by means of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-WORSTED\">worsted</a> wound about the upper part of its stem, to a sufficient thickness to fill the upper part of its orifice; and a space of near half an inch was left empty between the quicksilver and worsted.\n\nThe apparatus was placed in the open air, on the top of the fort, with only a few deer skins sewed together for a shelter; the snow lay 18 inches deep on the works, and the apparatus was sunk into the snow, in order to bring it sooner to the temperature of the air. The instruments were afterwards placed in three fresh freezing mixtures, in hopes of being able by their means to produce a greater degree of cold, but without effect; nor was any greater cold produced by adding more nitric acid. The mercury, however, was very completely frozen, that in the thermometer descending to \u2014448\u00b0. On plunging the mercury into the freezing mixture, it descended in less than one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> to 40\u00b0 below zero.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> experiment was made the day following; and the same quantity of quicksilver employed that had been used in the former. As too small a quantity of the freezing mixture, however, had been originally made, it was necessary to add more during the operation of congelation; by which means the spirit of nitre, in pouring it upon the snow, sometimes touched the bulb of the thermometer, and instantly raised it much higher; nor did the mercury ever descend below 206\u00b0, which was not half as far as it had done the day before, though the temperature of the atmosphere had been this day at \u201434\u00b0 before the commencement of the operation. That in the apparatus, however, sunk to \u201495\u00b0. The apparatus was taken out of the mixture for half a minute, in order to examine whether the mercury was perfectly congealed or not, and during that time it showed no sign of liquefaction.\n\nThe third experiment was made the same day, and with the freezing mixture used in the last. By it the point of congelation was determined to be not below 40\u00b0.\n\nThe fourth experiment was made January 7th 1782; and\nand in it he observed, that the mercury in the apparatus thermometer, after standing at 42 and 41\u00bd for a considerable time, fell to 77, not gradually, but at once as a weight falls.\n\nIn the fifth experiment the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> was excessively severe, so that it ought to have frozen the metal in the open air; but this did not then happen.\n\nAt the time of making the fifth experiment, the quicksilver in the open air stood at 44 below 0; and Mr Hutchins resolved to make use of this opportunity to observe how far it was possible to make it descend by means of cold, observing the degrees at the same time with a spirit thermometer made by Nairne and Blount, with which he had been furnished by the Royal Society in 1773. In this, however, he did not succeed; for the mercury never fell below 438, nor the standard 48. It stood at 27\u00bd at the beginning of the experiment. The reason of this was supposed to be, that the atmosphere was too cold for making this kind of experiment, by reason of its freezing the thread of quicksilver in the stem of the thermometer, so that it became incapable of contraction along with that in the bulb. In other experiments, though the metal in the bulb became solid, yet that in the stem always remained fluid; and thus was enabled to subside to a great degree by the diminution of bulk in the solid mercury. That this was really the case, appeared from the quicksilver falling at once from \u201486 to \u2014434, when the cold of the freezing mixture diminished, and the temperature of the air becoming about the same time somewhat milder, melted the congealed part in the stem, which thus had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to descend to that point.\n\nIn this experiment, also, the mixtures were made in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> quantity to those of the former; these being only in common tumblers, but the mixtures for this experiment in pint-basons. It was observed that they liquefied faster than in other experiments. He had usually made them of the consistence of pap; but though he added snow at different times, it had very little effect in augmenting the cold, but rather decreased it. The congealed pieces of the metal fell to the bottom, as might naturally have been expected from its great contraction in becoming solid.\n\nFrom this experiment Mr Hutchins concluded, that the nearer the temperature of the atmosphere approached to the congealing point of mercury (so that a great degree of cold might be communicated to the bulb of a thermometer, and yet the quicksilver in the tube remain fluid), he might make the experiment of ascertaining the greatest contraction of mercury to more advantage. With this view, he made another experiment, when the temperature of some of his thermometers stood as low as \u201437\u00b0; and after an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>'s attendance, he perceived the mercury had fallen to 1367; but the thermometer unluckily was broken, and its bulb thrown away with the mixture. Professor Braun had likewise observed, that his thermometers were always broken when the mercury descended below 600.\n\nThe eighth experiment was made with a view to try whether quicksilver would congeal when in contact with the freezing mixture. For this purpose, he did not use the apparatus provided for other experiments, but filled a galipot made of flint <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> (as being thinner than the common fort), containing about an ounce, half full of quicksilver, into which he inserted a mercurial thermometer, employing another as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a>. Thus he hoped to determine exactly when the quicksilver was congealed, as he had free access to it at all times, which was not the case when it was inclosed in the cylindrical glass, the worsted wound round the tube of the thermometer to exclude the air being equally effectual in excluding any instrument from being introduced to touch the quicksilver. He then made a kind of skewer, with a flat blunt point, of dried <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEDAR\">cedar</a>-wood, on account of its lightness, which he found would remain in the gelatinous freezing mixture at any depth he chose; but, when inserted into the quicksilver, the great difference betwixt the specific gravity of it and that ponderous fluid, made it always rebound upward; and by the degree of resistance, he could always know whether it proceeded from fluid or solid metal. At this time, however, the experiment did not succeed; but, at another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, having employed about \u00bc lbs of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of metal, and let it remain a considerable time immersed in the same mixture which had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> now been supposed to fail, he found that part of it was congealed; and, on pouring off the fluid part, no less than two-thirds remained fixed at the bottom.","sp":111,"ep":114},{"h":"CONGERIES","t":"a Latin word, sometimes used in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> for a collection <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> heap of several particles of bodies united into one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> or aggregate.","sp":121,"ep":121},{"h":"CONGESTION","t":"in Medicine, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> collection of humours, crowded together and hardened in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the body, and there forming a preternatural tumor.\n\nCongestion is effected by little and little; in which it differs from defluxion, which is more sudden.","sp":121,"ep":121},{"h":"CONGIARIUM","t":"CONGIARIUM, CONGIARY, among medalists, a gift <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> donative represented on a medal.

According to these limits, Congo Proper extends about three degrees from north to south; lying between the line and 18\u00b0 S. Lat.; but widens in its breadth inland, by the course of the river Zair, which runs winding above two degrees more to the north. Its length from east to west is very uncertain, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> observations have been taken of the exact situation of those mountains which bound it.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of this kingdom affords but few interesting particulars. Before its discovery by the Portuguese, the history is altogether uncertain and fabulous, as the inhabitants were totally unacquainted with letters and learning. So little were they acquainted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">chronology</a>, that it is said they did not even distinguish between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> and night; much less could they compute their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> by moons or years; and therefore could remember past transactions only by saying they happened in such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s reign.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> was discovered by the Portuguese in 1484. The discoverer was named Diego <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAM\">Cam</a>, an Congo expert and bold soldier. He was very well received by the natives, and sent some of his men with presents to the king; but they being detained by unexpected accidents beyond the promised time of their return, Cam was obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> away without them, the Portugese took with him four young Congolese as hostages for the safety of his countrymen. These he taught the Portuguese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, in which they made such progress that King John was highly pleased, and sent them back next year to Congo with rich presents; charging them to exhort their monarch, in his name, to become a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> to the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, and to permit it to be propagated through his dominions. A firm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> was concluded between the two monarchs, which continues to this day, though not without some interruptions, to which the Portuguese themselves have given occasion more than the natives.\n\nAny particular account we have of this kingdom, rests almost entirely on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> of Anthony Cavazzi, the traveller above mentioned. He was a capu-Congo chin friar, a native of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUCHY\">duchy</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODENA\">Modena</a>, and was sent missionary into those parts de propaganda fide, in the year 1654, and arrived at Congo the same year. During his stay there, his zeal to make converts made him travel through all these different kingdoms; and the credit he gained, as well as the great employments he was intrusted with, gave him an opportunity of informing himself of every thing relating to them with great exactness. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> and situation, however, he could not possibly ascertain, for want of instruments; nor hath this defect been since supplied. According to him the dominions of Congo extended a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> further eastward and southwards before the introduction of Christianity than afterwards; a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> that were under the Congolese monarchs, either as subjects, or tributary, having withdrawn their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> out of dislike to them on that account. Not content with opposing the officers and troops that came annually to raise the tribute imposed by the king, they made such frequent and powerful incursions into his dominions, that they obliged him to draw his forces nearer the centre of Congo to prevent an invasion; by which means the kingdom, from an extent of 600 leagues, was reduced to less than one half.\n\nCongo Proper being situated within the torrid zone, is liable to excessive heats; as it lies on the southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> side of the equinoctial, the seasons are of course opposite to ours. They reckon only two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> seasons, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> and winter; the former begins in October, and continues till February or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>; during which time the sun's rays dart with such force, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> appears to an European to be in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>. The excessive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, however, is mitigated by the equal length of the days and nights, as well as by the winds, breezes, rains, and dews. The winter takes up the other part of the year; and is said by the natives to be proportionally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, though to an European it would appear hot. These two seasons they divide into six lesser ones, viz. Maflanza, Neasu, Ecundi, Quitombo, Quibilo, and Qitibangala.\n\nMaflanza begins with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of October, which is the beginning of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>. The rains begin to fall at that time, and continue during the next two\nand sometimes three months. When this happens, the low lands are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> overflowed with extraordinary floods, and all their corn carried off. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of this kind is commonly followed by a famine; for the lazy inhabitants take no care to lay up any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, although such misfortunes happen very frequently. This first season they reckon commences at the time the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> begin to spring.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> season, Neafu, begins about the end of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a>, when the produce of their lands has arrived at its full height, and wants but a few days of being ripened for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a>. This first crop is no sooner gathered in, than they sow their fields afresh, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> commonly yielding them two harvests.\n\nThe third and fourth seasons, called Ecundi and Quitombo, are frequently blended together towards the middle of March, when the more gentle rains begin to fall, and continue till the month of May. These two seasons are distinguished by the greater or lesser <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> that falls during that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>. During the rest of the time, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is either very clear, hot, and dry; or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> being overcharged with electric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, burst out into the most terrible thunders and lightnings, without yielding the least drop of rain, though they seem loaded with it.\n\nThe two last, viz. the Quibiso and Quibangala, make up their short winter, which consists not in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROST\">frost</a> or snow, but in dry, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLASTING\">blasting</a> winds, which strip the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> of all its verdure, till the next Massanze begins to restore them to their former bloom.\n\nThey now divide their year into twelve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> months, and begin it in September. They have also weeks consisting of four days only, the last of which is their Sabbath; and on it they religiously abstain from every kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>. This practice, the compilers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> History conjecture to have arisen from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> laziness for which this people, and indeed all the African nations, are so remarkable. To this shameful indolence also is to be ascribed the little produce they reap from their lands, while the Portuguese settled among them, who are at more pains in the cultivation of theirs, enjoy all manner of plenty. The natives, however, had rather run the risk of the most terrible famines, than be at the tenth part of the labour they see the Portuguese take. They seem to think it below them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> any other exercises than those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAPING\">leaping</a>, hunting, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a>, &c.; the rest of their time they spend in smoking, and downright idleness, committing the laborious part of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a> affairs to their slaves, or, in want of them, to their wives. Nothing is more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> than to see these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> creatures toiling in the fields and woods with a child tied to their backs, and fainting under their excessive labour and heavy burdens, or (which is still worse) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a> and thirst. What is yet more surprisingly shameful is, that though they have plenty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> animals which they might easily make use of for cultivating their grounds, and for other laborious services, and though they see the Portuguese do it every day to great advantage; yet they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> rather see their tender females sink under their toil and labour, than be at the trouble of breeding up any of these useful creatures to their affluence.\n\nThe ground produces variety of grain, but no corn or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a> except what is cultivated by the Portuguese. Their maize, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> wheat, grows very strong, and is well <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a>. This being well ground, they make vegetables into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, or boil with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> into a kind of pap. Of produced in this they have four kinds; one of which, resembling Congo, what we call French wheat, is produced in plenty, and makes some amends for the want of industry in the people. They cultivate also a variety of the peas and bean kind: but what they chiefly live upon, as most suitable to their lazy disposition, is a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a>, like our filberts, which fall to the ground of themselves, and are to be found everywhere; every nut that falls to the ground producing a new shrub next year. They have scarcely any fruit-trees but what have been brought hither by the Portuguese. They have various sorts of palm-trees, useful both by their fruit, leaves, and their juice, which is easily converted into wine; also by affording a kind of oil with which they dress their victuals, though the Europeans use it only to burn in their lamps. They have also a vast number of plants and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>, which it would be impossible to describe or enumerate. Wheat is the only thing that the ground will not produce. It pushes forth, indeed, the straw and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>; the former of which grows <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> enough we are told, to hide a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> on horseback, but the latter is empty, without one grain fit for use. Father Labat, however, who had lived a considerable time in some of the American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, where he had observed the same thing, tells us, that he had the curiosity to examine those ears more carefully, and had found some few grains; and that, having sowed them afresh, they produced very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> ears, full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> heavy grain. Whence he conjectures, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the Portuguese had tried the same experiment in their African settlements, it might perhaps have been attended with the same success.\n\nIn the low lands the grass grows so high, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, hazardous and thick, that it becomes one of the most dangerous travelling receptacles for wild beasts, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a>, and other venomous insects: on this account travelling is exceedingly hazardous, as there are few beaten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> in the whole country, and travellers are obliged to march over it through vast plains, in continual danger of being devoured or flung to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; to say nothing of the manifold diseases produced by the unwholesome dews with which the grass is covered during some part of the day. The only method of guarding against all these evils effectually, is by setting fire to the grass in the hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, when it is quite parched by the heat of the sun: but even this cannot be done without the greatest danger; because both the wild beasts and venomous reptiles, being roused out of their places of retirement, will fly furiously at those who happen to be in the way. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> there is no possibility of escaping, but by climbing up the highest trees, or defending one's self with fire-arms or other weapons. In such emergencies, the natives have a much better chance than the Europeans; the former being able to climb trees with surprising swiftness; while the latter must be assisted with rope-ladders, which they commonly cause their blacks to carry about with them, and to go up and fall to one of the branches.\n\nThe flowers are here exceedingly beautiful and numerous. Almost every field and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROVE\">grove</a> yields a multitude of nobler flowers.\nnobler prospect than the European gardens can boast of, notwithstanding the pains bestowed on their cultivation. The flowers are remarkable, not only for the prodigious variety of their colours, but the vast quantity of heads which grow upon one stalk. In the daytime, indeed, they seem to have lost their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> fragrance; that being in some measure exhaled by the heat of the sun; but this is amply compensated after its setting, and more especially a little before its rising, when their sweetness is again condensed, and revived by the coldness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a> of the night, after which they exhale their various refreshing scents in a much higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> than ours. The lilies, which there grow naturally in the fields, valleys, and woods, excel those of our gardens, not only in their extreme whiteness, but much more in a delightful fragrance, without offending the head, as the European lilies do by their faintest sweetness. The tulips which there grow wild, though generally called Peric, have something to surprisingly charming in the variety and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of their colours, that they dazzle the eyes of an intense beholder: neither do their flowers grow singly as with us, but ten or twelve upon one stalk; and with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> advantage, that they diffuse a very reviving and agreeable sweetness, and continue much longer in their full bloom. Of the same nature are their tuberose, hyacinths, and other native flowers; which spring up in vast groups of 100 and 200 from one root, though somewhat smaller than ours; some of them finely variegated, and all of them yielding an agreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>. The roses, jessamines, and other exotics brought hither from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, come up likewise in great perfection, but require a constant supply of water, and diligent attendance, to prevent them from degenerating. The American jessamine, in particular, instead of single flowers, will grow up by dozens in a bunch; some of them of an exquisite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, and others of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of the most vivid fire.\n\nA vast variety of animals of different kinds are found in the kingdom of Congo; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of which is the elephant. This creature is mostly found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Bamba, which abounds with woods, pasture, and plenty of water; the elephants delighting much to bathe themselves during the heat of the day. They commonly go in troops of a hundred or more; and some of them are of such a monstrous size, that we are told the print of their hoof hath measured four, nay seven, spans in diameter. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> of their tails, and that of some other animals, the natives, especially the women, weave themselves collars, bracelets, girdles, &c. with variety of devices and figures, which denote their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>; and are in such esteem, that the hair of two elephants tails is sufficient to buy a slave. The reason of this is, that the natives have not the art of taming them, but are obliged to send some of the bravest and stoutest men to hunt them in the woods; which is not done without great labour and danger, they being here exceedingly fierce. The most common way of hunting them is by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a> deep holes in the ground, the top of which they cover with branches and leaves, as is practised in most parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>.\n\nLions, leopards, tigers, wolves, and other beasts of prey, abound here in great plenty, and do much damage. Here are also a vast variety of monkeys of all sizes and shapes. The zebra, well known for its extreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and swiftness, is also met with in this country. They have also a variety of buffaloes and wild asses; but the dante seems to be an animal peculiar to this kingdom. It is shaped and coloured much like an ox, though not so large. Its skin is commonly bought by the Portuguese, and sent into Germany to be tanned and made into targets, which are then called dantes. The natives make use of their raw hide dried to make their shields; which are so tough that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARROW\">arrow</a> or dart can pierce them; and they are also large enough to cover the whole body. The creature is vastly swift; and when wounded, will follow the scent or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a> with such fury, that the hunter is obliged to climb up a tree with all possible speed; and this retreat he always takes care to secure before he ventures to fire. The wounded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a> finding its enemy out of its reach, stays for him at the foot of the tree, and will not stir from it; of which the hunter taking the advantage, dispatches it with repeated shots. The forests of Congo also swarm with wild dogs, who, like the wolves, prey upon the tame cattle, and are so fierce that they will attack armed men. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> are exceeding keen and sharp; they never bark, but make a dreadful howling when famished or in pursuit of their prey.\n\nThis country also abounds with all the different birds, kinds of birds that are to be found in other warm climates. One fort, which they call birds of mercy, is greatly esteemed, inasmuch that persons of the highest rank have from time immemorial taken the greatest delight in keeping them in cages and aviaries for the sake of their surprising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELODY\">melody</a>. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, as the Congolese are superstitious to the last degree, there are several kinds of birds which they look upon as ominous, and are so terrified at the sight or hearing of them, that if they were going to enter upon every momentous an expedition, if they were met in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, or going to engage an enemy with ever so great an advantage, the flight or cry of such birds would throw them into a general panic, and disperse them in the utmost haste and confusion. The most dreadful of the ominous kind are the crows, ravens, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATS\">bats</a>, and owls. The great owl is the most terrible of all, and to him they give the name of karian pemba, by which words they likewise denote the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a>.\n\nFishes of different kinds abound on the coasts of Congo in great numbers; but the inland parts are infested with such numbers of serpents, scorpions, and other venomous insects, as are perhaps sufficient to overbalance every natural advantage we have yet mentioned. The most pernicious and dangerous kind are the ants; Ants very of which they reckon no less than six several species of dangerous different colours and sizes; all of them formidable on account of their prodigious numbers, and the mischief they do not only to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of the earth, but to men and beasts; whom they will surround in the night time, and devour even to the very bone. It is a common practice, we are told, to condemn persons guilty of some atrocious crimes to be stripped naked, tied hand and foot, and thrown into a hole where these insects swarm; where they are sure to be devoured by them in less than 24 hours to the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>. But criminals are not the only persons who are in danger from the\nthe jaws of these little devouring insects. People may be attacked by them, as we have already hinted, in the night-time, and while they are sleeping in their beds. This obliges the natives to be careful where they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, and to kindle a small fire, or at least to have a circle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> hot embers round their beds. This caution is still more necessary in the country villages and hamlets, where persons are otherwise in danger of being attacked by millions of them in the dead of the night. In such a case the only expedient to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> one's self is to jump up as soon as one feels the bite, to bath them off with all possible speed, and then at once to set the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> on fire. The danger is still greater in travelling through the country, where a person is often obliged to take up his lodging on the bare ground; and may be overtaken during the heat of the day with such profound <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, as not to be awakened by these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTIVE\">diminutive</a> animals till they have made their way through the skin; and in such a case nothing will prevent their devouring a man alive, though there were ever so many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> to assist him: in such incredible quantities do these creatures abound, notwithstanding the great numbers of monkeys who are continually ferreting the ants out of their retreats, and feed upon them with the utmost avidity. This can only be ascribed to the natural laziness and indolence of the inhabitants; which is such, that they not only neglect to rid their lands of them by proper cultivation, but will suffer their houses, nay, even their very churches, to be undermined by them. Another kind of these destructive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMIN\">vermin</a> lie so thick upon the paths and highways, that a person cannot walk without treading upon, and having his legs and thighs almost devoured by them. A third sort of a white and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> colour, but very small, will gnaw their way through the hardest wood, penetrate into a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>, and in a little while devour all the clothes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, and every thing that is in it. A fourth sort, small and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, leave a most intolerable stench upon every thing they touch or crawl over, whether clothes or household stuff, which are not easily sweetened again; or if they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> over victuals, they are entirely spoiled. A fifth sort harbour chiefly on the leaves and branches of trees; and if a man chance to climb up thither to save himself from a wild beast, he is so tormented by them, that nothing but the fear of the jaws of the one could make him endure the stings of the other. A sixth sort is of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> kind; and is probably one of the former kinds, that live wholly under ground, till nature furnishes them with wings. After this, they rise in such swarms as darken the air, and would make terrible havoc among all kinds of vegetables, did not the natives come out against them in whole companies, and by dint of flaps, and other flat weapons, knock them down by myriads, and then laying them in heaps, set fire to their wings, which half broil them for food. Amidst all this variety of pernicious insects, however, they have one species of a more friendly and profitable kind, viz. the industrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEE\">bee</a>, which furnishes the inhabitants with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a> and wax in such plenty, that there is scarce a holm very low tree, cleft of a rock, or chop of the earth, in which their combs are not found in great quantities.\n\nWith respect to the populousness of the kingdom of Congo, some authors, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> either from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> conjecture, or at best precarious inferences, have represented it as thinly peopled. The accounts of the missionaries and Portuguese, however, are directly opposite to these. They found the country for the most part covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> and villages, and these swarming with inhabitants; the cities well filled with people, particularly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>, which is said to contain above 50,000 souls. The provinces, though not equally populous, yet in the whole make up such an amount as plainly proves, that what is wanting in the one is amply made up by the other. We are told that the duchy of Bamba is still able to raise 200,000 fighting men, and was formerly in a condition to raise double that number; and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of the king of Congo, in the year 1665, consisted of 900,000 fighting men, who were attended by an infinite number of women, children, and slaves. The numbers of the Congolese will appear the more credible, when we consider the extreme fecundity of their women, the hardiness with which they bring up their children, and the stoutness and healthiness of their men. In some villages, if the missionaries are to be credited, the number of children is so great, that a father will part with one or two, for any commodity he wants, or even for some trifling bauble he fancies; so that the number of slaves they fell abroad seldom amounts, communibus annis, to less than 15,000 or 16,000.\n\nThere is scarcely a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> on earth that have a higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of themselves or their country than the Congolese, or that is more hardened against all conviction to the contrary, from reason, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, or the most impartial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with other countries in Europe or Asia. Indeed it is impossible they should think otherwise, when it is one of the fundamentals of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a>, that the rest of the world was the work of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a>, but that the kingdom of Congo, in its full and ancient extent, was the handywork of the Supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">Architect</a>; and must of course have vast prerogatives and advantages over all others. When told of the magnificence of the European and Asiatic courts, their immense revenues, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> of their palaces and edifices, the richness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of their subjects, the great progress they have made in the arts and sciences to which their country is wholly a stranger, they coolly answer, that all this comes vastly short of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> and splendour of the kings and kingdom of Congo; and that there can be but one Congo in the world, to the happiness of whose monarch and people all the rest were created to contribute, and to whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a> the sea and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> pay their constant tribute of zimbis (or shells, which are their current <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>); whilst other princes must condescend to enrich themselves by digging through rocks and mountains, to come at the excrements of the earth, so they flyle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> and silver which are in such request among other nations. Accordingly, they imagine, that the nations which come to traffic with them, are forced to that fervent employment by their poverty and the badness of their country, rather than induced to it by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> or avarice; whilst they themselves can indulge their natural indolence or sloth, though attended with the most pinching poverty, rather than disgrace the dignity of their blood by the least effort of industry, which, how laudable and beneficial soever, is looked upon by them as only a lesser degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>. But though they generally esteem it so much below their dignity to apply to any useful\nuseful work, they think it no disgrace to beg or steal.\n\nWith respect to the first, they are said to be the most shameless and importunate beggars in the world. They will take no denial, spare no crouching, lying, prayers, to obtain what they want, nor curies and ill language when sent away without it. With regard to the last, they deem no theft unlawful or scandalous, except it be committed in a private manner, without the knowledge of the person wronged. It is esteemed a piece of bravery and gallantry to wrench any thing from another by violence; and this kind of theft is so common, not only among the vulgar, but also among the great ones, that they make no scruple, in their travels from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> to place, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> not only upon all the provisions they meet with in towns and villages, but upon every thing else that falls in their way. These violences oblige the poor people to conceal the few valuables they have, in some secret place out of the knowledge and reach of those harpies; and they think themselves well off if they can escape a severe bastinadoing, or other cruel usage, frequently inflicted upon them, in order to make them discover the place of their concealment.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> of the natives, both men and women, is black, though not in the same degree; some being of a much deeper black than others. Their hair is black and finely curled; some have it also of a dark <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> colour; their eyes are mostly of a lively black; but some are of a dark sea-colour. They have neither flat noses nor thick lips like the Nubians and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a>. Their stature is mostly of the middle size; and, excepting their black complexion, they much resemble the Portuguese. In their temper they are mistrustful, envious, jealous, and treacherous; and where they once take a dislike or affront, will spare no pains, and stick at no means, however base, to be avenged of, and crush their enemy under their feet. There is no such thing among them as natural affection. A husband, if a Heathen, may take as many wives as he pleases; and if a Christian, may have any number of concubines, whom he may divorce at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, or even sell them though with child. So little regard have they for their children, that there is scarce one among them who will not sell a son or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>, or perhaps both, for a piece of cloth, a collar or girdle of coral or beads, and often for a bottle of wine or brandy.\n\nThe religion of the Congoese in many parts is downright idolatry, accompanied with the most ridiculous superstitions, and the most absurd and detestable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> invented by their gangas or priests; and even in those parts where Christianity is professed, it is so darkened by superstitions of one kind or other, that we may justly question whether the people are any gainers by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of this kingdom is monarchical, and as despotic as any in Asia or Africa. The kings are the sole proprietors of all the lands within their dominions; and these they can dispose of to whom they please, upon condition they pay a certain tribute out of them; upon failure of the payment of which, or any other neglect, they turn them out. Even the princes of the blood are subjected to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>; so that there is no person of any rank or quality whatever that can bequeath a foot of land to his heirs or successors; and when these owners under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> die, the lands immediately return to it again, whether they were in their possession, or had been left to ever so many tenants under them; so that it entirely depends on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> whether these lands shall be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in the same, or be disposed into other hands. The Portuguese, however, since their settling in these parts, have prevailed upon the monarchs to permit the heirs and successors to continue in the quiet possession of such lands, in order to avoid the confusions, or even rebellions, which the alienation and deprival of them frequently occasioned, and to oblige the tenants of them to pay their tribute more exactly and readily than they did before.\n\nSt Salvador is the chief place of trade in this country belonging to the Portuguese and other Europeans. There are thought to be about 4000 of them settled here, who trade with most parts of the kingdom. The chief commodities they bring hither are either the product of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRAZIL\">Brazil</a> or European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>. The former consist chiefly of grains, fruits, plants, &c.; the latter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARPETS\">carpets</a>, English cloth, and other stuffs; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> vessels, some kinds of blue earthen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WARE\">ware</a>, rings, and ornaments of gold, silver, and other baser <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>; coral, glass-beads, bugles, and other trinkets; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> stuffs made of cotton, woollen, and linen, for clothing; and a great variety of tools and other utensils. In return for these, they carry off a great number of slaves, amounting to 15,000 or 16,000 annually, as we have already observed. Formerly they used also to carry away elephants' teeth, furs, and other commodities of the country; but these branches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> are now greatly decayed, and the slave-trade is what the Portuguese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> principally depend on.\n\nCongo, a term applied to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a> of the second quality.","sp":121,"ep":126},{"h":"CONGREGATION","t":"an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> of several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a>, united to as to constitute a body.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> is principally used for assemblies of cardinals appointed by the pope, and distributed into several chambers, for the discharge of certain functions and jurisdictions, after the manner of our offices and courts.

Mr Congreve entered into the Middle-Temple when he came to England, and began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>; but his bias was toward polite literature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>. His first performance was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVEL\">novel</a>, entitled, Incognita, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">Love</a> and Duty reconciled. He soon after began his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMEDY\">comedy</a> of the Old Bachelor; which was the amusement of some leisure hours during a slow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> from a fit of illness soon after his return to England; yet was in itself so perfect, that Mr Dryden, on its being shown to him, declared he had never in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> seen such a first play. When brought on the stage in 1693, it met with such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> approbation, that Mr Congreve, though he was but 19 years old at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> it, became now considered as a prop to the declining stage, and a rising genius in dramatic poetry. The next year he produced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">Double</a> Dealer; which, for what reason is not obvious, did not meet with so much success as the former. The merit of his first play, however Congreve, had obtained him the favour and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALIFAX\">Halifax</a>, and some peculiar mark of distinction from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>; on whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, which happened in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of this year, he wrote a very elegant elegiac pastoral. In 1695, when Betterton opened the new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a>'s-Inn fields, Mr Congreve joining with him, gave him his comedy of Love for Love, with which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> opened their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a>, and which met with such success, that they immediately offered the author a share in the management of the house, on condition of his furnishing them with one play yearly. This offer he accepted; but whether through indolence, or that correctness which he looked upon as necessary to his works, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">Mourning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDE\">Bride</a> did not come out till 1697, nor his Way of the World till two years after that. The indifferent success this last mentioned play, though an exceeding good one, met with from the public, completed that disgust to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>, which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> contest with Jeremy Collier, who had attacked the immorality of the English stage, and more especially some of his pieces, had begun, and he determined never more to write for the stage. However, though he quitted dramatic writing, he did not lay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> entirely; but occasionally wrote many little pieces both in prose and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>, all of which stand on the records of literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>. It is very possible, however, that he might not so soon have given way to this disgust, had not the easiness of his circumstances rendered any subservience to the opinions and caprices of the town absolutely unnecessary to him. For his abilities having very early in life raised him to the acquaintance of the earl of Halifax, who was then the Mecenas of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>; that nobleman, desirous of raising to promising a genius above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of too hasty productions, made him one of the commissioners for licensing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HACKNEY\">hackney</a>-coaches; or, according to Coxeter, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSIONER\">commissioner</a> of the wine-licence. He soon after bestowed on him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the pipe-office; and not long after gave him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> in the customs worth 600l. per annum. In the year 1718, he was appointed secretary of Jamaica; so that the whole of his income towards the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his life was upwards of 1200l. a-year.\n\nThe greatest part of the last 20 years of his life was spent in ease and retirement; and he either did not, or affected not to give himself any trouble about reputation. Yet some part of that conduct might proceed from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a>; to which purpose, T. Gibber, in his Lives of the Poets, vol. iv. p. 93. relates the following anecdote of him: \"When the celebrated Voltaire was in England, he waited upon Mr Congreve, and paid some compliments upon the merit and reputation of his works. Congreve thanked him; but at the same time told that ingenious foreigner, that he did not choose to be considered as an author, but only as a private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, and in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> expected to be visited. Voltaire answered, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he had never been anything but a private gentleman, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> he had never been troubled with that visit.\" He observes, in his own account of the transaction, that he was not a little disgusted with so unbecoming a piece of vanity.\n\nTowards the close of his life he was much afflicted with the gout; and making a tour to Bath for the benefit\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGRUITY\">Congruity</a>, next of the waters, was unfortunately overturned in his chariot; by which, it is supposed, he got some inward bruise, as he ever after complained of a pain in his side; and, on his return to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> gradually declining in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, till the 19th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1729, when he died, aged 57; and, on the 26th following, was buried in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">Abbey</a>, the pall being supported by persons of the first distinction.","sp":127,"ep":128},{"h":"CONGRUITY","t":"a suitableness <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> relation of agreement between things.\n\nThe terms congruity and propriety are not applicable to any single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>: they imply a plurality, and obviously signify a particular relation between different objects. Thus we currently say, that a decent garb is suitable or proper for a judge; modest behaviour for a young woman; and a lofty style for an epic poem: and on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, that it is unsuitable or incongruous to see a little woman sunk in an overgrown farthingale, a coat richly embroidered covering coarse and dirty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> subject in an elevated style, an elevated subject in a mean style, a first minister <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a> his wife's flouncing, or a reverend prelate in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAWN\">lawn</a> sleeves dancing a hornpipe.\n\nThe perception we have of this relation, which seems peculiar to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, cannot proceed from any other cause, but from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of congruity or propriety; for supposing us destitute of that sense, the terms would be to us unintelligible.\n\nIt is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, that congruity or propriety, wherever perceived, is agreeable; and that incongruity, or impropriety, wherever perceived, is disagreeable. The only difficulty is, to ascertain what are the particular objects that in conjunction suggest these relations; for there are many objects that do not: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, for example, viewed in conjunction with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>, or a man viewed in conjunction with a mountain, suggest not either congruity or incongruity. It seems <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to infer, what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be found true by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a>, that we never perceive congruity or incongruity but among things that are connected together by some relation; such as a man and his actions, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> and his accessories, a subject and its ornaments. We are indeed so framed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, as among things so connected, to require a certain suitableness or correspondence, termed congruity or propriety; and to be displeased when we find the opposite relation of incongruity or impropriety.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> things connected be the subject of congruity, it is reasonable before hand to expect, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of congruity should be required proportioned to the degree of the connexion. And upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> we find this to hold in fact: where the relation is intimate, as between a cause and its effect, a whole and its parts, we require the strictest congruity; but where the relation is slight, or accidental, as among things jumbled together in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, we require little or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> congruity: the strictest propriety is required in behaviour and manner of living; because a man is connected with these by the relation of cause and effect: the relation between an edifice and the ground it stands upon, is of the most intimate kind: and therefore the situation of a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> ought to be lofty; its relation to neighbouring hills, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, plains, being that of propinquity only, demands but a small share of congruity; among members of the same club, Congruity, the congruity ought to be considerable, as well as among things placed for show in the same niche: among passengers in a stage <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COACH\">coach</a>, we require very little congruity; and less still at a public spectacle.\n\nCongruity is so nearly allied to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> to be held a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of it; and yet they differ so essentially as never to coincide: beauty, like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, is placed upon a single subject; congruity upon a plurality: further, a thing beautiful in itself, may, with relation to other things, produce the strongest sense of incongruity.\n\nCongruity and propriety are commonly reckoned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a> terms; but they are distinguishable, and the precise meaning of each must be ascertained. Congruity is the genus of which propriety is a species; for we call nothing propriety, but that congruity or suitableness which ought to subsist between sensible beings and their thoughts, words, and actions.\n\nIn order to give a full view of these secondary relations, we shall trace them through some of the most considerable primary relations. The relation of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> to the whole, being extremely intimate, demands the utmost degree of congruity; even the slightest deviation is difficult.\n\nExamples of congruity and incongruity are furnished in plenty by the relation between a subject and its ornaments. A literary performance intended merely for amusement, is susceptible of much ornament, as well as a music-room or a play-house; for in gaiety, the mind hath a peculiar relish for show and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECORATION\">decoration</a>. The most gorgeous apparel, however improper in tragedy, is not unsuitable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">opera</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTORS\">actors</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> is, an opera, in its present form, is a mighty fine thing; but as it deviates from nature in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> circumstances, we look not for nature or propriety in those which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCESSORY\">accessory</a>. On the other hand, a serious and important subject admits not much ornament; nor a subject that of itself is extremely beautiful; and a subject that fills the mind with its loftiness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>, appears best in a dress altogether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>.\n\nTo a person of a mean appearance, gorgeous apparel is unsuitable; which, besides the incongruity, has a bad effect; for by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> it shows the meanness of appearance in the strongest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>. Sweetness of look and manner requires simplicity of dress, joined with the greatest elegance. A stately and majestic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> requires sumptuous apparel, which ought not to be gaudy, nor crowded with little ornaments. A woman of consummate beauty can bear to be highly adorned, and yet shows best in a plain dress:\n\nFor loveliness\nNeeds not the foreign aid of ornament,\nBut is when unadorn'd, adorn'd the most.\n\nThomson's Autumn, 208.\n\nCongruity regulates not only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of ornament, but also the kind. The ornaments that embellish a dancing room ought to be all of them gay. No picture is proper for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> but what has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> for its subject. All the ornaments upon a shield ought to relate to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>, with great judgment, confines the carvings upon the shield of \u00c6neas to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>: but this beauty is overlooked by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>; for the bulk of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>\nCongruity, ture upon the shield of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACHILLES\">Achilles</a>, is of the arts of peace in general, and of joy and festivity in particular: the author of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TELEMACHUS\">Telemachus</a> betrays the same inattention, in describing that young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a>.\n\nIn judging of propriety with regard to ornaments, we must attend, not only to the nature of the subject that is to be adorned, but also to the circumstances in which it is placed: the ornaments that are proper for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a>, will appear not altogether so decent at public worship; and the same person ought to dress differently for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> feast and for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURIAL\">burial</a>.\n\nNothing is more intimately related to a man, than his sentiments, words, and actions; and therefore we require here the strictest conformity. When we find what we thus require, we have a lively sense of propriety: when we find the contrary, our sense of impropriety is not less lively. Hence the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> distaste of affectation, which consists in making a show of greater delicacy and refinement than is suited either to the character or circumstance of the person.\n\nCongruity and propriety, wherever perceived, appear agreeable; and every agreeable object produces in the mind a pleasant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a>: incongruity and impropriety, on the other hand, are disagreeable; and of course produce painful emotions. These emotions, whether pleasant or painful, sometimes vanish without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>; but more frequently occasion other emotions, which we proceed to exemplify.\n\nWhen any flight incongruity is perceived in an accidental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of persons or things, as of passengers in a stage-coach, or of individuals dining at an ordinary; the painful emotion of incongruity, after a momentary existence, vanishes without producing any effect. But this is not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of propriety and impropriety: voluntary acts, whether words or deeds, are imputed to the author; when proper, we reward him with our esteem; when improper, we punish him with our contempt. Let us suppose, for example, a generous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> suited to the character of the author, which raises him in and in every spectator the pleasant emotion of propriety; this emotion generates in the author both self-esteem and joy; the former when he considers the relation to the action, and the latter when he considers the good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that others will entertain of him: the same emotion of propriety produceth in the spectators esteem for the author of the action; and when they think of themselves, it also produceth, by means of contrast, an emotion of humility. To discover the effects of an unfavourable action, we must invert each of these circumstances: the painful emotion of impropriety generates in the author of the action both humility and shame; the former when he considers his relation to the action, and the latter when he considers what others will think of him: the same emotion of impropriety produceth in the spectators contempt for the author of the action; and it also produceth, by means of contrast, when they think of themselves, an emotion of self-esteem. Here then are many different emotions, derived from the same action, considered in different views by different persons; a machine provided with many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>, and not a little complicated. Propriety of action, it would seem, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> favourite of nature, when such care and solicitude is bestowed upon it. It is not left to our own choice; but, like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, is required at our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>; and, like justice, is enforced by natural rewards and punishments: a man cannot, with impunity, do anything unbecoming or improper; he suffers the chastisement of contempt inflicted by others, and of shame inflicted by himself. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> so complicated, and so singular, ought to rouse our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>: for nature doth nothing in vain; and we may conclude with great certainty, that this curious branch of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> is intended for some valuable purpose.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> impropriety is punished with contempt and indignation, which are vented against the offender by corresponding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> expressions; nor is even the slightest impropriety suffered to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> without some degree of contempt. But there are improprieties, of the slightest kind, that provoke <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAUGHTER\">laughter</a>; of which we have examples without end, in the blunders and absurdities of our own species: such improprieties receive a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, as will appear by what follows. The emotions of contempt and of laughter occasioned by an impropriety of this kind, uniting intimately in the mind of the spectator, are expressed externally by a peculiar sort of laugh, termed a laugh of derision or scorn. An impropriety that thus moves not only contempt, but laughter, is distinguished by the epithet of ridiculous; and a laugh of derision or scorn is the punishment provided for it by nature. Nor ought it to escape observation, that we are so fond of inflicting this punishment, as sometimes to exert it even against creatures of an inferior species; witness a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURKEY\">turkey</a>-cock swelling with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a>, and strutting with displayed feathers; a ridiculous object, which in a gay mood is apt to provoke a laugh of derision.\n\nWe must not expect, that these different improprieties are separated by distinct boundaries; for of improprieties, from the slightest to the most gross, from the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RISIBLE\">risible</a> to the most serious, there are degrees without end. Hence it is, that in viewing some unbecoming actions, too risible for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>, and too serious for derision, the spectator feels a sort of mixed emotion, partaking both of derision and of anger; which accounts for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> with respect to the impropriety of some actions, that we know not whether to laugh or be angry.\n\nIt cannot fail to be observed, that in the case of a risible impropriety, which is always flight, the contempt we have for the offender is extremely faint, though derision, its gratification, is extremely pleasant. This disproportion between a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> and its gratification, seems not conformable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> of nature. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> about for a solution, we must reflect upon what is laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> above, that an improper action not only moves our contempt for the author, but also, by means of contrast, swells the good opinion we have of ourselves. This contributes, more than any other article, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> we have in ridiculing follies and absurdities; and accordingly, it is well known, that they who put the greatest value upon themselves are the most prone to laugh at others. Pride, which is a vivid passion, pleasant in itself, and not less so in its gratification, would singly be sufficient to account for the pleasure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a>, without borrowing any aid from contempt. Hence appears the reason of a noted observation, That we are the most disposed to ridicule the\nCongruity, the blunders and absurdities of others, when we are in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> spirits; for in high spirits, self-conceit displays itself with more than ordinary vigour.\n\nWith regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> causes of congruity and impropriety; one, regarding congruity, is pretty obvious, that the sense of congruity, as one principle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FINE_ARTS\">fine arts</a>, contributes in a remarkable degree to our entertainment. Congruity, indeed, with respect to quantity coincides with proportion: when the parts of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> are nicely adjusted to each other, it may be said indifferently, that it is agreeable by the congruity of its parts, or by the proportion of its parts. But propriety, which regards voluntary agents only, can never be the same with proportion: a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> nose is disproportional, but cannot be termed improper. In some instances, it is true, impropriety coincides with disproportion in the same subject, but never in the same respect; for example, a very little man buckled to a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOLEDO\">toledo</a>: considering the man and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> with respect to size, we perceive a disproportion; considering the sword as the choice of the man, we perceive an impropriety.\n\nThe sense of impropriety with respect to mistakes, blunders, and absurdities, is happily contrived for the good of mankind. In the spectators, it is productive of mirth and laughter, excellent recreation in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> from business. But this is a trifle in respect of what follows. It is painful to be the subject of ridicule; and to punish with ridicule the man who is guilty of an absurdity, tends to put him more upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> coming. Thus even the most innocent blunder is not committed with impunity; because, were errors licensed where they do not hurt, inattention would grow into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>, and be the occasion of much hurt.\n\nThe final cause of propriety as to moral duties, is of all the most illustrious. To have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> notion of it, the moral duties that respect others must be distinguished from those that respect ourselves. Fidelity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>, and the forbearing injury, are examples of the first sort; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a>, firmness of mind, are examples of the other: the former are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> duties by the sense of justice; the latter by the sense of propriety. Here is a final cause of the sense of propriety, that must rouse our attention. It is undoubtedly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of every man, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> his behaviour to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of his nature, and to the station allotted him by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a>; for such rational conduct contributes in every respect to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>, by preserving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, by procuring plenty, by gaining the esteem of others, and, which of all is the greatest blessing, by gaining a justly-founded self-esteem. But in a matter so essential to our well-being, even self-interest is not relied on: the powerful authority of duty is superadded to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> of interest. The God of nature, in all things essential to our happiness, hath observed one uniform method: to keep us steady in our conduct, he hath fortified us with natural laws and principles, which prevent many aberrations, that would daily happen were we totally surrendered to so fallible a guide as human reason. Propriety cannot rightly be considered in another light, than as the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> that regulates our conduct with respect to ourselves; as justice is the natural law that regulates our conduct with respect to others. We call propriety a law, not less than justice; because both are equally rules of conduct that ought to be obeyed: propriety includes this obligation; for to say an action is proper, is, in other words, to say, that it ought to be performed; and to say it is improper, is, in other words, to say that it ought to be borne. It is this very character of ought and should that makes justice a law to us; and the same character is applicable to propriety, though perhaps more faintly than to justice: but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> is in degree only, not in kind; and we ought, without hesitation or reluctance, to submit equally to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of both.\n\nBut it must, in the next place, be observed, that to the sense of propriety, as well as of justice, are annexed the sanctions of rewards and punishments; which evidently prove the one to be a law as well as the other. The satisfaction a man hath in doing his duty, joined with the esteem and good will of others, is the reward that belongs to both equally. The punishments also, though not the same, are nearly allied; and differ in degree more than in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. Disobedience to the law of justice, is punished with remorse; disobedience to the law of propriety, with shame, which is remorse in a lower degree. Every transgression of the law of justice raises indignation in the beholder; and so doth every flagrant transgression of the law of propriety. Slighter improprieties receive a milder punishment: they are always rebuked with some degree of contempt, and frequently with derision. In general, it is true, that the rewards and punishments annexed to the sense of propriety, are slighter in degree than those annexed to the sense of justice: which is wisely ordered, because duty to others is still more essential to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> than duty to ourselves; for society could not subsist a moment were individuals not protected from the headstrong and turbulent passion of their neighbours.","sp":128,"ep":130},{"h":"CONI","t":"a strong town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIEDMONT\">Piedmont</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of a territory of that name, with a good citadel.

It has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> of any great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> besides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHANNON\">Shannon</a>. It has several convenient bays and creeks, and is fertile in many places. It had several dangerous bogs, overrun with woods, which are now in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> cleared away. This province produces abundance of cattle, sheep, deer, hawks, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>; but the inhabitants being lazy, it is the least cultivated of all the four provinces. It contains 1 archbishopric, 5 bishoprics, 6 counties, 7 market-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, 8 places of trade, 10 boroughs that send members to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, 47,256 houses, 24 old castles, besides fortresses that have been erected of late, and 330 parishes. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> town is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALWAY\">Galway</a>.\n\n**Connarus, Ceylon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUMACH\">sumach</a>**. See *Botany Index*.\n\n**Connecticut**, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> river in New England, which gives name to one of the five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> of that province (see the next article). It rises in a swamp on the height of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, in N. Lat. 45\u00b0 10'. W. Long. 71\u00b0. After a sleepy course of eight or ten miles, it tumbles over four separate falls, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> west keeps <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> under the hills which form the northern boundary of the vale through which it runs. The Ammonoosuck and Iseel rivers, two principal branches of Connecticut river, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into it from the east, between the latitudes 44\u00b0 and 45\u00b0. Between the towns of Walpole on the east, and Westminister on the west side of the river, are the great falls. The whole river, comprehended between two rocks scarcely 30 feet asunder, flows with amazing rapidity into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> basin below. Over these falls, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> 160 feet in length was built in 1784, under which the highest floods may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> without detriment. This is the first bridge that was ever erected over this noble river. Above Deerfield in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASSACHUSETTS\">Massachusetts</a> it receives Deerfield river from the west, and Miller's river from the east, after which it turns westerly in a sinuous course to Fighting-falls, and a little after tumbles over Deerfield falls, which are impassable by boats. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINDSOR\">Windsor</a> in Connecticut it receives Farmington river from the west, and at Hartford meets the tide. From Hartford it passes on in a crooked course, until it falls into Long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> between Saybrook and Lyme.\n\nThe length of this river, in a straight line, is nearly 300 miles. Its general course is several degrees west of south. It is from 80 to 100 rods wide, 130 miles from...\nConnecticut from its mouth. At its mouth is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> of sand which considerably obstructs the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>. Ten feet water at full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> is found on this bar, and the same depth to Middleton. The distance of the bar from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, as the river runs, is 36 miles. Above Middleton are several shoals which stretch quite across the river. Only six feet water is found on the shoal at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> tide, and here the tide ebbs and flows but about eight inches. About three miles below Middleton the river is contracted to about 40 rods in breadth by two high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>. Almost everywhere else the banks are low, and spread into fine extensive meadows. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> floods, which generally happen in May, these meadows are covered with water. At Hartford the water sometimes rises 20 feet above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> surface of the river, and having all to pass through the above-mentioned strait, it is sometimes two or three weeks before it returns to its usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>. These floods add nothing to the depth of water on the bar at the mouth of the river; this bar lying too far off in the sound to be affected by them.\n\nOn this beautiful river, whose banks are settled almost to its source, are many pleasant, neat, well-built towns. On its western <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>, from its mouth northward, are the towns of Saybrook, Haddam, Middleton, Weathersfield, Hartford, Windsor, and Suffield, in Connecticut; West Springfield, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHAMPTON\">Northampton</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HATFIELD\">Hatfield</a>, and Deerfield, in Massachusetts; Guilford, Brattleborough, in which is Fort Dummer, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a>, Windsor, Hartford, Fairlee, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEWBURY\">Newbury</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUNSWICK\">Brunswick</a>, and many others in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VERMONT\">Vermont</a>. Crossing the river into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEW_HAMPSHIRE\">New <a class=</a>\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMPSHIRE\">Hampshire</a>, and travelling on the eastern bank, you pass through Woodbury nearly opposite to Brunswick, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHUMBERLAND\">Northumberland</a>, the Coos <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, Lyman, Orford, Lyme, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANOVER\">Hanover</a>, in which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DARTMOUTH\">Dartmouth</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a>, Lebanon, Cornish, Chesterfield, and many others in New Hampshire; Sunderland, Hadley, Springfield, Long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEADOW\">Meadow</a>, in Massachusetts; and in Connecticut, Enfield, East Windsor, East Hartford, Glastenbury, East Haddam, and Lyme.\n\nThis river is navigable to Hartford, upwards of 50 miles from its mouth, and the produce of the country for 200 miles above is brought thither in boats. The boats which are used in this business are flat-bottomed, long and narrow, for the convenience of going up stream, and of so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> a make as to be portable in carts. They are taken out of the river at three different carrying-places, all of which make 15 miles.\n\nSturgeon, salmon, and shad, are caught in plenty in their season, from the mouth of the river upwards, excepting sturgeon, which do not ascend the upper falls; besides a variety of small fish, such as pike, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARP\">carp</a>, perch, &c.\n\nFrom this river are employed three brigs of 180 tons each, in the European trade; and about 60 sail from 60 to 150 tons, in the West <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> trade; besides a few fishermen, and 40 or 50 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COASTING\">coasting</a> vessels.\n\nConnecticut, one of the five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of New England in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>; bounded on the north by Massachusetts, on the east by Rhode Island; on the south by the sound, which divides it from Long Island; and on the west by the province of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEW_YORK\">New <a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>.\n\nThe divisional line between Connecticut and Massachusetts, as settled in 1728, was found to be about 72 miles in length. The line dividing Connecticut Connecticut from Rhode Island was settled in 1728, and found to be about 45 miles. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, from the mouth of Paukatuck river, which forms a part of the eastern boundary of Connecticut, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> south-westwardly line to the mouth of Briam river, is reckoned at about 92 miles. The line between Connecticut and New York runs from latitude 41\u00b0 0' to latitude 42\u00b0 2'; 72 miles. Connecticut contains about 4,674 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles; equal to about 2,960,000 acres.\n\nThis state is watered by several fine rivers, the principal of which are, Connecticut described in the preceding article, Housatonic, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a>. One branch of the Housatonic rises in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANESBOROUGH\">Lanesborough</a>, the other in Windsor, both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERKSHIRE\">Berkshire</a> county in Massachusetts. It passes through a number of pleasant towns, and empties into the sound between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STRATFORD\">Stratford</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILFORD\">Milford</a>. It is navigable 12 miles, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DERBY\">Derby</a>. A bar of shells, at its mouth, obstructs its navigation for large vessels. In this river, between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALISBURY\">Salisbury</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANAAN\">Canaan</a>, is a cataract, where the water of the whole river, which is 150 yards wide, falls about 60 feet perpendicularly, in a perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> sheet. A copious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIST\">mist</a> arises, in which floating rainbows are seen in various places at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, exhibiting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> exceedingly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> and beautiful.\n\nThe Thames empties into Long Island sound at New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. It is navigable 14 miles, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWICH\">Norwich</a> Landing. Here it loses its name, and branches into Shetucket on the east, and Norwich or Little river on the west. The city of Norwich stands on the tongue of land between these rivers. Little river, about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> from its mouth, has a remarkable and very romantic cataract. A rock 10 or 12 feet in perpendicular height, extends quite across the channel of the river. Over this the whole river pitches, in one entire sheet, upon a bed of rocks below. Here the river is compressed into a very narrow channel between two craggy cliffs, one of which towers to a considerable height. The channel descends gradually, is very crooked, and covered with pointed rocks. Upon these the water swiftly tumbles, foaming with the most violent agitation, 15 or 20 rods, into a broad basin which spreads before it. At the bottom of the perpendicular falls, the rocks are curiously excavated by the constant pouring of the water. Some of the cavities, which are all of a circular form, are five or six feet deep. The smoothness of the water above its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>, the regularity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of the perpendicular fall, the tremendous roughness of the other, and the craggy, towering cliff which impedes the whole, present to the view of the spectator a scene indescribably delightful and majestic. On this river are some of the finest mill seats in New England, and those immediately below the falls, occupied by Lathrop's mill, are perhaps not exceeded by any in the world. Across the mouth of this river is a broad, commodious bridge, in the form of a wharf, built at a great expense.\n\nShetucket river, the other branch of the Thames, four miles from its mouth, receives Quinnabog, which has its source in Brimfield in Massachusetts; thence passing through Sturbridge and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUDLEY\">Dudley</a> in Massachusetts, it crosses into Connecticut, and divides Pomfret from Killingly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTERBURY\">Canterbury</a> from Plainfield, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a> from Preston, and then mingles with Shetucket. In passing\npassing through this hilly country, it tumbles over many falls, and affords a vast number of mill seats. The source of the Shetucket is not far from that of Quinnabog. It has the name of Willamantic while passing through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFFORD\">Stafford</a>, and between Tolland and Willington, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVENTRY\">Coventry</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANSFIELD\">Mansfield</a>. Below Windham it takes the name of Shetucket, and empties as above. These rivers are fed by numberless brooks from every part of the adjacent country. At the mouth of Shetucket is a bridge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> 124 feet in length, supported at each end by pillars, and held up in the middle by braces on the top, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a>.\n\nThe two principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a> are at New London and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEW_HAVEN\">New Haven</a>. The former opens to the south. From the light-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, which stands at the mouth of the harbour, to the town, is about three miles; the breadth is three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of a mile, and in some places more. The harbour has from five to six fathoms water, a clear bottom, tough ooze, and as far as one mile above the town is entirely secure and commodious for large ships. New Haven harbour is greatly inferior to that of New London. It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> which sets up northerly from the sound about four miles. Its entrance is about half a mile wide. It has very good anchorage, and two and an half fathoms at low water, and three fathoms and four feet at common tides. The whole of the sea coast is indented with harbours, many of which are safe and commodious, but are not sufficiently used to merit a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>.\n\nConnecticut, though subject to the extremes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> in their seasons, and to frequent sudden changes, is very healthful. As many as one in forty of the inhabitants of Connecticut, who were living in 1774, were upwards of 70 years old. From accurate calculation it is found, that about one in eight live to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 70 years and upwards; one in 13 to the age of 80 years, and one in about 30 to the age of 90.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> towns the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> is variable, according as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> blows from the sea or land. As you advance into the country, the sea breezes have less effect upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and consequently the weather is less variable. The shortest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> is 8 hours and 58 minutes, and the longest 15 hours. The north-west winds, in the winter season, are often extremely severe and piercing, occasioned by the great body of snow which lies concealed from the dissolving influence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> in the immense forests north and north-west. The clear and serene temperature of the sky, however, makes amends for the severity of the weather, and is favourable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGEVITY\">longevity</a>. Connecticut is generally broken land, made up of mountains, hills, and valleys; and is exceedingly well watered. Some small parts of it are thin and barren. It lies in the fifth and sixth northern climates, and has a strong fertile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>. Its principal productions are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> corn, rye, wheat in many parts of the state, oats and barley, which are heavy and good, and of late buck-wheat, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a> in large quantities, some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a>, potatoes of several kinds, pumpkins, turnips, peas, beans, &c., &c. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of all kinds, which are common to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>. The soil is very well calculated for pasture and mowing, which enables the farmers to feed large numbers of neat cattle and horses. Actual calculation has evinced, that any given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of the best mowing land in Connecticut, produces about twice as much clear profit as the same quantity of the best wheat land in the state of New York. Many farmers, in the eastern part of the state, have lately found their advantage in raising mules, which are carried from the ports of Norwich and New London to the West India <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, and yield a handsome profit. The beef, pork, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, and cheese, of Connecticut, are equal to any in the world.\n\nThe trade of Connecticut is principally with the French West India islands, and is carried on in vessels from 60 to 140 tons. The exports consist of horses, mules, oxen, oak staves, hoops, pine boards, oak planks, beans, Indian corn, fish, beef, pork, &c. Horses, live cattle and lumber, are permitted in the Dutch, Danish, and French ports. Beef and fish are liable to such heavy duties in the French islands, as that little profit arises to the merchant who sends them to their ports. Pork and flour are prohibited. As the ordinance making free ports in the French West India islands extends to all foreigners, the price of molasses and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> has been greatly enhanced by the English purchasers for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANADA\">Canada</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-NOVA_SCOTIA\">Nova Scotia</a>; so that the trade of Connecticut with the French West India islands is not profitable. Cotton, cocoa, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a>, and sugars, are not permitted to be brought away by Americans. The severity with which these prohibitory laws are administered is such, as that these articles cannot be smuggled.\n\nConnecticut has a large number of coasting vessels employed in carrying the produce of the state to other states.\u2014To Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, they carry pork, wheat, corn, and rye. To North and South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAROLINAS\">Carolinas</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEORGIA\">Georgia</a>, butter, cheese, salted beef, cider, apples, potatoes, hay, &c., and receive in return <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>, indigo, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>. But as New York is nearer, and the state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> always well known, much of the produce of Connecticut, especially of the western parts, is carried there; particularly pot and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEARL\">pearl</a> ashes, flax seed, beef, pork, cheese, and butter in large quantities. Much of the produce of Connecticut river, from the parts of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont, as well as of Connecticut, which are adjacent, goes to the same market. Considerable quantities of the produce of the eastern parts of the state are marketed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOSTON\">Boston</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a>.\n\nThe value of the whole exported produce and commodities from this state, before the year 1774, was then estimated at about 200,000l. lawful money annually. Since this time no accurate estimate has been made, so that it is impossible to tell whether the amount has since been increased or diminished.\n\nIn 1774, the number of shipping in Connecticut was 189; their tonnage 10,317; seafaring men 1,163; besides upwards of 20 sail of coasting vessels, which employed about 90 seamen. This state is not yet fully recovered from the confusion in which it was involved by the late war; so that the number of shipping, &c., has not, at any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> since 1774, been ascertained with accuracy. It is probable, however, considering the losses sustained by the war, the decay of the shipbuilding business, and the number of unfortunate shipwrecks,\nwrecks, and losses by hurricanes in the West Indies, that the shipping and seamen are not now so numerous as in 1774.\n\nThe number of shipping from the port of New London employed in 1788 in the European and West India trade, was four ships, one snow, 54 brigs, 32 schooners, and 45 sloops. The number of horses and cattle exported from the district round New London, from the 10th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1787, to the 10th of January 1788, was 6917; besides jackasses imported and exported, not included. From 1786 to 1787, the number was 6671; so that the last year exceeded the other 246. From <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1787 to January 1788, 1454 horses, 780 oxen, and 23 cows, were exported from the port of Middleton.\n\nThe farmers in Connecticut and their families are mostly clothed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, decent, home-spun cloth. Their flaxens and woollens are manufactured in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> way; and although they are generally of a coarser kind, they are of a stronger texture, and much more durable than those imported from France and Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. Many of their cloths are fine and handsome.\n\nIn New Haven is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> manufactory which flourishes, and one for cotton is about to be established. In East Hartford is a glaize-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, a snuff and powder mill, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>-work and flinting mill. Iron-works are established also at Salisbury, Norwich, and other parts of the state. At Stafford is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a> at which are made large quantities of hollow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WARE\">ware</a> and other ironmongery, sufficient to supply the whole state. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">Paper</a> is manufactured at Norwich, Hartford, New Haven, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LITCHFIELD\">Litchfield</a> county. Nails of every size are made in almost every town and village in Connecticut; so that considerable quantities can be exported to the neighbouring states, and at a better rate than they can be had from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. Ironmongery, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a> of the best kinds, candles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>, shoes, and boots, are manufactured in this state. We must not omit to mention wooden dishes and other wooden ware, which are made in vast quantities in Suffield and some few other places, and sold in almost every part of the eastern states. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">Oil</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a>, of a new and very ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, have been erected in several parts of the state.\n\nIt appears from experiments made formerly in this state, that a bushel of sunflower seed yields a gallon of oil; and that an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a> of ground planted with the seed at three feet apart, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> yield between forty and fifty bushels of the seed. This oil is as mild as sweet oil, and is equally agreeable with salads, and as a medicine. It may, moreover, be used with advantage in paints, varnishes, and ointments. From its being manufactured in our own country, it may always be procured and used in a fresh state. The oil is pressed from the seed in the same manner that cold drawn linseed oil is drawn from flax-seed, and with as little trouble. Sweet olive oil sells for six shillings a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUART\">quart</a>. Should the oil of the sunflower sell for only two-thirds of that price, the produce of an acre of ground, supposing it to yield only 40 bushels of the seed, will be $21, a sum far beyond the product of an acre of ground in any kind of grain. The seed is raised with very little trouble, and grows in land of moderate fertility. It may be gathered and shelled, fit for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a> of Connecticut oil, by women and children.\n\nConnecticut is divided into eight counties, viz. Hartford, New Haven, New London, Fairfield, Windham, Civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, Litchfield, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIDDLESEX\">Middlesex</a>, and Tolland. The counties are subdivided into upwards of 80 townships; each of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>, which is a corporation, invested with power to hold lands, choose their own town-officers, to make prudential laws; the penalty of transgression not to exceed 20s. and to choose their own representatives to the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>. The townships are generally divided into two or more parishes, in each of which is one or more places of public worship.\n\nConnecticut is the most populous, in proportion to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, of any of the thirteen states. It is laid out in small farms from 50 to 300 or 400 acres each, which are held by the farmers in fee-simple; and are generally cultivated as well as the nature of the soil will admit. The state is chequered with innumerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> or highways, crossing each other in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. A traveller in any of these roads, even in the most unsettled parts of the state, will seldom pass more than two or three miles without finding a house or cottage, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> under such improvements as to afford the necessaries for the support of a family. The whole state resembles a well-cultivated garden; which, with that degree of industry that is requisite for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>, produces the necessaries and conveniences of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> in great plenty.\n\nIn 1759, the number of inhabitants in Connecticut was 130,611; in 1774, there were 197,856 souls. In 18 years, the increase was 67,245; from 1774 to 1782, the increase was but 11,294 persons. This comparatively small increase of inhabitants may be satisfactorily accounted for from the destruction of the war, and the numerous emigrations to Vermont, the western parts of New Hampshire, and other states.\n\nThe inhabitants are almost entirely of English descent. There are no Dutch, French, or Germans, and very few Scotch or Irish people, in any part of New England.\n\nIn addition to what has been already said on these characters, particulars under New England, it may be observed, manners, that the people of Connecticut are remarkably fond of &c., having all their disputes, even those of the most trivial kind, settled according to law. The prevalence of this litigious spirit affords employment and support for a numerous body of lawyers. The number of actions entered annually upon the several dockets in the state, justifies the above observations. That party spirit, however, which is the bane of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> happiness, has not raged with such violence in this state as in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Public proceedings have been conducted, generally, and especially of late, with much calmness and candour. The people are well informed in regard to their rights, and judicious in the methods they adopt to secure them.\n\nThe clergy, who are numerous, and, as a body, very respectable, have hitherto preferred a kind of aristocratical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> in the very democratical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the state; which has happily operated as a check upon the overbearing spirit of republicanism. It has been lamented that the unhappy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> disputes\nConnecticut. putes which have too much prevailed among some of the clergy, and the too great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> that others have paid to their temporal concerns, to the neglect of their flocks, and an inattention to the qualifications of those who have been admitted to the sacred office, have, heretofore, considerably diminished their influence. It is a pleasing circumstance that the rage for theological disputation is abating; and greater strictness is observed in the admission of candidates to the ministry. Their influence is on the increase; and it is no doubt to be attributed, in part, to their increasing influence, that an evident reformation in the manners of the people of this state has taken place since the peace. In regard to learning and abilities, the clergy, at the present day, are equal to their predecessors at any former period.\n\nAs to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> government and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> is a separate jurisdiction, and claims authority to choose their own minister, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> government, and to enjoy gospel ordinances within itself. The churches, however, are not independent of each other; they are associated for mutual benefit and convenience. The associations have power to license candidates for the ministry, to consult for the general welfare, and to recommend <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> to be adopted by the churches, but have no authority to enforce them. When disputes arise in churches, councils are called, by the parties, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> them; but their power is only advisory. There are as many associations in the state as there are counties; and they meet twice in a year. They are all combined in one general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a>, who meet annually.\n\nAll religions that are consistent with the peace of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> are tolerated in Connecticut; and a spirit of liberality and catholicism is increasing. There are very few religious sects in this state; the bulk of the people are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGREGATIONALISTS\">Congregationalists</a>. Besides these there are Episcopalians and Baptists; and formerly there was a society of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDEMANIANS\">Sandemanians</a> at New-Haven; but they are now reduced to a very small number. The Episcopalian churches are respectable, and are under the superintendence of a bishop. There were 29 congregations of the Baptists in 1784. These congregations, with those in the neighboring states, meet in associations, by delegation, annually.\n\nThere are a great number of very pleasant towns, both maritime and inland, in Connecticut. It contains five incorporated towns or cities. Two of these, Hartford and New-Haven, are the capitals of the state. The general assembly is held at the former in May, and at the latter in October, annually. See Hartford and New-Haven.\n\nIn no part of the world is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> of all ranks of people more attended to than in Connecticut. Almost every town in the state is divided into districts, and each district has a public school kept in it a greater or less part of every year. Somewhat more than one third of the money arising from a tax on the polls and rateable estate of the inhabitants, is appropriated to the support of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>, in the several towns, for the education of children and youth. The law directs that a grammar school shall be kept in every country town throughout the state.\n\nThere is a grammar school at Hartford, and another at New-Haven, supported by a donation of Governor Hopkins. This venerable and benevolent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, in his last will, dated 1657, left in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of Theophilus Eaton, Esq.; and three others, a legacy of \u00a3324l. \"as an encouragement, in these foreign plantations, of breeding up hopeful youths both at the grammar school and college.\" In 1664, this legacy was equally divided between New-Haven and Hartford; and grammar schools were erected, which have been supported ever since.\n\nAt Greenfield there is a respectable academy, under the care and instruction of the Rev. Dr. Dwight. At Plainfield is another, under the care of the Rev. Mr. Benedict. This academy has flourished for several years, and furnished a number of students for Yale and Dartmouth colleges. At Norwich and Windham, likewise, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">academies</a> furnished with able instructors; each of these academies has 60 or 70 scholars.\n\nYale College was founded in 1700, and remained at Killingworth until 1707\u2014then at Saybrook until 1716, when it was removed and fixed at New-Haven. See New-Haven.\n\nOn the bank of Connecticut river, two miles from Middlesex, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> mine, which was wrought during periods and the war, at the expense of the state, and was productive. It is too expensive to work in time of peace. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">Copper</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> have been discovered and opened in several parts of the state, but have proved unprofitable, and are much neglected. Iron mines are numerous and productive. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">Steel</a> ore has been found in the mountains between Woodbury and New Milford. Tales of various kinds, white, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>, and chocolate coloured crystals, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a> or spelter, a semimetal, and several other fossils and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, have been found in Connecticut.\n\nAll freeholders in the state are required by law to give in lists of their polls and rateable estate, to persons appointed in the respective towns to receive them, on or before the 20th of August annually. These are valued according to law, arranged in proper order, and sent to the general assembly annually in May.\n\nThe sum total of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of the polls and rateable estate of the inhabitants of Connecticut, as brought into the general assembly in May 1787, were as follows:\n\n| Description                          | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------|\n| Sum total of the single list         | L. 1,484,001 6 4\u00bd |\n| Assessments                          | 47,790 2 9 |\n| One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the fourfolds         | 1,176 9 4 |\n| **Total**                            | L. 1,533,867 18 5\u00be |\n\nOn this sum taxes are levied, so much on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>, according to the sum proposed to be raised. A tax of two-pence on the pound would raise 12,782l. 4s.\n\nThe ordinary annual expenses of government before the war amounted to near 4,000l. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>, exclusive of that which was appropriated to the support of schools. The expenses have since increased.\n\nAt Stafford is a medicinal spring, which is said to be a sovereign remedy for scurvy, cutaneous, and other disorders. At Guilford is a spring, whose water, it is said, when separated from the fountain, will evaporate even when put into a bottle and tightly corked.\n\nIt is difficult to say what is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of this state.\nConnecticut. Contented with the form of government which originated from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> II. granted in 1662, the people have not been disposed to run the hazard of framing a new constitution since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> of independence. They have tacitly adopted their old charter as the ground of civil government, so far as it is applicable to an independent people.\n\nAgreeable to this charter, the supreme legislative authority of the state is vested in a governor, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a>-governor, twelve assistants or counsellors, and the representatives of the people, styled the General Assembly. The governor, deputy-governor, and assistants are annually chosen by the freemen in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of May. The representatives (their number not to exceed two from each town) are chosen by the freemen twice a-year, to attend the two annual sessions, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> Thursday of May and October. This assembly has power to erect judicatories, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> of causes civil and criminal, and to ordain and establish laws for settling the forms and ceremonies of government. By these laws the general assembly is divided into two branches, called the upper and lower houses. The upper house is composed of the governor, deputy-governor, and assistants; the lower house, of the representatives of the people. No law can pass without the concurrence of both houses. The judges of the superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> hold their offices during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of the general assembly. The judges of the county courts, and justices, are annually appointed. Sheriffs are appointed by the governor and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, without limitation of time. The governor is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>-general of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a>, the deputy-governor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a>-general. All other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> officers are appointed by the assembly, and commissioned by the governor.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of electing the governor, deputy-governor, assistants, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a>, and secretary, is as follows: The freemen in the several towns meet on the Monday next after the first Tuesday in April, annually, and give in their votes for the persons they choose for the said offices respectively, with their names written on a piece of paper, which are received and sealed up by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTABLE\">constable</a> in open meeting, the votes for each office by themselves, with the name of the town and office written on the outside. These votes, thus sealed, are sent to the general assembly in May, and there counted by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> from both houses. All freemen are eligible to any office in government. In choosing assistants, twenty persons are nominated, by the vote of each freeman, at the freemen's meeting for choosing representatives in September annually. These votes are sealed up, and sent to the general assembly in October, and are there counted by a committee of both houses, and the twenty persons who have the most votes stand in nomination; out of which number the twelve who have the greatest number of votes, given by the freemen at their meeting in April, are in May declared assistants in the manner above mentioned. The qualifications of freemen are, maturity in years, quiet and peaceable behaviour, a civil conversation, and freehold estate to the value of forty shillings per annum, or forty pounds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> estate in the list, certified by the select men of the town; it is necessary also that they take the oath of fidelity to the state. Their names are enrolled in the town clerk's office, and they continue freemen for life, unless disfranchised by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> of the superior court, on conviction of misdemeanor.\n\nThe courts are as follows: The justices of the peace, of whom a number are annually appointed in each town by the general assembly, have authority to hear and determine civil actions, where the demand does not exceed four pounds. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the demand exceeds forty shillings, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to the county is allowed. They have cognizance of small offences, and may punish by fine not exceeding forty shillings, or whipping not exceeding ten stripes, or fitting in the stocks. There are eight county courts in the state, held in the several counties by one judge and four justices of the quorum, who have jurisdiction of all criminal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, arising within their respective counties, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> does not extend to life, limb, or banishment. They have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> jurisdiction of all civil actions which exceed the jurisdiction of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. Either party may appeal to the superior court, if the demand exceeds twenty pounds, except on bonds or notes vouched by two witnesses.\n\nThere are several courts of probate in each county, consisting of one judge. The peculiar province of this court, is, the probate of wills, granting administration of intestate estates, ordering distribution of them, and appointing guardians for minors, &c. An appeal lies from any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> of this court to the superior court.\n\nThe superior court consists of five judges. It has authority in all criminal cases extending to life, limb, or banishment, and other high crimes and misdemeanors, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> divorces, and to hear and determine all civil actions brought by appeal from the county courts, or the court of probate, and to correct the errors of all inferior courts. This is a circuit court, and has two stated sessions in each county annually. The superior and county courts try matters of fact by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a>, or without if the parties will agree.\n\nThere is a supreme court of errors, consisting of the deputy-governor and the twelve assistants. Their sole business is to determine writs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> brought on judgments of the superior court, where the error complained of appears on the record. They have two stated sessions annually, viz. on the Tuesdays of the weeks preceding the stated sessions of the general assembly.\n\nThe county court is a court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHANCERY\">chancery</a>, empowered to hear and determine cases in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a>, where the matter in demand does not exceed one hundred pounds. The superior court has cognizance of all cases where the demand exceeds that sum. Error may be brought from the county to the superior court, and from the superior court to the supreme court of errors, on judgment in cases of equity as well as of law.\n\nThe general assembly only have power to grant pardons and reprieves, to grant commissions of bankruptcy, or protect the persons and estates of unfortunate debtors.\n\nThe common law of England, so far as it is applicable to this country, is considered as the common law of this state. The reports of adjudication in the courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENCH\">bench</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMON_PLEAS\">common pleas</a>, and chancery, are read in the courts of this state as authorities; yet the judges do not consider them as conclusively binding,\nThe feudal system of descents was never adopted in this state. All the real estate of intestates is divided equally among the children, males and females, except that the eldest son has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> portion. And all estates given in tail must be given to some person then in being, or to their immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>, and shall become fee-simple estates to the issue of the first donee in tail. The widow of an intestate is entitled to a third part of the personal estate for ever, and to her dower, or third part of the houses and lands belonging to the intestate at the time of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, during her life.\n\nThe practice of law in this state has more simplicity, but less precision, than in England. Assistants and judges are empowered to issue writs through the state, and justices through their respective counties. In these writs, the substance of the complaints or declarations must be contained; and if neither of the parties show good reason for delay, the causes are heard and determined the same term to which the writs are returnable. Few of the fictions of law, so common in the English practice, are known in this state. The plaintiff always has his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> to attach or summon the defendant. Attorneys are admitted and qualified by the county courts. Previous to their admission to the bar, they must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> two years with a practising attorney in the state, if they have had a college education, and three years if they have not; their morals must be good, and their characters unblemished; and they must sustain an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> by the attorneys of the court of the county where they are admitted, and be by them recommended to the court. When admitted to the county court, they can practise, without other qualifications, in any court in the state. There are upon an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> about thirteen attorneys to each county, one hundred and four in the state; a very great proportion for the real exigencies of the people. Yet from the litigious spirit of the citizens, the most of them find employment and support. There is no attorney general, but there is one attorney to the state in each county.\n\nThe present territory of Connecticut, at the time of the first arrival of the English, was possessed by the Pequot, the Mohegan, Podunk, and many other smaller tribes of Indians.\n\nThe Pequots were numerous and warlike. Their country extended along the seacoast from Paukatuk to Connecticut river. About the year 1630, this powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> extended their conquests over a considerable part of Connecticut, over all Long Island, and part of Narragansett. Saffacus, who was the grand monarch of the whole country, was king of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>. The seat of his dominions was at New-London; the ancient Indian name of which was Pequot.\n\nThe Mohegans were a numerous tribe, and their territory extensive. Their ancient claim, which was surveyed and settled by commissioners from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a> in 1705, comprehended all New London county, except a narrow strip of about eight miles wide, on the sea-coast, almost the whole of the county of Windham, and a part of the counties of Tolland and Hartford. Uncas, distinguished for his friendship to the English, was the sachem of this tribe.\n\nThe Podunks inhabited East Hartford, and the circumjacent country. The first sachem of this tribe, of whom the English had any knowledge was Tatanimoo. He was able to bring into the field more than 200 fighting men.\n\nThe first grant of Connecticut was made by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLYMOUTH\">Plymouth</a> council to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARWICK\">Warwick</a>, in 1630, and confirmed by his majesty in council the same year. This grant comprehended all that part of New England which lies west from Narragansett river, 120 miles on the sea-coast, from thence, in latitude and breadth aforesaid, to the South sea. The year following, the earl assigned this grant to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Say and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">Seal</a>, Lord Brook, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> others.\n\nNo English settlements were attempted in Connecticut until the year 1633, when a number of Indian traders, having purchased of Sequan and Natawante, two principal sachems, a tract of land at the mouth of Little river in Windsor, built a house and fortified it, and ever after maintained their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of soil upon the river.\n\nThe same year, a little before the arrival of the English, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of Dutch traders came to Hartford, and built a house which they called the House of Good Hope, and erected a small fort, in which they planted two cannon. The remains of this settlement are still visible on the bank of Connecticut river. This was the only settlement of the Dutch in Connecticut in these ancient times. The Dutch, and after them the province of New York, for a long time claimed as far east as the western bank of Connecticut river. It belongs to the professed historian to prove or disprove the justice of this claim. Douglas says, \"The partition line between New York and Connecticut, as established <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1, 1664, runs from the mouth of Memoroncook river, a little west from Byram river, N. N. W. and was the ancient eastern limits of New York, until November 23, 1683, when the line was run nearly the same as it is now settled.\" If Douglas is right, the New York claim could not have been well founded.\n\nIn 1634, Lord Say and Seal, &c. sent over a small number of men, who built a fort at Saybrook, and held a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> with the Pequot Indians, who in a formal manner gave to the English their right to Connecticut river and the adjacent country.\n\nIn 1635, the Plymouth council granted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a>, all lands between Narragansett and Connecticut rivers, and back into the country as far as Massachusetts south line. This covered a part of the earl of Warwick's patent, and occasioned some disputes in the colony. There were several attempts to revive the Hamilton claim, but were never prosecuted.\n\nIn October of this year, about sixty persons from Newton, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DORCHESTER\">Dorchester</a>, and Watertown, in Massachusetts, came and settled at Hartford, Wethersfield, and Windsor, in Connecticut; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> following the famous Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOOKER\">Hooker</a> and his company came and settled at Hartford, and was a friend and father to the colony to the day of his death.\n\nThe first court held in Connecticut was at Hartford, April 26, 1636.\n\nThe year 1637 was distinguished by the war with the Pequots. This warlike nation had, for some time, been troublesome neighbours. They solicited the Nar-\nConnecticut. They had surprised and killed several of the English upon Connecticut river. These threatening appearances and actual hostilities induced the three colonies of Massachusetts, Plymouth, and Connecticut, to combine their forces, to carry the war into their country, and to attempt the entire destruction of the whole tribe. Myantonomo, the Narragansett sachem, and Uncas, sachem of the Mohegans, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> to the English and offered their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to join with them against the Pequots. Forces were accordingly raised in all the colonies; but those of Connecticut, on account of their vicinity to the enemy, were first in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. Captain Mason, with 80 English and 100 Indians from Connecticut river, proceeded by water to the Narragansett country, where 200 of that tribe joined him. On the 24th of May, they began their march for Sattacus fort on Pequot, now Thames river. They afterwards determined first to assault Mystic fort, which was situated between them and Pequot river. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of the 26th of May the attack was made. The Indians, after a midnight revel, were buried in a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>. At the moment of their approach, the sentinel happened to be gone into a wigwam to light his pipe. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARKING\">barking</a> of a dog gave the alarm. The Indians awoke, raised their arrows and began their hideous yell. They were joined in their tremendous noise by the Indians in the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, who were in the rear and afraid to approach. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> was warm and bloody, and the victory complete. The fort was taken\u2014about 70 wigwams burnt\u201450 or 60 of the Indians were killed\u2014many were wounded and taken, and the rest escaped. Sattacus and his warriors at Pequot, struck with terror at the news of this defeat, demolished their principal fort, burnt their wigwams, and fled to the westward. Capt. Stoughton, with 160 men from Massachusetts, had by this time arrived at Saybrook. He with his forces joined Captain Mason and pursued the Indians, and overtook and surrounded them in a great swamp near Fairfield. A sachem and 99 women and children came out and delivered themselves up to their pursuers. Terms of peace were offered to the rest; but after a short parley they determined, that as they had lived they would die together. There were about 80 who made this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>. Part of these escaped by means of the darkness of the night. The rest were either killed or taken. In this action the Indians had guns, which is the first account of their having used them. Sattacus fled to the Mohawks, by whom it is reported he was murdered; but it is more probable that he and his company incorporated with them. Many of the Indian captives were unjustly sent to Bermuda and sold for slaves. The Pequot tribe was wholly extinguished. This successful expedition struck the Indians that remained with such terror, as restrained them from open hostilities for near forty years after.\n\nThe English thus obtained the country east of the Dutch settlements, by right of conquest. The pursuit of the Indians led to an acquaintance with the lands on the sea-coast from Saybrook to Fairfield. It was reported to be a very fine country. This favorable report induced Messrs Eaton and Hopkins, two very respectable London <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, and Mr Davenport, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of distinguished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and abilities, with their company, who arrived this year (1637) from Connecticut, to think of this part of the country as the place of their settlement. Their friends in Massachusetts, sorry to part with so valuable a company, dissuaded them from their purpose. Influenced, however, by the promising prospects which the country afforded, and flattering themselves that they should be out of the jurisdiction of a general governor, with which the country was from time to time threatened, they determined to proceed. Accordingly, in March 1638, with the consent of their friends on Connecticut river, they settled at New Haven, and laid the foundation of a flourishing colony, of which Quinnipiac, now New Haven, was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> town. The first public worship, in this new plantation, was attended on Lord's day, April 18, 1638, under a large spreading oak. The Rev. Mr Davenport preached from Mat. iii. 1, on the temptations of the wilderness. Both colonies, by voluntary compact, formed themselves into distinct commonwealths, and remained so until their union in 1665.\n\nIn 1639, the three towns on Connecticut river, already mentioned, finding themselves without the limits of any jurisdiction, formed themselves into a body politic, and agreed upon articles of civil government. These articles were the foundation of Connecticut charter, which was granted in 1662. The substance of the articles, so far as they respect the holding of assemblies, the time and manner of electing magistrates and other civil officers (except that in the old confederation no person was to be chosen governor more than once in two years), and the extent of legislative powers, was transferred into, and established in said charter.\n\nThe first church was gathered in New Haven this year, and consisted of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> members. These were chosen by the settlers after Mr Davenport had preached from the words of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a>, \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">Wisdom</a> hath builded her house, she hath hewed out her seven pillars.\" These men were indeed the pillars of the church, to whom the rest were added as they became qualified. They were also the court to try all civil actions.\n\nThe first settlers in New Haven had all things common; all purchases were made in the name and for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the whole plantation; and the lands were apportioned out to each family according to their number and original stock.\n\nAt their first election, in October 1639, Mr Theophilus Eaton was chosen governor for the first year. Their elections, by agreement, were to be annual; and the word of God their only rule in conducting the affairs of government in the plantation.\n\nIn 1643, the articles of confederation between the four New England colonies, mentioned under the article New England, were unanimously adopted by the colonies of New Haven and Connecticut.\n\nThe English settlement on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DELAWARE\">Delaware</a>, which was under the jurisdiction of New Haven, was surprized by the Swedes, and the people put in irons, under a false pretence that they were entering into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> with the Indians to extirpate the Swedes.\n\nThe general court of New Haven, this year, established it as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> article not to be disputed, That none be admitted as free burgesses but church members, and that none but such should vote at elections.\nConnecticut. They also ordained, That each town choose from among themselves judges (church members) to be a court, to have cognizance of all civil actions not exceeding twenty pounds; and of criminal causes, where the punishment was fitting in the stocks, whipping, and fining not exceeding five pounds. There was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of appeal from this to the court of magistrates. The court of magistrates consisted of all the magistrates throughout the colony, who were to meet twice a-year at New Haven, for the trial of all capital causes. Six made a quorum. The general court was to consist of the governor, deputy-governor, magistrates, and two representatives from each town. The annual election of officers of government was at this time established, and has ever since <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>.\n\nThe unsettled state of the colony had hitherto prevented their establishing a code of laws. To supply this defect, the general court ordered, 'That the judicial laws of God, as they were delivered to Moses, and as they are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FENCE\">fence</a> to the moral, being neither typical nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONIAL\">ceremonial</a>, nor having any reference to Canaan, shall be accounted of moral equity, and generally bind all offenders, and be a rule to all the courts in this jurisdiction in their proceedings against offenders, until they be branched out into particulars hereafter.'\n\nAbout this time a war broke out between the Mohegan and Narragansett Indians. A personal quarrel between Myantonomo sachem of the Narragansetts, and Uncas sachem of the Mohegans, was the foundation of the war. Myantonomo raised an army of 950 warriors, and marched towards the Mohegan country. Uncas by his spies received timely notice of their approach. His seat of residence was in some part of Norwich. He quickly collected 600 of his bravest warriors, and told them, 'The Narragansetts must not come into our town; we must meet them.' They accordingly marched about three miles to a large plain, where the two armies met, and halted within bow-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> of each other. A parley was proposed by Uncas, and agreed to by Myantonomo. The sachems met, and Uncas addressed his enemy as follows. 'You have a great many brave men; so have I. You and I have quarrelled; but these warriors, what have they done? Shall they die to avenge a private quarrel between us? No. Come like a brave man, as you pretend to be, and let us fight. If you kill me, my men shall be yours; if I kill you, your men shall be mine.' Myantonomo replied: 'My men came to fight, and they shall fight.' Uncas, like an experienced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a>, aware of the result of the conference from the superior force of his enemy, had previously signified to his men, that if Myantonomo refused to fight him in single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a>, he would immediately fall, which was to be the signal for them to begin the attack. As soon therefore as Myantonomo had finished his laconic speech, Uncas dropped; his men instantly obeyed the signal, and poured in a shower of arrows upon the unsuspecting Narragansetts, and rushing on with their horrid yells and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> fierceness, put them to flight. Many were killed on the spot, the rest were closely pursued, and some were precipitately driven <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> craggy precipices, and dashed in pieces. At a place called, from this event, Sachem's plain, Uncas overtook and seized Myantonomo by the shoulder. They sat down together; and Uncas with a hoop called in Connecticut, his men, and the battle ceased. Doubtful what to do with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> prisoner, Uncas and his warriors, in council, determined to carry him to the governor and council at Hartford, and be advised by them. Thither he was accordingly conducted. The governor having advised with his council, told Uncas, that the English were not then at war with the Narragansetts, and of course that it was not proper for them to intermeddle in the matter. Uncas was left to do with him as he pleased. Myantonomo was conducted back to the plain where he was taken, and put to death by Uncas himself. The tragic scene did not end with his death. Uncas, after the manner of the Indians, with his tomahawk cut off a large piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> from the shoulder of his slaughtered enemy, broiled and ate it, saying, with an air of savage triumph, 'It is the sweetest meat I ever ate. It makes me have a stout heart.' His body was afterwards buried, and a pillar erected over it, the remains of which are visible to this day.\n\nThe Narragansetts were greatly enraged at the death of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, and resolved to take vengeance on the Mohegans. The united colonies interposed to prevent a war between them, but in vain. The Narragansetts resolutely declared, they would continue the war until they had Uncas's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. But as Uncas had ever been a friend to the English, they joined him against his enemies, and were victorious. Such, however, was the enmity of the Narragansetts to the English, that they afterwards sent some of their men to Uncas, with large presents, to induce him to join with them in a war with the colonies. Uncas replied, 'Go tell your king, that I will go to Norwich, and advise with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> John Mafon and Mr Fitch; if they tell me to join him and fight against the English, I will join him.' In the war that happened soon after, Uncas assisted the English, and the Narragansetts were subdued, and never after were formidable.\n\nIn consideration of the success and increase of the New England colonies, and that they had been of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> to the nation, and in prospect of their being in future very serviceable to it, the English parliament, March 10, 1643, granted them an exemption from all customs, subsidies, and other duties, until further order.\n\nIn 1644, the Connecticut adventurers purchased of Mr Fenwick, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> for Lord Say and Seal, and Lord Brooke, their right to the colony of Connecticut, for \u00a3600.\n\nThe history of Connecticut is marked with traces of the same spirit which has been mentioned as characteristic of the Massachusets, in different stages of their history. Indeed, as Massachusets was the stock whence Connecticut proceeded, this is to be expected.\n\nThe colonies of Connecticut and New Haven, from their first settlement, increased rapidly; tracts of land were purchased of the Indians, and new towns settled from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAMFORD\">Stamford</a> to Stonington, and far back into the country, when, in 1661, Major John Mafon, as agent for the colony, bought of the natives all lands which had not before been purchased by particular towns, and made a public surrender of them to the colony, in the presence of the general assembly. Having done these things, the colonies petitioned King Charles II,\nfor a charter, and their petition was granted. His majesty, on the 23d of April 1662, issued his letters patent under the great seal, ordaining that the colony of Connecticut should forever hereafter be one body corporate and politic, in fact and in name, confirming to them their ancient grant and purchase, and fixing their boundaries as follows, viz. \"All that part of His Majesty's dominions in New England, in America, bounded east by Narragansett river, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called Narragansett bay, where the river falleth into the sea; and on the north by the line of Massachusetts plantation, and on the south by the sea, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> as the line of the Massachusetts colony, running from east to west, that is to say, from the said Narragansett bay on the east, to the South sea on the west part, with the islands thereunto belonging.\" This charter has ever since remained the basis of the government of Connecticut.\n\nSuch was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the Europeans respecting the geography of America, when they first assumed the right of giving away lands which the God of nature had long before given to the Indians, that their patents extended they knew not where; many of them were of doubtful construction, and very often covered each other in part, and have produced innumerable disputes and mischief in the colonies, some of which are not settled to this day. Connecticut construed her charter literally, and passing over New York, which was then in possession of the subjects of a Christian prince, claimed, in latitude and breadth mentioned therein, to the South sea. Accordingly purchases were made of the Indians, on the Delaware river, west of the western bounds of New York, and within the supposed limits of Connecticut charter, and settlements were made thereon by people from, and under the jurisdiction of Connecticut. The charter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENNSYLVANIA\">Pennsylvania</a>, granted to William Penn, in 1681, covered these settlements. This laid the foundation for a dispute, which for a long time was maintained with warmth on both sides. The matter was at last submitted to gentlemen chosen for the purpose, who decided the dispute in favour of Pennsylvania. Many, however, still assert the justice of the Connecticut claim. The state of Connecticut has lately ceded to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGRESS\">Congress</a> all their lands west of Pennsylvania, except a reserve of 20 miles square. This cession Congress have accepted, and thereby indubitably established the right of Connecticut to the reserve.\n\nThe colony of New Haven, though unconnected with the colony of Connecticut, was comprehended within the limits of their charter, and, as they concluded, within their jurisdiction. But New Haven remonstrated against their claim, and refused to unite with them until they should hear from England. It was not until the year 1665, when it was believed that the king's commissioners had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> upon the New England charters, that these two colonies formed a union, which has ever since amicably subsisted between them.\n\nIn 1672, the laws of the colony were revised, and the general court ordered them to be printed; and also, that \"every family should buy one of the law books; such as pay in silver, to have a book for 12d. such as pay in wheat, to pay a peck and a half a book; and such as pay in peas, to pay 2s. a book, the peas at 3s. the bushel.\" Perhaps it is owing to this early Connecticut and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> spread of law books, that the people of Connecticut are to this day so fond of the law. In 1750, the laws of Connecticut were again revised and published in a small folio <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of 258 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a>. Dr. Douglas observes, that they were the most natural, equitable, plain, and concise code of laws for plantations hitherto extant. There has been a revision of them since the peace, in which they were greatly and very judiciously simplified.\n\nThe years 1675 and 1676 were distinguished by the wars with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> and his Indians, and with the Narragansetts, by which the colony was thrown into great distress and confusion. The inroads of the enraged savages were marked with cruel murders, and with fire and devastation.\n\nIn 1684, the charter of Massachusetts bay and Plymouth were taken away, in consequence of Quo warrantos which had been issued against them. The charter of Connecticut would have shared the same fate had it not been for Wadsworth, Esq.; who, having very artfully procured it when it was on the point of being delivered up, buried it under an oak tree in Hartford, where it remained until all danger was over, and then was dug up and resumed.\n\nConnecticut has ever made rapid advances in population. There have been more emigrations from this than from any of the other states, and yet it is at present full of inhabitants. This increase, under the divine benediction, may be ascribed to several causes. The bulk of the inhabitants are industrious, sagacious husbandmen. Their farms furnish them with all the necessaries, most of the conveniences, and but few of the luxuries, of life. They of course are generally temperate, and, if they choose, can subsist with as much independence as is consistent with happiness. The subsistence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> is substantial, and does not depend on incidental circumstances, like that of most other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a>. There is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of serving an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPRENTICESHIP\">apprenticeship</a> to the business, nor of a large stock of money to commence it to advantage. Farmers, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> much in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARTER\">barter</a>, have less need of money than any other class of people. The ease with which a comfortable subsistence is obtained, induces the husbandman to marry young. The cultivation of his farm makes him strong and healthful. He toils cheerfully through the day\u2014eats the fruit of his own labour with a glad heart\u2014at night devoutly thanks his bounteous God for his daily blessings\u2014retires to rest, and his sleep is sweet. Such circumstances as these have greatly contributed to the amazing increase of inhabitants in this state.\n\nBesides, the people live under a free government, and have no fear of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>. There are no overgrown estates, with rich and ambitious landlords, to have an undue and pernicious influence in the election of civil officers. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">Property</a> is equally enough divided, and must continue to be so as long as estates descend as they now do. No person is prohibited from voting, or from being elected into office, on account of his poverty. He who has the most merit, not he who has the most money, is generally chosen into public office. As instances of this, it is to be observed, that many of the citizens of Connecticut, from the humble walks of life, have arisen to the first offices in the state, and filled them with\nConnection with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> and reputation. That base business of electioneering, which is so directly calculated to introduce wicked and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGNING\">designing</a> men into office, is yet but little known in Connecticut. A man who wishes to be chosen into office, acts wisely for that end, when he keeps his desires to himself.\n\nA thirst for learning prevails among all ranks of people in the state. More of the young men in Connecticut, in proportion to their numbers, receive a public education, than any of the states. Dr Franklin and other literary characters have honoured this state by saying, that it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a> of America.\n\nThe revolution, which so essentially affected the governments of most of the colonies, produced no very perceptible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in the government of Connecticut. While under the jurisdiction of Great Britain, they elected their own governors, and all subordinate civil officers, and made their own laws in the same manner and with as little control as they now do. Connecticut has ever been a republic, and perhaps as perfect and as happy a republic as has ever existed. While other states, more monarchical in their government and manners, have been under a necessity of undertaking the difficult task of altering their old, or forming new constitutions, and of changing their monarchical for republican manners, Connecticut has uninterruptedly proceeded in her old track, both as to government and manners; and by these means has avoided those convulsions which have rent other states into violent parties.","sp":160,"ep":187},{"h":"CONNECTION","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Continuity, in the drama, consists in the joining of the several scenes together.\n\nThe connection is said to be observed, when the scenes of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> succeed one another immediately, and are so joined as that the stage is never left empty.","sp":187,"ep":187},{"h":"CONNECTIVES","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">Grammar</a>, one of the four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> under which, according to Mr Harris, all words may be included.

Every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>, in this direct lineal consanguinity, constitutes a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, reckoning either upwards or downwards: the father of John Stiles is related to him in the first degree, and so likewise is his son; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> sire and grandson in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>; his great grand sire and great-grandson in the third. This is the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> way of reckoning the degrees in the direct line; and therefore universally obtains, as well in the civil and canon, as in the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>.\n\nThe doctrine of lineal consanguinity is sufficiently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> and obvious; but it is, at the first view, astonishing to consider the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of lineal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> which every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> has, within <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> very great number of degrees; and so many different bloods is a man said to contain in his veins, as he hath lineal ancestors. Of these he hath two in the first ascending degree; his own parents; he hath four in the second; the parents of his father, and the parents of his mother; he hath eight in the third, the parents of his two grandfathers; and of his two grandmothers; and by the same rule of progression, he hath 128 in the seventh; 1024 in the tenth; and at the 20th degree, or the distance of 20 generations, every man hath above a million of ancestors, as common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> demonstrate (A). This lineal consanguinity, we may observe, falls strictly within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of *vinculum personarum ab eodem filiis descendentium*; since lineal relations are such as descend one from the other, and both of course from the same common ancestor.\n\nCollateral kindred answers to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>: collateral\n\n(A) This will seem surprising to those who are unacquainted with the increasing power of progressive numbers; but is palpably evident from the following table of a geometrical progression, in which the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> is 2, and the denominator also 2: or, to speak more intelligibly, it is evident, for that each of us has two ancestors.\ncollateral relations agreeing with the lineal in this, that they descend from the same stock or ancestor; but differing in this, that they do not descend the one from the other. Collateral kinsmen, then, are such as lineally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> from one and the same ancestor, who is the first, or \"root,\" \"the fiper,\" \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a>,\" or common flock, from whence these relations are branched out. As <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> John Stiles hath two sons, who have each a numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>: both these issues are lineally descended from John Stiles as their common ancestor; and they are collateral kinsmen to each other, because they are all descended from this common ancestor, and all have a portion of his blood in their veins, which denominates them consanguineous.\n\nWe must be careful to remember, that the very being of collateral consanguinity consists in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> from one and the same common ancestor. Thus Titus and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> are related; why? because both are derived from one father: Titus and his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a> are related; why? because both descend from the same grandfather; and his second cousin's claim to consanguinity is this, that they are both derived from one and the same great-grandfather. In short, as many ancestors as a man has, so many common stocks he has from which collateral kinsmen may be derived. And as we are taught by holy writ, that there is one couple of common ancestors belonging to us all, from whom the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of mankind is descended, the obvious and undeniable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> is, that all men are in some degree related to one another. For, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a>, if we only suppose each couple of our ancestors to have left, one with another, two children; and each of those children to have left, on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a>, two more (and without such a supposition the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> must be daily diminishing); we shall find that all of us have now subsisting near 270 millions of kindred in the 13th degree, at the same distance from the several common ancestors as we ourselves are; besides those that are one or two degrees nearer to or farther from the common stock, who may amount to as many more (b). And if this calculation should appear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with the number of inhabitants on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; it is because, by intermarriages among the several descendants from the same ancestor, a hundred or a thousand modes of consanguinity may be consolidated in one person; or he may be related to us a hundred or a thousand different ways.\n\nThe method of computing these degrees in the canon law, which we have adopted, is as follows. We begin at the common ancestor, and reckon downwards; and in whatsoever degree the two persons, or the most remote of them, is distant from the common ancestor, that is the degree in which they are related to each other. Thus, Titus and his brother are related in the first degree; for from the father to each of them is counted only one: Titus and his nephew are related in the second degree; for the nephew is two degrees removed from the common ancestor, viz. his own grandfather, the father of Titus: or (to give a more illustrious instance from the English annals)\n\n| Degree | Number of Ancestors |\n|--------|---------------------|\n| 1      | 2                   |\n| 2      | 4                   |\n| 3      | 8                   |\n| 4      | 16                  |\n| 5      | 32                  |\n| 6      | 64                  |\n| 7      | 128                 |\n| 8      | 256                 |\n| 9      | 512                 |\n| 10     | 1024                |\n| 11     | 2048                |\n| 12     | 4096                |\n| 13     | 8192                |\n| 14     | 16384               |\n| 15     | 32768               |\n| 16     | 65536               |\n| 17     | 131072              |\n| 18     | 262144              |\n| 19     | 524288              |\n| 20     | 1048576             |\n\nA shorter way of finding the number of ancestors at any given degree, is by squaring the number of ancestors at half that number of degrees. Thus 16, the number of ancestors at 4 degrees, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of 4; the number of ancestors at 256 is the square of 16; 65536 of 256; and the number of ancestors at 40 degrees would be the square of 1,048,576, or upwards of a million of millions.\n\n(b) This will swell more considerably than the former calculation: for here, though the first term is but 1, the denominator is 4; that is, there is one kinsman (a brother) in the first degree, who makes, together with the propotius, the two defendants from the first couple of ancestors; and in every other degree, the number of kindred must be the quadruple of those in the degree which immediately precedes it.

Let the propotius, therefore, in the table of consanguinity, represent King Richard III and the clas marked e, King Henry VII. Now their common stock or ancestor was King Edward III, the abatus in the same table: from him to Edmund <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, the proavus, is one degree; to Richard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, the avus, two; to Richard duke of York, the pater, three; to King Richard III, the propotius, four; and from King Edward III to John of Gaunt (a) is one degree; to John earl of Somerset (b) two; to John duke of Somerset (c) three; to Margaret countess of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RICHMOND\">Richmond</a> (d) four; to King Henry VII (e) five. Which last-mentioned prince, being the farthest removed from the common stock, gives the denomination to the degree of kindred in the canon and municipal law. Though according to the computation of the civilians (who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> upwards from either of the persons related, to the common stock, and then downwards again to the other; reckoning a degree for each person both ascending and descending) these two princes were related in the ninth degree; for from King Richard III, to Richard duke of York is one degree; to Richard earl of Cambridge two; to Edmund duke of York three; to King Edward III, the common ancestor, four; to John of Gaunt five; to John earl of Somerset six; to John duke of Somerset <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a>; to Margaret countess of Richmond eight; to King Henry VII <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a>.

Thus in the tenth lineal degree, the number of ancestors is 1024; its half, or the couples, amount to 512; the number of kindred in the tenth collateral degree amounts therefore to 262144, or the square of 512. And if we will be at the trouble to recollect the state of the several families within our own knowledge, and observe how far they agree with this account; that is, whether, on an average, every man has not one brother or sister, four first-cousins, fifteen second-cousins, and so on, we shall find, that the present calculation is very far from being overcharged.\nConscience, scent in Guienne, carried by florm the town of Ber-\ngerac, and gave it up to be plundered.

Nobody is here admitted but the cardinals, whose opinions are collected, and called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>. Here are first proposed and passed all bulls for bishoprics, abbeys, &c. Hence bishopricks and abbeys are said to be consistorial benefices; in regard they must be proposed in the consistory, the annates be paid to the pope, and his bulls taken. Anciently they were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELECTIVE\">elective</a>; but by the concordat, which abolishes elections, they are appointed to be collated by the pope alone, on the nomination of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>.\n\nConsistory was also the name of a court under Constantine, where he sat in person, and heard causes: the members of this court were called comites.\n\nConsistory is also used among the reformed, for a council or assembly of ministers and elders, to regulate their affairs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>, &c.\n\nConsistory, or Court Christian, in the English laws, is a council of ecclesiastical persons, or the place of justice in an ecclesiastical or spiritual court.

The power of the lord high constable was formerly so great, and of which so improper a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> was made, that so early as the 13th of King Richard II., a statute passed for regulating and abridging the same, together with the power of the earl marshal of England; and by this statute, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEA\">plea</a> could be tried by them or their courts, that could be tried by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> law of the realm. The office of constable existed before the conquest. After the conquest, the office went with inheritance, and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENURE\">tenure</a> of the manors of Harlefield, Newman, and Whitenhurst, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLOUCESTERSHIRE\">Gloucestershire</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> serjeanty in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of the Bohuns earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEREFORD\">Hereford</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSEX\">Essex</a>, and afterwards in the line of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFFORD\">Stafford</a> as heirs-general to them; but in 1521, this great office became forfeited to the king in the person of Edward Stafford <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUCKINGHAM\">Buckingham</a>, who was that year attainted for high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a>; and in consideration of its extensive power, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> authority, both in time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> and peace, it has never been granted to any person, otherwise than by baec vice, and that to attend at a coronation, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a>. In France, the same office was also suppressed about a century after by an edict of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIII.; though it has been exercised, in the command of the Marshals, by the first officer in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>.\n\nLord high constable of Scotland was an office of great antiquity and dignity. The first upon record is Hugo de Morville in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> I. He had two grand prerogatives, viz. First, the keeping of the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, which the king, at his promotion, when he wears fealty, delivers to him naked. Hence the badge of the constable is a naked sword.\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">Second</a>, The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> and unlimited command of the king's armies while in the field, in the absence of the king; but this command does not extend to castles and garrisons. He was likewise judge of all crimes committed within two leagues of the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, which precinct was called the Chalmer of Peace; though his jurisdiction came at last to be exercised only as to crimes during the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, which some extended likewise to all general conventions. This office was conferred heritably upon the noble family of Errol, by King Robert Bruce; and with them it still remains, being expressly referred by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> of union.\n\nInferior Constables. From the great office of high constable is derived that inferior order, since called the constables of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a> and franchises; these were first ordained in the 13th year of Edward I., by the statute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINCHESTER\">Winchester</a>; which, for the conservation of the peace, and view of armour, appointed that two constables should be chosen in every hundred and franchise. These are what we now call constabularii capitales, or high constables; because continuance of time, and increase of people, &c. have occasioned others of like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, but inferior authority, in every town, called petty constables, or sub-constabularii, first instituted about the reign of Edward III.\n\nThe former, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> high constables, are appointed at the court-leets of the franchise or hundred over which they preside; or, in default of that, by the justices at their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>-leetions; and are removable by\nConstable, by the same authority that appoints them. The petty constables have two offices united in them, the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a>, and the other modern. Their ancient office is that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>-borough, tithing-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, or borstholder; which is as ancient as the time of King Alfred: their more modern office is that of constable merely; which was appointed so lately as the reign of Edward III., in order to assist the high-constable. And in general the ancient head-boroughs, tithing-men, and borstholders, were made use of to serve as petty constables; though not so generally, but that in many places they still continue distinct officers from the constables. They are all chosen by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a> at the court-leet; or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> no court-leet be held, are appointed by two justices of the peace.\n\nThe general duty of all constables, both high and petty, as well as of the other officers, is to keep the king's peace in their several districts; and to that purpose they are armed with very large powers of arresting and imprisoning, of breaking open houses, and the like: of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of which powers, conferring what manner of men are for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> put upon these offices, it is perhaps very well that they are generally kept in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>. One of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> duties arising from the statute of Winchester, which appoints them, is to keep watch and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARD\">ward</a> in their respective jurisdictions. Ward, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a>, or custodia, is chiefly intended of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>-time, in order to apprehend rioters, and robbers on the highways; the manner of doing which is left to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a> of the justices of the peace and the constable: the hundred being, however, liable for all the robberies committed therein by day-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, for having kept negligent guard. Watch is properly applicable to the night only (being called among the Saxons wach't or waftir); and it begins when ward ends, and ends when that begins: for, by the statute of Winchester, in walled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> the gates shall be closed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>-falling to sun-rising; and watch shall be kept in every borough and town, especially in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> season, to apprehend all rogues, vagabonds, and night-walkers, and make them give an account of themselves. The constable may appoint watchmen at his discretion, regulated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>; and these, being his deputies, have, for the time being, the authority of their principal.\n\nThere are also constables denominated from particular places, as constable of the Tower, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a> castle, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINDSOR\">Windsor</a> castle, of the castle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAERNARVON\">Caernarvon</a> and many other of the castles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>; whose office is the same with that of the castellani, or governors of castles.\n\nConstables of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of London is divided into 26 wards, and the wards into precincts, in each of which is a constable. They are nominated by the inhabitants of each precinct on St Thomas's day, and confirmed, or otherwise, at the court of wardmote. After <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a>, they are sworn into their offices at a court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALDERMAN\">alderman</a>, on the next Monday after Twelfth day. Such as are chosen into the office, are obliged to place the king's arms, and the arms of the city, over their doors; and if they reside in alleys, at the ends of such alleys toward the streets, to signify that a constable lives there, and that they may be the more easily found when wanted.\n\nConstables to Justices of the Peace, in Scotland, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTANCE\">Constance</a> are the proper officers for executing their orders. They have powers to suppress tumults, and to apprehend delinquents and those who can give no good account of themselves, and carry them to the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>.\n\nConstance, a strong town of Germany, in the circle of Swabia, with a bishop's see, whose bishop is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of the empire. It has a handsome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>, and several fine structures, as well sacred as profane. It carries on a great trade, and is well fortified: and though it pretends to be an imperial town, the Austrians keep a garrison here. It is famous for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> held here in 1514, when there were three popes; but they were all deposed, and Martin V. was elected in their room. The council caused Jerom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAGUE\">Prague</a> and John Hus to be burnt, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Sigismund had given them a safe conduct; in pursuance of this maxim, \"that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> is to be kept with heretics.\" They likewise condemned the doctrine of Wickliff, and ordered his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> to be burned 40 years after he was dead. However, the inhabitants now are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a>. It is seated on a lake of the same name. E. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">Long</a>. 9. 10. N. Lat. 47. 38.\n\nConstance, one of the most considerable and beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>, which separates it from Swabia, except that part where the city of Constance is seated on its side. It is divided into three parts; the upper or largest part is called Boden see, the middle Bodmer see, and the lower part Zeller see. The first is 37 miles long, and its greatest breadth 15 miles. It is deeper in summer than in winter.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTANCY\">Constancy</a>, in a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, denotes immutability, or inviability.\u2014In ethics, or when applied to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> mind, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> implies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> or steadfastness, particularly under sufferings and the trials of adversity.\n\nIt was the saying of a heathen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, That there cannot be imagined upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> a spectacle more worthy the regard of the Creator intent on his works, than a brave man superior to his sufferings. Nothing indeed can be more noble or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> than to have courage enough to execute the commands of reason and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>; to maintain the dignity of our nature, and the station assigned us; and to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> against poverty, pain, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> itself, so far as not to do anything that is scandalous or sinful to avoid them. To be thus, is to be great above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> or fortune. This argues the foul of a heavenly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a>, and is worthy the offspring of the Deity.\n\nOf this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> the following example, related in English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, is here selected, as superior perhaps, all circumstances considered, to any other upon record.\n\nSir William Askew of Kelvay, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLNSHIRE\">Lincolnshire</a>, had several daughters. His second, named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>, had received a genteel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>; which, with an agreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> and good understanding, rendered her a very proper person to be at the head of a family. Her father, regardless of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>'s inclination and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>, obliged her to marry a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> who had nothing to recommend him but his fortune, and who was a most bigotted Papist. No sooner was he convinced of his wife's regard for the doctrines of the reformation from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPERY\">popery</a>, than, by the instigation of his priests,\nConstancy, priests, he violently drove her from his house, though she had borne him two children, and her conduct was unexceptionable. Abandoned by her husband, she came up to London, in order to procure a divorce, and to make herself known to that part of the court who either professed or were favourers of Protestantism; but as Henry VIII., with consent of parliament, had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> enacted the law of the six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called the bloody statute, she was cruelly betrayed by her own husband; and, upon his information, taken into custody, and examined concerning her faith. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> above mentioned denounced death against all those who should deny the doctrine of transubstantiation; or, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> and wine made use of in the sacrament was not converted after consecration into the real body and blood of Christ; or, maintain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of receiving the sacrament in both kinds; or affirm, that it was lawful for priests to marry; that the vows of celibacy might be broken; that private masses were of no avail; and that auricular confession to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> was not necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a>. Upon these articles she was examined by the inquisitor, a priest, the lord-mayor of London, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a>; and to all their queries gave proper and pertinent answers; but not being such as they approved, she was sent back to prison, where she remained eleven days to ruminate alone on her alarming situation, and was denied the small consolation of a friendly visit. The king's council being at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a>, she was once more examined by Chancellor Wriothesley, Gardiner bishop of Winchester, Dr. Cox, and Dr. Robinson; but not being able to convince her of supposed errors, she was sent to the Tower. Mr. Strype, from an authentic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, gives us the following short account of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, which may not, perhaps, be unentertaining or useless to the reader: \"Sir Martin Bowes (lord mayor) fitting with the council, as most meet for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, and feeling her stand upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> and death, I pray you, quoth he, my lords, give me leave to talk to this woman? Leave was granted. Lord Mayor. Thou foolish woman, sayest thou that the priest cannot make the holy body of Christ? A. Askew. I say so, my lord: for I have read that God made man; but that man made God I never read; nor I suppose ever shall read it. Lord Mayor. No! Thou foolish woman, after the words of consecration, is it not the Lord's body? A. Askew. No: it is but consecrated bread, or sacramental bread. Lord Mayor. What if a mouse eat it after consecration; what shall become of this mouse? what sayest thou, thou foolish woman? A. Askew. What shall become of her, say you, my lord? Lord Mayor. I say, that the mouse is damned. A. Askew. Alack, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> mouse!\" Perceiving that some could not keep in their laughing, the council proceeded to the butchery and slaughter that they intended before they came there.\u2014It was strongly suspected that Mrs Askew was favoured by some ladies of high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>; and that she carried on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> correspondence with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>. So that the chancellor Wriothesley, hoping that he might discover something that would afford <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of impeachment against that princess, the earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol10.html#article-HERTFORD\">Hertford</a>, or his countess, who all favoured reformation, ordered her to be put to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a>; but her fortitude in suffering, and her resolution not to betray her friends, was proof against that diabolical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>. Not a groan, not a word, could be extorted from her. The chancellor, provoked with what he called her obstinacy, augmented her tortures with his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and with unheard-of violence: but her courage and constancy were invincible; and these barbarians gained nothing by their cruelties but everlasting disgrace and infamy. As soon as she was taken from the rack, she fainted away; but being recovered, she was condemned to the flames. Her bones were dislocated in such a manner, that they were forced to carry her in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> to the place of execution. While she was at the stake, letters were brought her from the lord chancellor, offering her the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> if she would recant. But she refused to look at them; telling the messenger, that \"she came not thither to deny her Lord and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">Master</a>.\" The same letters were also tendered to three other persons condemned to the same fate; and who, animated by her example, refused to accept them. Whereupon the lord-mayor commanded the fire to be kindled; and with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> ignorance cried out, Fiat justitia, \"Let justice take its course.\" The faggots being lighted, she commended her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> with the utmost composure, into the hands of her Maker; and, like the great founder of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> she professed, expired, praying for her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MURDERERS\">murderers</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 16, 1546, about the 25th year of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>.","sp":194,"ep":196},{"h":"CONSTANTIA","t":"a district at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good Hope, consisting of two farms, which produce the well-known wine so much prized in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, and known by the name of Cape <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Constantia wine.

According to M. de la Cail's account, not more than 60 fuggars of red, and 90 of the white, Constantia wine are made, each fuggar being reckoned at 600 French pints, or about 150 Swedish cans; so that the whole produce amounts to 22,500 cans. As the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> are used to keep one-third of this for themselves, the remainder is always bespoken by the Europeans <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before it is made. At the Cape this wine is seldom seen at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, partly because it is dear, and partly because it is the produce of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. The red Constantia wine sells for about 60 dollars the half a wine; but the white is usually to be purchased at a more reasonable rate. The genuine Constantia wine is undeniably a very racy and delicate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESSERT\">dessert</a> wine, and has something peculiarly agreeable in the flavour of it. That its superiority, however, is not owing to anything peculiar in the manner of preparing it, seems extremely probable; for then, without doubt, a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> more of it would be made. In fact, Dr. Sparmann informs us, that the genuine wine can only be produced from particular soils. The districts that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> next to these yield merely the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> Cape wine, notwithstanding that they have been planted with vine stocks taken from this, as well as with some brought from the banks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a>, whence it is supposed that the true Constantia first originally comes; nay, even though all the vineyards about Constantia seem to have the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>. We have instances at the Cape, as well as\nin Europe, that good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a> sometimes produce a bad wine; while, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, bad grapes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> yield a good sort of wine: therefore, towards making wine of a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, besides finer materials, there must be certain conditions and circumstances, which, by a diligent and rational <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, might probably be explored to the great benefit of mankind.\n\nSuch as are apprised in what quantities Constantia wine is consumed in Europe, will perhaps think the above calculation of the produce too limited. This, however, Dr. Sparrmann affirms us, is by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>; the overplus being the produce of avarice, which, goaded on by the desire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a>, will always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HIT\">hit</a> upon some method of satisfying the demands of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> and sensuality. The votaries of these, accustomed to be put off with empty sounds, do not seldom drink with the highest relish an imaginary Constantia, with which, however, this liquor has nothing in common besides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> name. It is therefore advisable, even at the Cape itself, to take care, that whilst one has a genuine sample given one to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, one is not made to pay for a made-up red Constantia, which otherwise is in general sold for half the price. The rich quality of this wine, is, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARROW\">Barrow</a>, owing partly to the situation and soil, and partly to the care in the manufacture; for ripe fruit only is used, and always entirely freed from the stalks.","sp":196,"ep":197},{"h":"CONSTANTINA","t":"a town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANDALUSIA\">Andalusia</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of a small territory of the same name, with a castle seated on a mountain.

At the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he transferred thither the seat of the empire; and this removal is generally thought to have been one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> causes of the sudden decline of the western empire after this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>.\n\nIn the year 332, the Sarmatians implored Constantine's affiance against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHS\">Goths</a>, who had made an irruption into their territories, and destroyed everything with fire and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>. The emperor readily granted their request, and gained a complete victory.

In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this overthrow, the Goths were obliged to sue for peace; but the ungrateful Sarmatians <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> sooner found themselves delivered from their enemies, than they turned their arms against their benefactor, and ravaged the provinces of Moesia and Thrace. The emperor, receiving intelligence of this treachery, returned with incredible expedition, cut great numbers of them in pieces, and obliged the rest to submit to what terms he was pleased to impose.\n\nConstantine seems to have been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> very highly respected, even by far distant nations. In 333, according to Eusebius, ambassadors arrived at Constantinople from the Blemyes, Indians, Ethiopians, and Persians, courting his friendship. They were received in a most obliging manner; and learning from the ambassadors of Sapor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, that there were great numbers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>'s dominions, Constantine wrote a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> in their behalf to the Persian monarch.\n\nNext year, the Sarmatians being again attacked by the Goths, found themselves obliged to set at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> and arm their slaves against them. By this means they indeed overcame the Goths; but the victorious slaves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> their arms against their masters, drove them out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. This misfortune obliged them, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of 300,000, to apply for relief to the Roman emperor, who incorporated with his legions such as were capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>; and gave settlements to the rest in Thrace, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCYTHIA\">Scythia</a>, Macedon, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>. This was the last remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of Constantine the Great. He died on May 15, 337, having divided the empire among his children and nephews, Constantine in the following manner. Constantine, his eldest son, had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>; Constantius, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>; and Constans, the youngest, Illyricum, Italy, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>. To his nearest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, Phewel Dalmatius, he gave Thrace, Macedon, and divided Achaia; and to King Annibalianus, his other nephew, son of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMENIA\">Armenia</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a>, Pontus, Cappadocia, and the city of Cesarea, which he desired might be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>.\n\nAfter the death of Constantine, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> proclaimed his three sons emperors, without any notice of his two nephews, who were soon after murdered, with Julius Constantius the late emperors <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, and all their friends and adherents, and two Thus the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of Constantine was at once reduced nephews, to his three sons, and two nephews <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALLUS\">Gallus</a> and Julian, the sons of Julius Constantius; and of these the former owed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> to a malady, from which no one thought he could recover; and the latter to his infancy, being then at most about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. The three brothers divided among themselves the dominions of the deceased princes; but did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> agree together. In 340, Constantine having in vain solicited Constans to yield <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Italy to him, raised a considerable army; and under pretence of marching to the assistance of his brother Constantius, who was then at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with the Persians, made himself master of several places in Italy. Hereupon Constans detached part of his army against him; and Constantine, being drawn into an ambuscade near Aquileia, was cut off with his whole forces. His body was thrown into the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ADRA\">Adra</a>; but being afterwards discovered, was sent to Constantinople, and interred there near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a> of his father.\n\nBy the defeat and death of his brother, Constans remained sole master of all the western part of the empire, in the quiet possession of which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till the year 350. This year Magnentius, the son of one Magnus-Magnus, a native of Germany, finding Constans deposed revolts spilted by the army on account of his indolence and inactivity, resolved to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> him, and let up for him. Having found means to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> officers of the army to his designs, he seized on the Imperial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUN\">Autun</a>, and distributed among the populace what sums he found there; which induced not only the city, but the neighbouring country, to espouse his cause. But Constans being informed of what had passed, and finding himself unable to resist the usurper, fled towards Spain. He was overtaken, however, by Gaio, whom Magnentius had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> after him with a chosen body of troops, and despatched with many wounds, at Helena, a small village situated near the foot of the Pyrenees.\n\nThus Constantius acquired a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to the whole Roman empire; though one-half of it was seized by Magnentius after the murder of Constans. The former had been engaged in a war with the Persians, in which little advantage was gained on either side; but the Persians now giving no more disturbance, the emperor marched against the usurpers in the west. Besides Magnentius, there were at that time two other pretenders to the western empire. Veteranio, general of the foot in Pannonia, had, on the first news of the empire, the death of Constans, caused himself to be proclaimed emperor by the legions under his command. He was\na native of Upper Maesia, and advanced in years when he usurped the sovereignty; but so illiterate, that he then first learned to read. The third pretender was Flavius Popilius Nepotianus, son of Europia, the sister of Constantine the Great. Having assembled a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of gladiators and men of desperate fortunes, he assumed the purple on the 3rd of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 350, and in that attire presented himself before the gates of Rome. The prefect Anicetus, who commanded there for Magnentius, fell out against him with a body of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, who were soon driven back into the city. Soon Nepotianus made himself master of the city itself, which he filled with blood and slaughter. Magnentius being informed of what had happened, sent against this new competitor his chief favourite and prime minister Marcellinus. Nepotianus received him with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>; a bloody battle ensued between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> of Magnentius and the Romans who had espoused the cause of Nepotianus; but the latter being betrayed by a senator, named Heraclitus, his men were put to flight, and he himself killed, after having enjoyed the sovereignty only 28 days. Marcellinus ordered his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> to be carried on the point of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANCE\">lance</a> through the principal streets of the city; put to death all those who had declared for him; and under pretence of preventing disturbances, commanded a general massacre of all the relations of Constantine. Soon after, Magnentius himself came to Rome, to make the necessary preparations for resisting Constantius, who was exerting himself to the utmost in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> the death of his brother. In the city he behaved most tyrannically, putting to death many persons of distinction, in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> their estates; and obliged the rest to contribute half of what they were worth towards the expense of the war. Having by this means raised great sums, he assembled a mighty army composed of Romans, Germans, Gauls, Franks, Britons, Spaniards, &c. At the same time, however, dreading the uncertain issues of war, he dispatched ambassadors to Constantius with proposals of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>. Constantius set out from Antioch about the beginning of autumn; and, passing through Constantinople, arrived at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HERACLEA\">Heraclea</a>, where he was met by the deputies from Magnentius, and others from Veteranio, who had agreed to support each other in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the emperor would hearken to no terms. The deputies of Magnentius proposed in his name a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> between him and Constantia, or rather Constantina, the sister of Constantius, and widow of Annibalianus; offering, at the same time, to Constantius the sister of Magnentius. At first the emperor would hearken to no terms; but afterwards, that he might not have to oppose two enemies at once, concluded a separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> with Veteranio, by which he agreed to take him for his partner in the empire. But when Veteranio ascended the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a> along with Constantius, the soldiers pulled him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> from thence, crying out, That they would acknowledge no other emperor than Constantius alone. On this Veteranio threw himself at the emperor's feet, and implored his mercy. Constantius received him with great kindness, and sent him to Prusa in Bithynia, where he allowed him a maintenance suitable to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>.\n\nConstantius, now master of all Illyricum, and of the army commanded by Veteranio, resolved to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> against Magnentius without delay. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, Constantine, however, on advice that the Persians were preparing to invade the eastern provinces, he married his sister Constantina to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a>-german Gallus; created him Caesar on the 15th of March; and allotted him for his share not only all the East, but likewise Thrace and Constantinople. About the same time Magnentius gave the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Caesar to his brother Decentius, whom he dispatched into Gaul to defend that country against the barbarians who had invaded it; for Constantius had not only stirred up the Franks and Saxons to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> into that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>, by promising them up the relinquished to them all the places they should conquer, but had sent them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> supplies of men and arms for that purpose. On this encouragement the barbarians invaded Gaul with a mighty army, overthrew Decentius in a pitched battle, committed everywhere dreadful ravages, and reduced the country to a most deplorable situation. In the mean time Magnentius having assembled a numerous army, left Italy, and crossing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a>, advanced into the plains of Pannonia, where Constantius, whose main strength consisted in cavalry, was waiting for him. Magnentius hearing that his competitor was encamped at a small distance, invited him by a messenger to the extensive plains of Scitia on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">Save</a>, there to decide which of them had the best title to the empire. This defeated challenge was by Constantius received with great joy; but as his troops marched towards Scitia in disorder, they fell into an ambuscade, and were put to flight with great slaughter. With this success, Magnentius was so elated, that he rejected all terms of peace, which were now offered by Constantius; but after some time, a general engagement ensued at Murfa, in which Magnentius was entirely defeated, with the loss of 24,000 men. Constantius, though victor, is said to have lost 30,000, which seems improbable. All authors however, agree, that the battle at Murfa proved fatal to this battle the western empire, and greatly contributed to its fatal speedy decline.\n\nAfter his defeat at Murfa, Magnentius retired into Italy, where he recruited his scattered forces as well as he could. But the beginning of the following year, 352, Constantius, having assembled his troops, surprised and took a strong castle on the Julian Alps, belonging to Magnentius, without the loss of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>. After this the emperor advanced in order to force the ret; upon which Magnentius was struck with such terror, that he immediately abandoned Aquileia, and ordered the troops that guarded the other passes of the Alps to follow him. Thus Constantius entering Italy without opposition, made himself master of Aquileia. From thence he advanced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAVIA\">Pavia</a>, where Magnentius gained a considerable advantage over him. Notwithstanding this loss, however, Constantius reduced the whole country bordering on the Po, and Magnentius's men deserted to him in whole troops, delivering up to him the places they had garrisoned; by which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a> was so disheartened, that he left Italy, and retired with all his forces into Gaul. Soon after this, Africa, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, and Spain, declared for Constantius; upon which Magnentius sent a senator, and after him some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, to treat of a peace; but the emperor treated the senator as a spy, and sent back the bishops without any answer.\u2014Magnentius now finding his affairs desperate,\ndesperate, and that there were no hopes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a>, recruited his army in the best manner he could, and dispatched an afflatus into the east to murder Gallus Caesar; hoping that his death would oblige the emperor to withdraw his forces from Gaul, and march in person to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the eastern provinces, which were threatened by the Persians. The afflatus gained over some of Gallus's guards; but the plot being discovered before it could be put in execution, they were all seized and executed as traitors.\n\nIn 353, the war against Magnentius was carried on with more vigour than ever, and at last happily ended by a battle fought in the Higher Dauphiny. Magnentius, being defeated, took shelter in Lyons; but the few soldiers who attended him, despairing of any further succours, resolved to purchase the emperor's favour by delivering up to him his rival, the author of so calamitous a war. Accordingly they surrounded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> where he lodged; upon which the tyrant, in despair, flew with his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> his mother, his brother Decentius whom he had created Caesar, and such of his friends and relations as were with him; and then, fixing his sword in a wall, threw himself upon it, in order to avoid a more shameful death which he had reason to apprehend.\n\nAfter the death of Magnentius, his brother Decentius Caesar, who was marching to his assistance, and had already reached <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENS\">Sens</a>, finding himself surrounded on all sides by the emperor's forces, chose rather to strangle himself than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> alive into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of his enemies. Thus Constantius was left sole master of the Roman empire. His panegyrist tells us, that after his victory he behaved with the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, forgiving and receiving into favour his greatest enemies; but other historians differ considerably from them, and tell us that Constantius now became haughty, imperious, and cruel, of which many instances are given.\n\nThis year the empire was subjected to very grievous calamities. Gaul was ravaged by the barbarians beyond the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a>, and the disbanded troops of Magnentius. At Rome, the populace rose on account of a scarcity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>. In Asia, the Iasian robbers overran Lycania and Pamphylia; and even laid siege to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SELEUCIA\">Seleucia</a>, a city of great strength; which, however, they were not able to make themselves masters of. At the same time the Saracens committed dreadful ravages in Melopotamia, the Persians also invaded the province of Anthemusa on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUPHRATES\">Euphrates</a>. But the eastern provinces were not so much harassed by the barbarians as by Gallus Caesar himself, who ought to have protected them. That prince was naturally of a cruel, haughty, and tyrannical disposition; but being elated with his successes against the Persians, he at last behaved more like a tyrant and a madman than a governor. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> cruelty is said to have been heightened by the intrigues of his wife Constantina, who is by Ammianus styled the Megera, or \"fury of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>;\" and he adds, that her ambition was equal to her cruelty. Thus all the provinces and cities in the east were filled with blood and slaughter. No man, however innocent, was sure to live or enjoy his estate a whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; for Gallus's temper being equally suspicious and cruel, those who had any private enemies took care to accuse them of crimes against the state, and with Gallus it was the same thing to be accused, convicted, and condemned. At last the emperor being informed from all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of the evil conduct of his brother-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, and being at the same time told that he aspired to the sovereignty, resolved upon his ruin. For this end he wrote letters to Gallus and Constantina, inviting them both into Italy. Though they had both sufficient reason to fear the worst, yet they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DARES\">dares</a> not venture to disobey the emperor's express command. Constantina, who was well acquainted with her brother's temper, and hoped to pacify him by her artful insinuations, set out first, leaving Gallus at Antioch; but he had scarce entered the province of Bithynia, when he was seized with a fever which put an end to her life. Gallus now despairing of being able to appease his sovereign, thought of openly revolting; but most of his friends deserted him on account of his inconsistent and cruel temper, so that he was at last obliged to submit to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of Constantius. He advanced, therefore according to his orders; but at Patavium was arrested, and stripped of all the ensigns of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>. From thence he was carried to Fianone, now Fianone, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DALMATIA\">Dalmatia</a>, where he was examined by two of his most inveterate enemies. He confessed most of the crimes laid to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>; but urged as an excuse the evil counsels of his wife Constantina. The emperor, provoked at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEA\">plea</a> which reflected on his death, filter, and inflamed by the enemies of Gallus, signed a warrant for his execution, which was performed accordingly.\n\nAll this time the emperor had been engaged in a war with the Germans: he had marched against them the German in person; and though he gained an advantage, the barbarians thought proper to make peace with him. This, however, was but short-lived. No sooner was the Roman army withdrawn, than they began to make new inroads into the empire. Against them Constantius dispatched Arbetio with the flower of the army; but he fell into an ambuscade, and was put to flight with the loss of a great number of men. This loss, however, was soon retrieved by the valour of Arinthius, who became famous in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VALENS\">Valens</a>, and of two other officers, who falling upon the Germans, without waiting the orders of their general, put them to flight, and obliged them to leave the Roman territories.\n\nThe tranquillity of the empire, which ensued on this repulse of the Germans, was soon interrupted by a pretended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a>, by which in the end a true one was produced. Sylvanus, a leading man among the Franks, commanded in Gaul, and had there performed great exploits against the barbarians. He had been raised to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> by Arbetio; but only with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to remove him from the emperor's presence, in order to accomplish his ruin, which he did in the following manner: One Dynastes, keeper of the emperor's mules, leaving Gaul, begged of Sylvanus letters Arbetio, of recommendation to his friends at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>; which being granted, the traitor eraked all but the subscription. He then inserted directions to the friends of Sylvanus for the carrying on a conspiracy; and delivering these forged letters to the prefect Lampadius, they were by him shown to the emperor. Thus Sylvanus was forced to revolt, and cause himself to be proclaimed emperor by the troops under his command.\nIn the meantime, however, Dynastes having thought proper to forge another letter, the fraud was discovered, and an inquiry set on foot, which brought to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>. Sylvanus was now declared innocent, and letters sent to him by the emperor confirming him in his post; but these were scarce gone, when certain news arrived at the court of Sylvanus having revolted, and caused himself to be proclaimed emperor. Constantius, thunderstruck at this news, dispatched against him Ursicinus, an officer of great integrity, as well as valour and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> in war; who forgetting his former character, pretended to be Sylvanus's friend, and thus found means to cut him off by treachery.\n\nThe barbarians, who had been hitherto kept quiet by the brave Sylvanus, no sooner heard of his death, than they broke into Gaul with greater fury than ever. They took and pillaged above forty cities, and among the rest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOGNE\">Cologne</a>, which they levelled with the ground. At the same time the Quadi and Sarmatians entering Pannonia, destroyed every thing with fire and sword. The Persians also, taking advantage of the absence of Ursicinus, overran, without opposition, Armenia and Mesopotamia; Probus and Maximianus, who had succeeded that brave commander in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the east, being more intent upon pillaging than defending the provinces committed to their care. Constantius not thinking it advisable to leave Italy himself, resolved at last to raise his cousin Julian, the brother of Gallus, to the dignity of Caesar. Julian seems to have been a man of very extraordinary talents; for though before this time he had been entirely buried in obscurity, and conversed only with books, no sooner was he put at the head of an army than he behaved with the same bravery, conduct, and experience, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he had been all his life bred up to the art of war. He was appointed governor of Gaul; but before he set out, Constantius gave him in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> his sister Helena, and made him many valuable presents. At the same time, however, the jealous emperor greatly limited his authority; gave him written instructions how to behave; ordered the generals who served under him to watch all his actions no less than those of the enemy; and strictly enjoined Julian himself not to give any largesse to the soldiery.\n\nJulian set out from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a> on the first of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 355, the emperor himself accompanying him as far as Pavia, from whence he pursued his journey to the Alps, attended only by 360 soldiers. On his arrival at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURIN\">Turin</a> he was first acquainted with the loss of Cologne, which had been kept concealed from the emperor. He arrived at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VIENNE\">Vienne</a> before the end of the year, and was received by the people of that city and the neighbourhood with extraordinary joy.\n\nIn 356, the barbarians besieged Autun; to relieve which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, Julian marched with what forces he could raise. When he came there, he found the siege raised; on which he went in pursuit of the barbarians to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUXERRE\">Auxerre</a>, crossing with no small danger thick woods and forests, from Auxerre to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TROYES\">Troyes</a>. On his march he was surrounded on all sides by the barbarians, who moved about the country in great bodies; but he put them to flight with a handful of men, cut great numbers of them in pieces, and took some prisoners. From Troyes he hastened to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHEIMS\">Rheims</a>, where the main body of the army, commanded by Marcellus, waited his arrival. Leaving Rheims, he took his route towards Decempagii, now Dieuze, on the Seille in Lorraine, with a design to oppose the Germans who were busy in ravaging that province. But the enemy attacking his rear unexpectedly, would have cut off two legions, had not the rest of the army, alarmed at the sudden noise, turned back to their assistance. A few days afterwards he defeated the Germans, though with great loss to his own army; the victory, however, opened him a way to Cologne. This city he found abandoned by the barbarians. They had neglected to fortify it; but Julian commanded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> fortifications to be repaired with all possible expedition, and the houses to be rebuilt; after which he retired to Sens, and there took up his winter-quarters. This year also Constantius entered Germany on the side of Rhaetia, laid waste the country far and wide; and obliged the barbarians to sue for peace, which was readily granted. The same year he enacted two laws; by one of which it was declared capital to sacrifice, or pay any kind of worship, to idols; the other, granting the effects of condemned persons to belong to their children and relations within the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, except in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGIC\">magic</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a>; but this last one he revoked two years after.\n\nIn the beginning of the year 357, the barbarians besieged Julian a whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> in Sens; Marcellus, the commander in chief, never once offering to assist him. Julian, however, so valiantly defended himself with the few forces he had, that the barbarians at last retired. After this, Constantius declared Julian commander in chief of all the forces in Gaul; appointing under him one Severus, an officer of great experience, and of a quite different disposition from Marcellus. On his arrival in Gaul, Julian received him with great joy, raised new troops, and supplied them with arms which he luckily found in an old arsenal. The emperor, resolving at all events to put a stop to the terrible devastations committed by the barbarous nations, chiefly by the Alemans, wrote to Julian to march directly against them. At the same time he sent Barbatio, who had been appointed general in place of Sylvanus, with a body of 25 or 30,000 men, out of Italy, in order to inclose the enemy between two armies. The Leti, however, a German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, passing between the armies, advanced as far as Lyons, hoping to surprise that wealthy city; but meeting with a warmer reception than they expected, contented themselves with ravaging the country all round it. On the first notice of this expedition, Julian detached strong parties to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> the passes through which he knew the barbarians must return. Thus they were all cut off except those who marched near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a> of Barbatio; cut off by Julian, who was so far from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> off their retreat, that he complained by a letter to Constantius of some officers for attempting it. These officers, among whom was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VALENTINIAN\">Valentinian</a> afterwards emperor of the west, were by the orders of Constantius, cashiered for their disobedience. The other barbarians either fortified themselves in the countries which they had seized, stopping up all the avenues with huge trees, or took shelter in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> formed by the Rhine. Julian resolved first to attack the latter; and with this view demanded some boats of Barbatio; but he, instead of complying...\ncomplying with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> request, immediately burnt all his boats, as he did on another occasion the provisions which had been sent to both armies, after he had plentifully supplied his own. Julian, not in the least disheartened with this unaccountable conduct, persuaded some of the most resolute of his men to wade over to one of the islands. Here they killed all the Germans who had taken shelter in it. They then seized their boats, and pursued the slaughter in several other islands, till the enemy abandoned them all, and retired to their respective countries with their wives and what booty they could carry. On their departure, Barbatio attempted to lay a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> of boats over the Rhine; but the enemy, apprised of his intention, threw a great number of huge trees into the river, which being carried by the stream against the boats, sunk several of them, and parted the rest. The Roman general then thought proper to retire; but the barbarians falling unexpectedly upon him in his retreat, cut great numbers of his men in pieces, took most of his baggage, laid waste the neighbouring country, and returned in triumph loaded with booty. Elevated with this success, they assembled in great numbers under the command of Chnodomarius, a prince of great renown among them, and six other kings. They encamped in the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STRASBOURG\">Strasbourg</a>. Here they were encountered by Julian; who put them to flight, with the loss of 6000 or 8000 of their men slain in the field, and a vastly greater number drowned in the river; while Julian himself lost only 243 private men and four tribunes. In this action Chnodomarius was taken, and sent to Rome, where he soon after died.\n\nAfter the battle, Julian advanced with all his army to Mayence, where he built a bridge over the Rhine and entered Germany, having with difficulty prevailed upon his army to follow him. Here he ravaged the country till the time of the autumnal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUINOX\">equinox</a>, when being prevented by snow from advancing any further, he began to repair the fort of Trajan, by some supposed to be the castle of Cromburgh, about three or four leagues from Frankfort. The barbarians were now so much alarmed, that they sent deputies to treat of a peace; but this Julian refused to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> them upon any terms. He consented, however, to a truce for seven months, upon their promising to store with provisions the fort he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> in their country. This year Constantius made some remarkable laws. By one he punished with confiscation such as renounced the Christian for the Jewish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>; and by another, addressed to Felix bishop of Rome, he exempted all merchandising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a>, with their wives, children, and domestics, from every imposition ordinary and extraordinary: supposing the gains they made to be applied by them to the relief of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>.\n\nIn 358, as soon as the season was fit for action, Julian took the field against the Franks, with a design to conquer them before the truce he had concluded with the Alemans was expired. The Franks were at that time divided into several tribes, the most powerful of which were the Salii and Chamavi. The first of these sent deputies, intreating that he would suffer them to remain as friends to the empire in the country they possessed. But Julian, without paying any regard to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPUTATION\">deputation</a>, entered their country, and obliged them to submit; after which he allotted them lands in Gaul, incorporating great numbers of them into his cavalry. He next marched against the Chamavi, whom he defeated and obliged to retire beyond the Rhine. Afterwards he rebuilt three forts on the river Meuse, which had been destroyed by the barbarians; but wanting provisions in a country so often ravaged, he ordered 600 or 800 vessels to be built in Britain for the conveying corn from thence into Gaul. Julian continued in the country of the Chamavi till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> of his truce with the Alemans; and then laying a bridge of boats over the Rhine, he entered their country, putting all to fire and sword. At last two of their kings came in person to him to sue for peace; which Julian granted, upon their promising to let at liberty the captives they had taken; to supply a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of corn when required; and to furnish wood, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a>, for repairing the cities they had ruined. The prisoners whom he at this time released, amounted to upwards of 20,000.\n\nSoon after the vernal equinox of this year 358, Constantius marched in person against the Quadi and Sarmatians, whose country lay beyond the Danube. Having crossed that river on a bridge of boats, he laid waste the territories of the Sarmatians; who thereupon came in great numbers, together with the Quadi, pretending to sue for peace. Their true design was to surprise the Romans; but the latter supposing it, fell upon them sword in hand, and cut them all in pieces. This obliged the rest to sue for peace in good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a>, which was granted on the delivery of hostages. The emperor then marched against the Limitantes, that is, the slaves who, in 334, had driven the Sarmatians out of their country, and feasted it for themselves*. They used the same artifice as the Sarmatians and Quadi had done, coming in great numbers under pretence of submitting, but prepared to fall upon him unexpectedly if opportunity offered. The emperor, observing their fury looks, and distrusting them, caused his troops surround them infensibly while he was speaking. The Limitantes then displeased with the conditions he offered them, laid their hands on their swords: on which they were attacked by the Roman soldiers. Finding it impossible to make their escape, they made with great fury towards the tribunal, but were repelled by the guards forming themselves into a wedge, and every one of them cut in pieces. After this, the emperor ravaged their country to such a degree, that they were the Limitantes in the end obliged to submit to the only condition he ganted, thought proper to allow them, which was to quit their country, and retire to a more distant place. The country was then restored to the Sarmatians, who were its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> possessors.\n\nThis year is also remarkable for a very haughty embassy from Sapor king of Persia. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a>, named Narfes, brought a letter, in which the Persian monarch styled himself \"king of kings, brother of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>,\" &c. He acquainted the emperor, that he might lawfully insist on having all the countries beyond the river Strymon in Macedon delivered up to him; but lest his demands should seem unreasonable, he would be contented with Armenia and Mesopotamia, which had been most unjustly taken from his grandfather Narfes. He added, that unless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> was done him, he was resolved to assert his right\nright by force of arms. This letter was presented to Constantius wrapped up in a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>; but he, without entering into any negociation with the ambassador, wrote a letter to Sapor, in which he told him, that as he had maintained the Roman dominions in their full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, when he was possessed only of the east, he could not suffer them to be curtailed now when he was master of the whole empire. In a few days, however, he sent another letter, with rich presents; being very desirous at least to put off the war till he had secured the northern provinces against the incursions of the barbarians, that he might then employ all the forces of the empire against so formidable an enemy. This embassy proved unsuccessful, as did also another which was sent soon after. The last ambassadors were imprisoned as spies, but afterwards dismissed unhurt. By a law of Constantius dated in 358, all magicians, augurs, astrologers, and pretenders to the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINATION\">divination</a>, were declared enemies to mankind; and such of them as were found in the court either of the emperor or of Julian, he commanded to be put to the torture, and specified what torments they were to undergo.\n\nIn 359, Julian continued his endeavours for relieving the province of Gaul, which had suffered so much from the incursions of the barbarians. He erected magazines in different places, visited the cities which had suffered most, and gave orders for repairing their walls and fortifications properly. He then crossed the Rhine, and pursued the war in Germany with great success, insomuch that the barbarians submitted to such terms as he pleased to impose. In the mean time, the emperor, having received intelligence that the Limitantes had quitted the country in which he had placed them, hastened to the banks of the Danube, in order to prevent their entering Pannonia. On his arrival he sent deputies, desiring to know what had induced them to abandon the country which had been allotted them. The Limitantes answered, in appearance with the greatest submission imaginable, that they were willing to live as true subjects of the empire in any other place; but that the country he had allotted them was quite uninhabitable, as they could demonstrate if they were but allowed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> the river, and lay their complaints before him. This request was granted; but while he ascended his tribunal, the barbarians unexpectedly fell upon his guards sword in hand, killed several of them, and the emperor with difficulty saved himself by flight. The rest of the troops, however, soon took the alarm, and surrounding the Limitantes, cut them all off to a man. This year Constantius instituted a court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INQUISITION\">inquisition</a> against all those who consulted heathen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORACLES\">oracles</a>. Paulus Catena, a noted and cruel informer, was dispatched into the east to prosecute them; and Modestus, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> of the east, and equally remarkable for his cruelty, was appointed judge. His tribunal was erected at Scythopolis in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a>, whither persons of both sexes, and of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and condition, were daily dragged in crowds from all parts, and either confined in dungeons, or torn in pieces in a most cruel and barbarous manner by racks, or publicly executed.\n\nIn 359, Sapor king of Persia began hostilities, being encouraged thereto by the absence of Ursicinus, whom the emperor had recalled, and appointed in his room one Sabinianus, a person very unfit for such an office. During this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a>, however, he made very little progress; having only taken two Roman forts, and destroyed the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMIDA\">Amida</a>, the siege of which is said to have cost him 30,000 men. On the first news of the Persian invasion, Constantius had thought proper to send Ursicinus into the east; but his enemies prevented him from receiving the supplies necessary for carrying on the war; so that he found it impossible to take any effectual means for stopping the progress of the Persians. On his return, he was unexpectedly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with the loss of Amida, and all the disasters that had happened during the campaign. Two judges were appointed to inquire into his conduct; but they, being creatures of his enemies, left the matter doubtful. On this Ursicinus was so much exasperated, that he appealed to the emperor, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> let fall some unguarded expressions, which being immediately carried to the emperor, the general was deprived of all his employments.\n\nConstantius resolved to march next year in person against the Persians; but in the meantime, dreading to encounter so formidable an enemy, he applied himself wholly to the assembling of a mighty army, by which he might be able fully to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPE\">cope</a> with them. For this purpose he wrote to Julian to send him part of his forces, without considering that by so doing he left the province of Gaul exposed to the ravages of the barbarians. Julian resolved immediately to comply with the emperor's orders; but at the same time to abdicate the dignity of Caesar, that he might not be blamed for the loss of the province. Accordingly he suffered the best soldiers to be drafted out of his army. They were, however, very unwilling to leave Julian, and at last proclaimed him emperor. Whether this was done absolutely against Julian's consent or not is uncertain; but he wrote to the emperor, and persuaded the whole army also to send a letter along with his, in which they acquainted Constantius with what had happened, and entreated him to acknowledge Julian as his partner in the empire. But this was positively refused by Constantius, who began to prepare for war. Julian then, desiring to be beforehand with the emperor, caused his troops take an oath of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> to himself, and with surprising expedition made himself master of the whole country of Illyricum, and the important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> separating that country from Thrace. Constantius was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>-struck with this news; but hearing that the Persians had retired, he marched with all his force against his competitor. On his arrival at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TARSUS\">Tarsus</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CILICIA\">Cilicia</a>, he was seized with a feverish distemper, occasioned chiefly by the uneasiness and perplexity of his mind. He pursued his march, however, to Moplucrene, a place on the borders of Cilicia, at the marches afoot of Mount Taurus. Here he was obliged to stop against him, by the violence of his disorder, which increased every day, and at last carried him off on the 13th of November 361, in the 45th year of his age.\n\nBy the death of Constantius, Julian now became master of the whole Roman empire without a rival. He had been educated in the Christian religion; but he secretly apostatized from it long before, and as soon as he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> himself master of Illyricum, openly avowed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOSTASY\">apostasy</a>, and caused the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> of the gods to be opened.\nWhen the messengers arrived at Naissus in Illyricum, where he then was, to acquaint him with his being sole master of the empire, they found him consulting the entrails of victims concerning the event of his journey. As the omens were uncertain, he was at that time very much embarrassed and perplexed; but the arrival of the messengers put an end to all his fears, and he immediately set out for Constantinople. At Heraclea he was met by almost all the inhabitants of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>, into which he made his public entry on the 11th of December 364, being attended by the whole senate in a body, by all the magistrates, and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> magnificently dressed, every one testifying the utmost joy at seeing such a promising young prince raised to the empire without bloodshed. He was again declared emperor by the senate of Constantinople; and as soon as that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> was over, he caused the obsequies of Constantius to be performed with great pomp.\n\nThe first care of Julian was to inquire into the conduct of the late emperor's ministers. Several of these having been found guilty of enormous crimes, were condemned and executed; particularly the noted informer Paulus Catena, and another named Apodamus, were sentenced to be burnt alive. Along with these, however, was put to death one Ursula, a man of unexceptionable character, and to whom Julian himself was highly indebted. He had been supplied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> by Ursula, unknown to the emperor, at the time when he was sent into Gaul with the title of Caesar, but without the money necessary for the support of that dignity. For what reason he was now put to death, historians do not acquaint us. Julian himself tells us, that he was executed without his knowledge.\n\nThe emperor next set about reforming the court. As the vast number of offices was in his time become an intolerable burden, he discharged all those whom he thought useless. He reduced, among the rest, the officers called *agentes in rebus*, from 10,000 to 17; and discharged thousands of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-COOKS\">cooks</a>, barbers, &c., who by their large salaries drained the exchequer. The *curiatus*, whose office it was to inform the emperor of what had passed in the different provinces, were all discharged, and that employment entirely suppressed. Thus he was enabled to ease the people of the heavy taxes with which they were loaded; and this he did by abating a fifth part of all taxes and imposts throughout the kingdom.\n\nAs to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> matters, Julian, as before observed, was a Pagan, and immediately on his accession to the throne restored the heathen religion. He invited to court the philosophers, magicians, &c., from all parts; nevertheless, he did not raise any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a> against the Christians. On the contrary, he recalled from banishment all the orthodox bishops who had been sent into exile during the former reign; but with a design, as is observed both by the Christian and Pagan writers, to raise disturbances and sow dissensions in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>.\n\nAs the Persians were now preparing to carry on the war with vigour, Julian found himself under a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of marching against them in person. But before he set out, he enriched the city of Constantinople with many valuable gifts. He formed a large harbour to shelter the ships from the south <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, built a magnificent porch leading to it, and in another porch a stately library, in which he lodged all his books. In the month of May, A.D. 362, he set out for Antioch; and on the first of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> renewed in that city the sacrifices to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> for the safety of the empire, which had been so long omitted. During his stay in this city, he continued his preparations for the Persian war, erecting magazines, making new levies, and above all conferring the oracles, aruspices, magicians, &c. The oracles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DELPHI\">Delphi</a>, Delos, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DODONA\">Dodona</a>, assured him of victory. The aruspices, indeed, and most of his courtiers and officers, did all that lay in their power to divert him from his intended expedition; but the deceitful answers of the oracles and magicians, and the desire of adding the Persian monarch to the many kings he had already seen humbled at his feet, prevailed over all other considerations. Many nations sent deputies to him offering their assistance; but these offers he rejected, telling them that the Romans were to afflict their allies, but stood in no need of any assistance from them. He likewise rejected, and in a very disfavouring manner, the offers of the Saracens; answering them, when they complained of his stopping the pension paid them by other emperors, that a warlike prince had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>, but no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>; which they refusing, joined the Persians, and continued faithful to them to the last. However, he wrote to Arlaces king of Armenia, enjoining him to keep his troops in readiness to execute the orders he should soon transmit to him.\n\nHaving made the necessary preparations for so important an enterprise, Julian sent orders to his troops Euphrates, to cross the Euphrates, desiring to enter the enemy's country before they had the least notice of his march; for which purpose he had placed guards on all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>. From Antioch he proceeded to Litarba, a place about 15 leagues distant, which he reached the same day. From thence he went to Berea, where he halted a day, and exhorted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> to restore the worship of the gods; but this exhortation, it seems, was complied with but by few. From Berea he proceeded to Batnae; and was better pleased with the inhabitants of the latter, because they had, before his arrival, restored the worship of the gods. There he offered sacrifices; and having immolated a great number of victims, he pursued the next day his journey to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIERAPOLIS\">Hierapolis</a>, the capital of the province of Euphrateisana, which he reached on the 9th of March. Here he lodged in the house of one for whom he had a particular esteem, chiefly because neither Constantius nor Gallus, who had both lodged in his house, had been able to make him renounce the worship of his idols. As he entered this city, 50 of his soldiers were killed by the fall of a porch. He left Hierapolis on the 13th of March; and having passed the Euphrates on a bridge of boats, came to Batnae a small city of Osroene, about 10 leagues from Hierapolis; and here 50 more of his soldiers were killed by the fall of a stack of straw. From Batnae he proceeded to Carrhae; where, in the famous temple of the moon, it is said he sacrificed a woman to that planet.\n\nWhile Julian continued in this city, he received advice that a party of the enemies' <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> had broken into the Roman territories. On this he resolved to leave an army in Mesopotamia, to guard the frontiers of the empire.\nConstantine's empire on that side, while he advanced on the other into the heart of the Persian dominions. This army consisted, according to some, of 20,000, according to others, of 30,000 chosen troops. It was commanded by Procopius and Sebastian a famous Manichean who had been governor of Egypt, and had persecuted there, with the utmost cruelty, the orthodox Christians. These two were to join, if possible, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARSACES\">Arsaces</a> king of Armenia, to lay waste the fruitful plains of Media, and meet the emperor in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSYRIA\">Assyria</a>. To Arsaces Julian himself wrote, but in the most disobliging manner imaginable, threatening to treat him as a rebel if he did not execute, with the utmost punctuality, the orders given him; and at the conclusion told him, that the God he adored would not be able to free him from his indignation.\n\nThere were two roads leading from Carrhae to Persia; the one to the left by Nisibis; the other to the right through the province of Assyria, along the banks of the Euphrates. Julian chose the latter, but caused magazines to be erected on both roads; and, after having viewed his army, set out on the 26th of March. He passed the Abora, which separated the Roman and Persian dominions, near its confluence with the Euphrates; after which he broke down the bridge, that his troops might not be tempted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a>, fearing they could not return home. As he proceeded on his march, a soldier and two horses were struck dead by a flash of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>; and a lion of an extraordinary size presenting himself to the army, was in a moment dispatched by the soldiers with a shower of darts. These omens occasioned great disputes between the philosophers and astrologers; the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> upon them as inauspicious, advised the emperor to return; but the former refuted their arguments with others more agreeable to Julian's temper.\n\nHaving passed the Abora, Julian entered Assyria, which he found very populous, and abounding with all the necessaries of life; but he laid it waste far and near, destroying the magazines and provisions which he could not carry along with him; and thus he put it out of his power to return the same way he came; a step which was judged very impolitic. As he met with no army in the field to oppose him, he advanced to the walls of Ctesiphon, the metropolis of the Persian empire; having reduced all the strong holds that lay in his way. Here, having caused the canal to be cleared, which was formerly dug by Trajan between these two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, he conveyed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> from the former to the latter. On the banks of the Tigris he was opposed by the enemy. But Julian passed that river in spite of their utmost efforts, and drove them into the city with the loss of a great number of their men, himself, in the mean time, losing only 70 or 75.\n\nJulian had now advanced so far into the enemy's country, that he found it necessary to think of a retreat, as it was impossible for him to winter in Persia. For this reason he made no attempt on Ctesiphon, but began to march back along the banks of the Tigris, soon after he had passed that river. In the meantime the king of Persia was assembling a formidable army, with a design to fall upon the Romans in their march; but being desirous of putting an end to so destructive a war, he sent very advantageous proposals of peace to Julian. These the Roman emperor very imprudently rejected; and soon after, deceived by treacherous guides, he quitted the river, and entered into an unknown country totally laid waste by the enemy; and where he was continually harassed by strong parties, who in a manner surrounded his army, and attacked him sometimes in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a>, and sometimes in the rear. A still worse step he was persuaded to take by the treacherous guides already mentioned: and this was to burn his fleet, lest it should fall into the hands of the enemy. As soon as the fleet was set on fire, the whole army cried out, that the emperor was betrayed, and that the guides were traitors employed by the enemy. Julian ordered them immediately to be put to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a>, upon which they confessed the treason; but it was too late. The fleet was already in flames; they could by no means be extinguished; and no part was saved except 12 vessels, which were designed to be made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of in the building of bridges, and for this purpose were conveyed over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> in wagons.\n\nThe emperor thus finding himself in a strange country, and his army greatly dispirited, called a council of his chief officers, in which it was resolved to proceed to Corduene, which lay south of Armenia, and belonged to the Romans. With this view, they had not proceeded far when they were met by the king of Persia, at the head of a very numerous army, attended by his two sons, and all the principal nobility of the kingdom. Several sharp encounters happened, in which, though the Persians were always defeated, yet the Romans reaped no advantages from their victories, but were reduced to the last extremity for want of provisions. In one of these skirmishes, when the Romans were suddenly attacked, the emperor, eager to repulse the enemy, hastened to the field of battle, in a sudden attack by a dart, which, through his arm and side, pierced his very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a>. Of this wound he died the same night, the 26th of June 363, in the 32nd year of his age, after having reigned scarce 20 months from the time he became sole master of the Roman empire.\n\nAs Julian had declined naming any successor, the Jovian choice of a new emperor devolved on the army. They raised to the throne Jovian, a very able commander, whose father had lately resigned the post of comes domesticorum, in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> a retired life. The valour and experience of Jovian, however, were not sufficient to extricate the Roman army from the difficulties in which they had been plunged by the imprudence of his predecessor. The famine raged in the camp to such a degree, that not a single man would have been left alive, had not the Persians unexpectedly sent proposals of peace. These were now received with the utmost joy. A peace was concluded for 30 years; the terms of which were, that Jovian should send to the Persians the five provinces which had been taken from them in the reign of Diocletian, with several castles, and the cities of Nisibis and Singara. After the conclusion of the treaty, Jovian pursued his march without molestation. When he arrived at Antioch, he revoked all the laws that had been made in the former reign against Christianity and in favour of Paganism. He eloped also the cause of the orthodox Christians against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARIANS\">Arians</a>; and recalled all those who had been formerly banished, particularly Athanasius.\nConstatinopelian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>.\n\nHis death.\n\nValentinian chosen emperor, chooses Valens for his partner.\n\nProcopius revolts.\n\nWar with the Goths.\n\nThe Goths, having been solicited by Procopius, had sent 3000 men to his assistance. On hearing the news of the usurper's death, they marched back; but Valens detached against them a body of troops, who took them all prisoners notwithstanding the vigorous resistance they made. Athanaric, king of the Goths, expostulated on this proceeding with Valens; but that emperor proving obstinate, both parties prepared for war. In 367 and 369, Valens gained great advantages over his enemies; and obliged them to sue for peace, which was concluded upon terms very advantageous to the Romans. The rest of this reign contains nothing remarkable, except the cruelty with which Valens persecuted the orthodox clergy. The latter sent 80 of their number to him, in order to lay their complaints before him; but he, instead of giving them any relief, determined to put them all to death. But the person who was ordered to execute this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>, fearing lest the public execution of so many ecclesiastics might raise disturbances, ordered them all to be put on board a ship, Eighty orthodox ecclesiastics pretending that the emperor had ordered them only to be lent into banishment; but when the vessel was put to some distance from land, the mariners set fire to it, and made their own escape in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>. The ship was driven by a strong wind into a harbour, where it was consumed and all that were in it. A persecution was also commenced against magicians, or those who had books of magic in their custody. This occasioned the destruction of many innocent persons; for books of this kind were often conveyed into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LIBRARIES\">libraries</a> unknown to the owners of them, and this was certainly followed by death and confiscation of goods. Hereupon persons of all ranks were seized with such terror that they burnt their libraries, lest books of magic should have been secretly conveyed among the others. In 378, the Goths, whom Valens had admitted into Thrace, advanced from that province to Macedon and Thessaly, where they committed dreadful ravages. They afterwards blocked up the city of Constantinople, plundered the suburbs, and at last totally defeated and killed the emperor himself. The day after the battle, hearing that an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> was lodged in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADRIANOPLE\">Adrianople</a>, the barbarians laid siege to that place; but being quite strangers to the art of besieging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, they were repulsed with great slaughter; upon which they dropped that enterprise, and returned before Constantinople. But here great numbers of them were cut in pieces by the Saracens, whom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARIA\">Maria</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> had sent to the assistance of the Romans; so that they were obliged to abandon this design likewise, and retire from the neighbourhood of that city.\n\nBy the death of Valens, the empire once more fell into the hands of a single person. This was Gratian, who had held the empire of the West after the death of Valentinian. He repelled many barbarous nations who threatened the empire at that time with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a>; but finding himself pressed on all sides, he soon resolved to take a colleague, in order to ease him of some part of the burden. Accordingly, on the 19th of January 379, he declared Theodosius his partner in the empire, and committed to his care all the provinces which had been governed by Valens.\n\nTheodosius is greatly extolled by the historians of those ages on account of his extraordinary valour and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>; and for these qualifications has been honoured with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURNAME\">surname</a> of the Great. From the many persecuting laws, however, made in his time, it would seem that his piety was at least very much misguided; and that if he was naturally of a humane and compassionate disposition, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> and passion had often totally obscured it. He certainly was a man of great conduct and experience in war; and indeed the present state of the empire called for an exertion of all his abilities. The provinces of Dacia, Thrace, and Illyricum, were already lost; the Goths, Taifali, Alans, and Huns, were masters of the greatest part of these provinces, and had ravaged and laid waste the rest. The Iberians, Armenians, and Persians, were likewise up in arms, and ready to take advantage of the distracted state of the empire. The few soldiers who had\nConstan-\n\ntinopolitan\n\nhistory.\n\nhad survived the late defeat, kept within the strong holds of Thrace, without daring so much as to look abroad, much less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> the victorious enemy, who moved about the country in great bodies. But notwithstanding this critical situation, the historians of those times give us no account of the transactions of the year 379. Many great battles indeed are said to have been fought, and as many victories obtained by Theodosius; but the accounts of these are so confused and contradictory, that no fires can be laid upon them.\n\nIn the month of February 380, Theodosius was seized with a dangerous malady, so that Gratian found himself obliged to carry on the war alone. This emperor, apprehending that the neighbouring barbarians might break into some of the provinces, concluded a peace with the Goths, which was confirmed by Theodosius on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a>. The treaty was very advantageous to the barbarians; but they disregarding all their engagements, no sooner heard that Gratian had left Illyricum, than they passed the Danube, and breaking into Thrace and Pannonia, advanced as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACEDONIA\">Macedonia</a>, destroying all with fire and sword. Theodosius, however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> together his forces, marched against them; and, according to the most respectable authorities, gained a complete victory; though Zosimus relates, that he was utterly defeated.\n\nThe following year, Athanaric, the most powerful of all the Gothic princes, being driven out by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a> at home, recurred to Theodosius, by whom he was received with great tokens of friendship. The emperor himself went out to meet him, and attended him with his numerous retinue into the city. The Gothic prince died the same year; and Theodosius caused him to be buried after the Roman manner with such pomp and solemnity, that the Goths, who attended him in his flight, returned home with a revolution never to molest the Romans any more. Nay, out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> to the emperor, they took upon them to guard the banks of the Danube, and prevent the empire from being invaded on that side.\n\nIn 383, one Maximus revolted against Gratian in Britain; and in the end, having got the unhappy emperor into his power, caused him to be put to death, and assumed the empire of the West himself. Gratian had divided his dominions with his brother Valentinian, whom he allowed to reign in Italy and West Illyricum, reserving the rest to himself. Maximus, therefore, immediately after his usurpation, sent deputies to Theodosius, assuring him that he had no designs on the dominions of Valentinian. As Theodosius at that time found himself in danger from the barbarians, he not only forbore to attack Maximus after this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a>, but even acknowledged him for his partner in the empire. It was not long, however, before the ambition of the usurper prompted him to break his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a>. In 387, he passed the Alps on a sudden; and meeting with no opposition, marched to Milan where Valentinian usually resided. The young prince fled first to Aquileia; and from thence to Thessalonica, to implore the protection of Theodosius. The latter, in answer to Valentinian's letter, informed him, that he was not at all surprised at the progress Maximus had made, because the usurper had protected, and Valentinian had persecuted, the orthodox Christians. At last he prevailed on the young prince to renounce the Arian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a> which he had hitherto maintained; after which Theodosius promised to afflit him with all the forces of the East. At first, however, he sent messengers to Maximus, earnestly exhorting him to restore the provinces he had taken from Valentinian, and content himself with Gaul, Spain, and Britain. But the usurper would hearken to no terms. This very year he besieged and took his successor, Aquileia, Quaderna, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONONIA\">Bononia</a>, Mutina, Rheygum, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACENTIA\">Placentia</a>, and many other cities in Italy. The following year he was acknowledged in Rome, and in all the provinces of Africa. Theodosius, therefore, finding a war inevitable, spent the remaining months of this and the beginning of the following year in making the necessary preparations. His army consisted chiefly of Goths, Huns, Alans, and other barbarians, whom he was glad to take into the service in order to prevent their raising disturbances on the frontiers. He defeated Maximus in two battles, took him prisoner, and put him to death. The usurper had left his son Victor, Theodosius, whom he created Augustus, in Gaul, to awe the inhabitants in his absence. Against him the emperor despatched Arbogastes, who took him prisoner after having dispersed the troops that attended him, and put him to death. The victory was used afterwards by Theodosius with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLEMENCY\">clemency</a> and moderation.\n\nIn 389, Theodosius took a journey to Rome; and, according to Prudentius, at this time converted the senate and people from idolatry to Christianity. The next year was remarkable for the destruction of the celebrated temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERAPIS\">Serapis</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>; which, all Egypt according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMIANUS_MARCELLINUS\">Ammianus Marcellinus</a>, destroyed, surpassed all others in the world, that of Jupiter Capitolinus alone excepted. The reason of its being now destroyed was as follows. Theophilus, bishop of Alexandria, having begged and obtained of the emperor an old temple, formerly consecrated to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACCHUS\">Bacchus</a>, but then ruined and forsaken, with a design to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> it into a church, the workmen found among the rubbish several obscene figures, which the bishop, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> the superstition of the Heathens, caused to be exposed to public view. This provoked the Pagans to such a degree, that they flew to arms; and falling unexpectedly upon the Christians, cut great numbers of them in pieces. The latter, however, soon took arms in their own defence; and being supported by the few soldiers who were quartered in the city, began to repel force by force. Thus a civil war was kindled, and no day passed without some encounter. The Pagans used to retire to the temple of Serapis; and thence falling out unexpectedly seized on such Christians as they met, and dragging them into the temple, either forced them by the most exquisite torments to sacrifice to their idol, or, if they refused, racked them to death. As soon as they expected to be attacked by the emperor's troops, they chose a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> named Olympus for their leader, with a design to defend themselves to the last extremity. The emperor, however, would not suffer any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> to be inflicted upon them for the lives of those they had taken away, but readily forgave them; however, he ordered all the temples of Alexandria to be immediately pulled down, and commanded the bishop to see his orders put in execution. The Pagans no sooner heard that the emperor\nemperor was acquainted with their proceedings than they abandoned the temple, which was in a short time destroyed by Theophilus; nothing being left except the foundations, which could not be removed on account of the extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> and size of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>. Not satisfied with the destruction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALEXANDRIAN\">Alexandrian</a> temples, the zealous bishop encouraged the people to pull down all the other temples, oratories, chapels, and places set apart for the worship of the Heathen gods throughout Egypt, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> of the gods themselves to be either burnt or melted down. Of the innumerable statues which at that time were to be found in Egypt, he is said to have spared but one, viz., that of an ape, in order to expose the Pagan religion to ridicule. On his return to Constantinople, Theodosius ordered such temples as were yet standing to be thrown down, and the Arians to be everywhere driven out of the cities.\n\nIn 392, Valentinian, emperor of the West, was treacherously murdered by Arbogastes his general; who, though he might afterwards have easily seized on the sovereignty himself, chose to confer it upon one Eugenius, and to reign in his name. This new usurper, though a Christian, was greatly favoured by the Pagans, who were well apprized that he only bore the title of emperor, while the whole power lodged in Arbogastes, who pretended to be greatly attached to their religion. The avaricious began to appear anew, and informed him that he was destined to the empire of the whole world; that he would soon gain a complete victory over Theodosius, who was as much hated as Eugenius was beloved by the gods, &c. But though Eugenius seemed to favour the Pagans, yet in the very beginning of his reign he wrote to St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBROSE\">Ambrose</a>. The holy man did not answer his letter till he was pressed by some friends to recommend them to the new prince; and then he wrote to this infamous usurper with all the respect due to an emperor. Soon after his accession to the empire, Eugenius sent deputies to Theodosius; and they are said to have been received by him in a very obliging manner. He did not, however, intend to enter into any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with this usurper, but immediately began his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> preparations. In 394, he set out from Constantinople, and was at Adrianople on the 15th of June that year. He bent his march through Dacia, and the other provinces between Thrace and the Julian Alps, with a design to force the passes of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, and break into Italy before the army of Eugenius was in a condition to oppose him. On his arrival at the Alps, he found these passes guarded by Flavianus prefect of Italy, at the head of a considerable body of Roman troops. These were utterly defeated by Theodosius, who thereupon crossed the Alps and advanced into Italy. He was soon met by Eugenius; and a bloody battle ensued, without any decisive advantage on either side. The next day the emperor led his troops in person against the enemy, utterly defeated them, and took their camp. Eugenius was taken prisoner by his own men, and brought to Theodosius, who reproached him with the murder of Valentinian, with the calamities he had brought on the empire by his unjust usurpation, and with putting his confidence in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>, and not in the true God; for on his chief standard he had displayed the image of that fabulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a>. Eugenius begged earnestly for his life; but while he lay prostrate at the emperor's feet, his own soldiers cut off his head, and carrying it about on the point of a spear, showed it to those in the camp, who had not yet submitted to Theodosius. At this they were all thunderstruck; but being informed that Theodosius was ready to receive them into favour, they threw down their arms and submitted. After this, Arbogastes, despairing of pardon, fled to the mountains; but being informed that diligent search was made for him, he laid violent hands on himself. His children, and those of Eugenius, took sanctuary in churches; but the emperor not only pardoned, but took the opportunity of converting them to Christianity, restored them to their paternal estates, and raised them to considerable employments in the state. Soon after this, Theodosius appointed his son Honorius emperor of the west, assigning him for his share Italy, Gaul, Spain, Africa, and West Illyricum. The next year, as he prepared for his return to Constantinople, he was seized with a droop, owing to the great fatigues he had undergone during the war. As soon as he perceived himself to be in danger, he made his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>; by which he bequeathed the empire of the east to Arcadius, and confirmed Honorius in the possession of the west. He likewise confirmed the pardon which he had granted to all those who had borne arms against him, and remitted a tribute which had proved very burdensome to the people; and charged his two sons to see these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of his will executed. He died at Milan on the 17th of January 395, in the 16th year of his reign and 50th of his age.\n\nFrom the time of Theodosius to the time when the Roman empire in the west was totally destroyed by the Goths, we find but very little remarkable in the history of Constantinople. At this time the eastern empire was usurped by Basiliscus, who had driven out Zeno the lawful emperor; being assisted in his conspiracy by the empress Verina his sister. Zeno fled into Isauria, whither he was pursued by Illus and Tredones, two of the usurper's generals; who having easily defeated the few troops he had with him, forced the unhappy prince to shut himself up in a castle, which they immediately invested. But in a short time Basiliscus having disobligeed the people by his cruelty, avarice, and other bad qualities, for which he was no less remarkable than his predecessor had been, his generals joined with Zeno, whom they restored to the throne. After his restoration, Zeno having got Basiliscus into his power, confined him in a castle of Cappadocia together with his wife Zenonides, where they starved both perished with hunger and cold. This happened to death in the year 467, after Basiliscus had reigned about 20 months. During the time of this usurpation a dreadful fire happened at Constantinople, which consumed great part of the city, with the library containing 120,000 volumes; among which were the works of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>, written, as is said, on the great gut of a dragon 120 feet long.\n\nThe misfortunes which Zeno had undergone did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> any reformation upon him. He still continued the same vicious courses which had given occasion to the usurpation of Basiliscus. Other conspiracies were formed against him, but he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> to escape them. He engaged in a war with the\nthe Ostrogoths, in which he proved unsuccessful, and was obliged to yield the provinces of Lower Dacia and Moesia to them. In a short time, however, Theodoric their king made an irruption into Thrace, and advanced within 15 miles of Constantinople, with a design to besiege that capital; but the following year, 485, they retired in order to attack Odoacer king of Italy; of which country Theodoric was proclaimed king in 493. The emperor Zeno died in the year 491, in the 65th year of his age, and 17th of his reign.\n\nThe Roman empire had now for a long time been on the decline: the ancient valour and military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> which had for such a long time rendered the Romans superior to other nations, had greatly degenerated; so that they were now by no means so powerful as formerly. The tumults and disorders which had happened in the empire from time to time by the many usurpations, had contributed also to weaken it very much. But what proved of the greatest detriment was the allowing vast swarms of barbarians to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in the different provinces, and to serve in the Roman empire in separate and independent bodies. This had proved the immediate cause of the dissolution of the western empire; but as it affected the eastern parts less, the Constantinopolitan empire continued for upwards of 900 years after the western one was totally dissolved. The weak and imprudent administration of Zeno, and Anastasius who succeeded him, had reduced the eastern empire still more; and it might possibly have expired in a short time after the western one, had not the wise and vigorous conduct of Justin, and his partner Julianian, revived in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the ancient martial spirit which had originally raised the Roman empire to its highest pitch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>.\n\nJustin ascended the throne in 518. In 521 he engaged in a war with the Persians, who had all along been very formidable enemies to the Roman name. Against them he employed the famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELISARIUS\">Belisarius</a>; but of him we hear nothing remarkable till after the accession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTINIAN\">Justinian</a>. This prince was the nephew of Justin, and was by him taken as his partner in the empire in 527; and the same year Justin died, in the 77th year of his age and 9th of his reign. Justinian being now sole master of the empire, bent his whole force against the Persians. The latter proved successful in the first engagement; but were soon after utterly defeated by Belisarius on the frontiers of Persia, and likewise by another general named Dorotheus in Armenia. The war continued with various success during the first five years of Justinian's reign. In the sixth year a peace was concluded upon the following terms: 1. That the Roman emperor should pay to Cosroes, the king of Persia, 1000 pounds weight of gold. 2. That both princes should restore the places they had taken during the wars. 3. That the commander of the Roman forces should no longer reside at Dara on the Persian frontiers, but at a place called Constantina in Mesopotamia, as he had formerly done. 4. That the Iberians, who had sided with the Romans, should be at liberty either to return to their own country or to remain at Constantinople. This peace, concluded in 532, was styled eternal; but in the event proved of very short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>.\n\nAbout this time happened at Constantinople the greatest tumult mentioned in history. It began among the different factions in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CIRCUS\">circus</a>, but ended in an open rebellion. The multitude, highly dissatisfied with the conduct of John the prefectus praetorio, and of Tiberianus then qu\u00e6stor, forced Hypatius, nephew to the great emperor Anastasius, to accept the empire, and proclaimed him with great solemnity in the forum. As soon as the two above-mentioned ministers were greatly alarmed by the populace on account of their avarice, Justinian immediately discharged them, hoping by that means to appease the tumult; but this was so far from answering the purpose, that the multitude only grew the more outrageous upon it; and most of the senators joining them, the emperor was so much alarmed, that he had thoughts of abandoning the city and making his escape by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILEMMA\">dilemma</a> the empress Theodora encouraged and persuaded him rather to part with his life than the kingdom; and he at last resolved to defend himself to the utmost, with the few senators who had not yet abandoned him. In the meantime, the rebels having attempted in vain to force the gates of the palace, carried Hypatius in triumph to the circus; where, while he was beholding the sports from the imperial throne, amidst the shouts and acclamations of the people, Belisarius, who had been recalled from Persia, entered the city with a considerable body of troops. Being then apprised of the usurpation of Hypatius, he marched straight to the circus; fell sword in hand upon the dismayed multitude; and with the assistance of a band of Heruli, headed by Mundus governor of Illyricum, cut about 30,000 of them in pieces. Hypatius the usurper, and Pompeius another of the nephews of Anastasius, were taken prisoners and carried to the emperor, by whose orders they were both beheaded, and their bodies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> into the sea. Their estates were confiscated, and likewise the estates of such senators as had joined with them; but the emperor caused great part of their lands and effects to be afterwards restored, together with their honours and dignities, to their children.\n\nJustinian having now no other enemy to contend with, turned his arms against the Vandals in Africa, and the Goths in Italy; both which provinces he recovered out of the hands of the barbarians*. But before his general Belisarius had time to establish fully both the Roman power in Italy, he was recalled in order to carry on the war against Cosroes king of Persia, who, in defiance of the treaty formerly concluded in 532, entered the Roman dominions at the head of a powerful army. The same year, however, a peace was concluded between the two nations upon the following conditions: 1. That the Romans should, within two months, pay to the Persian king 5000 pounds weight of gold, and an annual pension of 500. 2. That the Persians should relinquish all claim to the fortresses of Dara, and maintain a body of troops to guard the Caesarian gates, and prevent the barbarians from breaking into the empire. 3. That upon payment of the above-mentioned sum, Cosroes should immediately withdraw his troops from the Roman dominions. The treaty being signed, and the stipulated sum paid, Cosroes began to march back again; but by the way plundered several cities as if the war had still continued. Hereupon Justinian resolved to pursue the war with the utmost vigour; and for that purpose deftly patched.\npatched Belisarius into the east. But soon after he was obliged to recall him in order to oppose the Goths who had gained great advantages in Italy after his departure. The Persian war was then carried on with indifferent success till the year 558, when a peace was concluded upon the emperor again paying an immense sum to the enemy. The same year the Huns, passing the Danube in the depth of winter, marched in two bodies directly for Constantinople; and laying waste the countries through which they passed, came without meeting the least opposition, within 150 furlongs of the city. But Belisarius marching out against them with a handful of men, put them to flight; the emperor, however, to prevent them from invading the empire anew, agreed to pay them an annual tribute, upon their promising to defend the empire against all other barbarians, and to serve in the Roman armies when required. This was the last exploit performed by Belisarius, who on his return to Constantinople was disgraced, stripped of all his employments, and confined to his house, on pretence of a conspiracy against the emperor*. In the year 565 a real conspiracy was formed against Justinian, which he happily escaped, and the conspirators were executed; but the emperor did not long survive it, being carried off by a natural death in 566, in the 39th year of his reign.\n\nDuring the reign of Justinian, the majesty of the Roman empire seemed to revive. He recovered the provinces of Italy and Africa out of the hands of the barbarians, by whom they had been held for a number of years; but after his death they were soon lost, and the empire tended fast to dissolution. In 569 Italy was conquered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOMBARDS\">Lombards</a>, who held it for the space of 200 years. Some amends, however, was made for the loss by the acquisition of Pannonia; the inhabitants of which, being persecuted by the Persians on account of the Christian religion which they professed, revolted to the Romans. This produced a war between the two nations, who continued to weaken each other, till at last the Persian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a> was utterly overthrown, and that of the Romans greatly reduced by the Saracens\u2020. These new enemies attacked the Romans in the year 632, and pursued their conquests with incredible rapidity. In the space of four years they reduced the provinces of Egypt, Syria, and Palestine. In 648 they were also masters of Mesopotamia, Phoenicia, Africa, Cyprus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARADUS\">Aradus</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RHODES\">Rhodes</a>; and having defeated the Roman fleet, commanded by the emperor Constans in person, they concluded a peace on condition of keeping the vast extent of territory they had seized, and paying for it 1000 nummi a year.\n\nAn expedition against the Lombards was about this time undertaken, but with very little success, a body of 20,000 Romans being almost entirely cut off by one of the Lombard generals. In 671 the Saracens ravaged several provinces, made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> in Sicily, took and plundered the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a>, and overran the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, destroying every thing with fire and sword. In like manner they laid waste Cilicia; and having passed the winter at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMYRNA\">Smyrna</a>, they entered Thrace in the winter of the year 672, and laid siege to Constantinople itself. Here, however, they were repulsed with great loss; but next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> they renewed their attempt, in which they met with the same bad success; many of their ships being burnt by the Constansea fire, as it was called, because it burnt under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; and in their return home their fleet was wrecked off the Scyllean promontory. At last a peace was concluded for 30 years, on condition that the Saracens should retain all the provinces they had seized; and that they should pay to the emperor and his successors 3000 pounds weight of gold, 50 slaves, and as many choice horses.\n\nThis peace was scarcely concluded, when the empire was invaded by a new enemy, who proved very troublesome for a long time. These were the Bulgarians\u2021, the Bulgars who breaking into Thrace, defeated the Roman army sent against them, and ravaged the country far and wide. The emperor consented to pay them an annual pension, rather than continue a doubtful war; and allowed them to settle in Lower Moesia, which from them was afterwards called Bulgaria. In 687, they were attacked by Justinian II, who entered their country without provocation, or regarding the treaties formerly concluded with them. But they falling suddenly upon him, drove him out of their country, and obliged him to restore the towns and captives he had taken. In 697, this emperor was deposed; and in his exile fled to Trebelis king of the Bulgarians, by whom he was kindly entertained, and by whose means he was restored to his throne; but soon forgetting this favour, he invaded the country of the Bulgarians, with a design to wrest from them those provinces which he had yielded to them. He was attended in this enterprise by no better success than his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INGRATITUDE\">ingratitude</a> defeated Justinian, his army being utterly defeated, and he himself obliged to make his escape in a light vessel to Constantinople. The Bulgarians continued their inroads and ravages at different times, generally defeated the Romans who ventured to oppose them, till the year 800, the seventh of the reign of Nicephorus, when they surprised the city of Sardica in Moesia, and put the whole garrison, consisting of 6000 men, to the sword. The emperor marched against them with a considerable army; but the enemy retired at his approach; and he, instead of pursuing them, returned to Constantinople.\n\nTwo years after, he entered Bulgaria at the head of a powerful army, destroying everything with fire and sword. The king offered to conclude a peace with ravaged by him upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> terms; but Nicephorus, rejecting his proposals, continued to waste the country, destroying the cities, and putting all the inhabitants, without distinction of sex or age, to the sword. The king was so much affected with these cruelties which were exercised on his subjects, that he sent a second embassy to Nicephorus, offering to conclude a peace with him upon any terms, provided he would quit his country. But Nicephorus dismissing the ambassadors with scorn, the Bulgarian monarch attacked off with his unexpectedly the Roman camp, forced it, and cut off whole army, almost the whole army, with the emperor himself, and many a great number of patricians. His successor Michael likewise engaged in a war with the Bulgarians; but being utterly defeated, he was so grieved that he resigned the empire. After this the Bulgarians continued to be very formidable enemies to the empire, till the year 979, when they were attacked by Basilus II. The Bulgarians were at that time governed by a king named Samuel; who having ravaged the Roman territories, thus II.\ntories, as was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> practice of his nation, Basilus sent against him one Nicephorus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-URANUS\">Uranus</a> at the head of a powerful army. Uranus, leaving his baggage at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LARISSA\">Larissa</a>, reached by long marches the Sperchius, and encamped with his whole army over against the enemy, who lay on the opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>. As the river was greatly swollen with the heavy rains that had lately fallen, Samuel, not imagining the Romans would attempt to pass it, suffered his troops to roam in large parties about the country in quest of booty. But Uranus having at length found out a place where the river was fordable, passed it in the dead of the night without being perceived. He then fell upon the Bulgarians who were left in the camp, and lay for the most part asleep; cut great numbers of them in pieces; took a great number of prisoners, with all their baggage; and made himself master of their camp. Samuel and his son were dangerously wounded; and would have been taken, had they not all that day concealed themselves among the dead. The next night they stole away to the mountains of Aetolia, and from thence made their escape into Bulgaria. The following year the emperor entered Bulgaria at the head of a numerous and well-disciplined army; defeated Samuel in a pitched battle, and took several strong cities. The emperor himself, however, at last, narrowly escaped being cut off with his whole army; being unexpectedly attacked by the Bulgarians in a narrow pass. From this danger he was relieved by the arrival of Nicephorus Xiphias, governor of Philippopolis, with a considerable body of troops; who falling upon the enemies rear, put them to flight. Basilus pursued them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>; and having taken an incredible number of captives, caused their eyes to be pulled out; leaving to every hundred a guide with one eye, that he might conduct them to Samuel. This shocking spectacle so affected the unhappy king, that he fell into a deep swoon, and died two days after. The Roman emperor pursued his conquests, and in the space of two years made himself master of most of the enemies strong holds. He defeated also the successor of Samuel in several engagements; and having at last killed him in battle, the Bulgarians submitted themselves without reserve. The vast treasures of their princes were by Basilus distributed among his soldiers by way of donative. Soon after, the widow of the late king, with her six daughters and three of her sons, surrendered themselves to the Roman emperor, by whom they were received with the utmost civility and respect. This obliging behaviour encouraged the three other sons of the late king, and most of the princes of the blood, who had taken shelter in the mountains, to submit, and throw themselves on the emperor's mercy.\n\nIbatzes, however, a person nearly allied to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> family, who had distinguished himself in a very eminent manner during the whole course of the war, refused to submit, and fled to a steep and craggy mountain, with a design to defend himself there to the last extremity. Basilus endeavoured to cause him submit by fair means, but he equally despised both threats and promises. At last Eutathius Daphnomelus, whom Basilus had lately appointed governor of Achridus, the chief city of Bulgaria, undertook to secure him by a most desperate and improbable scheme. Without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> his design to any, he repaired, with two persons in whom he could confide, to the mountain on which Ibatzes had fortified himself. He hoped to pass undiscovered among the many strangers who flocked thither to celebrate the approaching feast of the Virgin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, for whom Ibatzes had a particular veneration. In this he found himself mistaken; for he was known by the guards, and carried before the prince. To him he pretended to have something of importance to communicate; but as soon as Ibatzes had retired with him into a remote place, Daphnomelus threw himself suddenly upon him, and with the assistance of the two men whom he had brought with him, pulled out both his eyes, and got safe to an abandoned castle on the top of the hill. Here they were immediately surrounded by the troops of Ibatzes; but Daphnomelus exhorting them now to submit to the emperor, by whom he assured them they would be well received, they congratulated Daphnomelus on his success, and suffered him to conduct the unhappy Ibatzes a prisoner to Basilus. The emperor was no less surprised than pleased at the success of the bold attempt; and rewarded Daphnomelus with the government of Dyrrhachium, and all the rich moveables of his prisoner. After this, having accomplished the entire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of Bulgaria, he returned to Constantinople with an incredible number of captives; where he was received by the senate and people with all possible demonstrations of joy.\n\nAll this time the Saracens had at intervals invaded the Roman dominions, and even attempted to make themselves masters of Constantinople. Their internal divisions, however, rendered them now much less formidable enemies than they had formerly been; so that some provinces were even recovered for a time out of their hands; though the weak and distracted state of the empire rendered it impossible to preserve such conquests. But in 1041, the empire was invaded by an enemy, not very powerful at that time indeed, but who, by degrees gathered strength sufficient to overthrow both the Roman and Saracen empires. These were the Turks; who having quitted their ancient habitations in the neighbourhood of Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAUCASUS\">Caucasus</a>, and passed through the Caspian straits, settled in Armenia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a>, about the year 844. There they continued an unknown and despotic people, till the intestine wars of the Saracens gave them an opportunity of aggrandizing themselves. About the year 1030, Mohammed the son of Samraiel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SULTAN\">sultan</a> of Persia, not finding himself a match for Pifaris sultan of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLON\">Babylon</a>, with whom he was at war, had recourse to the Turks, who sent him 3000 men under the command of Tangrolipix, a leading man among them. By their assistance Mohammed defeated his adversary; but when the Turks desired leave to return home, he refused to part with them. Upon this they withdrew without his consent to a neighbouring desert; and being there joined by several discontented Persians, began to make frequent inroads into the sultan's territories. Against them Mohammed immediately dispatched an army of 20,000 men; who being surprised in the night, were utterly defeated by Tangrolipix. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of this victory drew multitudes to him from all parts; so that in a short time Tangrolipix saw himself at the head of 50,000 men. Upon this Mohammed marched against them in person,\nCon\n\nCon\n\nson, but was thrown from his horse in the beginning of the engagement, and killed by the fall; upon which his men threw down their arms, and submitted to Tangrolipix.\n\nAfter this victory the Turkish general made war upon the sultan of Babylon; whom he at length slew, and annexed his dominions to his own. He then sent his nephew, named Cutlu-Mojes, against the Arabians; but by them he was defeated, and forced to fly towards Media. Through this province he was denied a passage by Stephen the Roman governor; upon which Cutlu-Mojes was obliged to force a passage by encountering the Roman army. There he put to flight, took the governor himself prisoner, and without any further opposition reached the confines of Persia, where he sold Stephen for a slave. Returning from thence to Tangrolipix, he excused, in the best manner he could, his defeat by the Arabians; but at the same time acquainted him with his victory over the Romans in Media, encouraging him to invade that fertile country, which he said might be easily conquered, as it was inhabited by none but women, meaning the Romans. At that time Tangrolipix did not hearken to his advice, but marched against the Arabians at the head of a numerous army. He was, however, attended with no better success than his nephew had been; and therefore began to reflect on what he had told him. Soon after he sent Afan his brother's son with an army of 20,000 men to reduce Media. Pursuant to his orders, the young prince entered that country, and committed everywhere dreadful ravages; but being in the end drawn into an ambush by the Roman generals, he was cut off with his whole army. Tangrolipix, no way discouraged by this misfortune, sent a new army into Media near 100,000 strong; who, after having ravaged the country without opposition, laid siege to Artza a place of great trade, and therefore reckoned the most wealthy in those parts. Not being able to reduce it by any other means, they set it on fire; and thus in a short time it was utterly destroyed: the buildings being reduced to ashes, and 150,000 of the inhabitants perished either by the flames or the sword.\n\nAfter this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a> Halim, half-brother to Tangrolipix, hearing that the Romans, reinforced with a body of troops under the command of Liparites governor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IBERIA\">Iberia</a>, had taken the field, marched against them, and offered them battle; which they not declining, the two armies engaged with incredible fury. The victory continued long doubtful; but at length inclined to the Romans; who nevertheless did not think proper to pursue the fugitives, as their general Liparites was taken prisoner. The emperor, greatly concerned for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a> of Liparites, dispatched ambassadors with rich presents, and a large sum of money to redeem him, and at the same time to conclude an alliance with Tangrolipix. The sultan received the presents; but generously returned them together with the money to Liparites, whom he set at liberty without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RANSOM\">ransom</a>; only requiring him, at his departure, never more to bear arms against the Turks. Not long after, Tangrolipix sent a person of great authority among the Turks, with the character of ambassador, to Constantinople; who having arrogantly exhorted the emperor to submit to his master, and acknowledge himself his tributary, was ignominiously driven out of the city.\n\nTangrolipix, highly affronted at the reception his ambassador had met with, entered Iberia while the emperor Constantine Monomachus was engaged in a war with the Patzinace, a Scythian nation. Having ravaged that country, he returned from thence to Mantzichierta, a place defended by a numerous garrison, and fortified with a triple wall and deep ditches. However, as it was situated in an open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> country, he hoped to be master of it in a short time. But finding the besieged determined to defend themselves to the last extremity, he resolved to raise the siege, after he had continued it 30 days. One of his officers, however, named Alcan, prevailed on him to continue it but one day longer, and to commit the management of the attacks to him. This being granted, Alcan disposed his men with such skill, and to encouraged them by his example, that notwithstanding the vigorous opposition they met with, the place would have probably been taken, had not Alcan been slain as he was mounting the wall. The besieged, knowing him by the richness of his armour, drew him by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> into the city, and cutting off his head threw it over the wall among the enemy; which so disheartened them, that they gave over the assault and retired. The next spring Tangrolipix returned, and ravaged Iberia with the utmost cruelty, sparing neither sex nor age. But on the approach of the Roman army he retired to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAURIS\">Tauris</a>, leaving 30,000 men behind him to infest the frontiers of the empire. This they did with great success, the borders being through the avarice of Monomachus unguarded. Till the time of this emperor, the provinces bordering on the countries of the barbarians had maintained, at their own charge, forces to defend them; and were on that account exempted from paying tribute; but as Monomachus exacted from them the same sums that were paid by others, they were no longer in a condition to defend themselves.\n\nIn 1062 died the emperor Constantine Ducas, having left the empire to his three sons, Michael, Anselmus, and Constantine; but as they were all very young, he appointed the empress Eudocia regent during their minority, after having required of her an oath never to marry; which oath was with great firmness lodged in the hands of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a>. He likewise obliged the senators solemnly to swear that they would acknowledge none for their sovereign but his three sons. No sooner, however, was he dead, than the Turks, hearing that the empire was governed by a woman, broke into Mesopotamia, Cilicia, and Cappadocia, destroying all with fire and sword. The empress was no way in a condition to oppose them, the greater part of the army having been disbanded in her husband's life time, and the troops that were still on foot being undisciplined, and altogether unfit for service. The concern which this gave the empress was aggravated by the seditions speeches of a discontented party at home, who repeated on all occasions that the present state of affairs required a man of courage and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> at the helm, instead of a weak and helpless woman; and as they imagined the empress would never think of marrying, in consequence of the oath she had\nCon\n\n[585]\n\nCon\n\nThe empress determined to break her oath.\n\nShe recovered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> in which it was contained,\n\nand marries Romanus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOGENES\">Diogenes</a>.\n\nHe passes over into Asia.\n\nHe defeats the Turks.\n\nGains a second victory.\n\nhad taken, they hoped by these speeches to induce the people to revolt, and choose a new emperor. This Eudocia was aware of; and therefore determined to prevent the evils that threatened herself and her family, by marrying some person of merit who was capable of defeating her enemies both at home and abroad. At this time one Romanus Diogenes, a person of a most beautiful aspect, extraordinary parts, and illustrious birth, being accused of aspiring to the empire, tried and convicted, was brought forth to receive sentence of death. But the empress, touched with compassion at his appearance, gently upbraided him with his ambition, let him at liberty, and soon after appointed him commander in chief of all her forces. In this situation he acquitted himself so well, that the empress resolved to marry him if she could but recover the writing in which her oath was contained out of the hands of the patriarch. In order to this, she applied to a favourite eunuch, who going to the patriarch, told him that the empress was to take with his nephew named Bardas, that she was determined to marry and raise him to the empire, provided the patriarch absolved her from the oath she had taken, and convinced the senate of the lawfulness of her marriage. The patriarch, dazzled with the prospect of his nephew's promotion, readily undertook to perform both. He first obtained the consent of the senate by representing to them the dangerous state of the empire, and exclaiming against the rash oath which the jealousy of the late emperor had extorted from the empress. He then publicly discharged her from it; restored the writing to her; and exhorted her to marry some deserving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, who being entrusted with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> authority, might be capable of defending the empire. The empress, thus discharged from her oath, married a few days after Romanus Diogenes; who was thereupon proclaimed emperor, to the great disappointment of the patriarch.\n\nAs the new emperor was a man of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> and experience in war, he no sooner saw himself vested with the sovereign power, than he took upon him the command of the army, and passed over into Asia with the few forces he could assemble, recruiting and inuring them on his march to military discipline, which had been utterly neglected in the preceding reigns. On his arrival in that continent, he was informed that the Turks had surprised and plundered the city of Neo-cesarea, and were retiring with their booty. On this news he hastened after them at the head of a chosen body of light-armed troops, and came up with them on the third day. As the Turks were marching in disorder, without the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of an enemy, Romanus cut great numbers of them in pieces, and easily recovered the booty; after which he pursued his march to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEPPO\">Aleppo</a>, which he retook from them, together with Hierapolis, where he built a strong castle.\n\nAs he was returning to join the forces he had left behind him, he was met by a numerous body of Turks, who attempted to cut off his retreat. At first he pretended to decline an engagement through fear; but attacked them afterwards with such vigour when they least expected it, that he put them to flight at the first onset, and might have gained a complete victory had he thought proper to pursue them. After this, several towns submitted to him; but the season being now far spent, the emperor returned to Constantinople. The following year he passed over into Asia early in the spring; and being informed that the Turks had sacked the rich city of Iconium, besides gaining other considerable advantages, he marched in person against them. But the Turks, not thinking it advisable to wait his coming, retired in great haste. The Armenians, however, encouraged by the approach of the defeated emperor's army, fell upon the enemy in the plains of Tarus, put them to flight, and stripped them both of their baggage and the booty they had taken. The spring following the emperor once more entered Asia at the head of a considerable army which he had raised, and with incredible pains disciplined during the winter. When the two armies drew near to each other, Axan, the Turkish sultan, and son of the famous Tangrolipix, sent proposals to Romanus for a lasting and honourable peace. These were imprudently rejected, and a desperate engagement ensued, when, innumerable, despite of the utmost efforts of the emperor, his army scattered and was routed, and he himself wounded and taken prisoner. When this news was brought to Axan, he could scarcely believe it; but being convinced by the appearance of the royal captive in his presence, he tenderly embraced him, and addressed him in an affectionate manner: \"Grieve not (said he), most noble emperor, at your misfortune; for such is the chance of war, sometimes overwhelming one, and sometimes another; you shall have no occasion to complain of your captivity; for I will not use you as my prisoner, but as an emperor.\" The Turk was as good as his word. He lodged the emperor in a royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAVILION\">pavilion</a>; assigned him attendants, with an equipage suitable to his quality; and discharged such prisoners as he desired. After he had for some days entertained his royal captive with extraordinary magnificence, a perpetual peace was concluded between them, and the emperor dismissed with the greatest marks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> imaginable. He then set out with the Turkish ambassador for Constantinople, where the peace was to be ratified; but by the way he was informed that Eudocia deposed had been driven from the throne by John the Poet and brother of Constantine Ducas, and Pellas a leading man in the senate, who had confined her to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONASTERY\">monastery</a>, and proclaimed her eldest son, Michael Ducas, emperor. On this intelligence, Romanus retired to a strong castle near Theodosiopolis, where he hoped in a short time to be joined by great numbers of his friends and adherents. But in the mean time John, who had taken upon him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">guardian</a> to the young prince, dispatched Andronicus with a considerable army against him. Andronicus having easily defeated the small army which Romanus had with him, obliged him to fly to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADANA\">Adana</a> a city in Cilicia, where he was closely besieged, and at last obliged to surrender. Andronicus carried his prisoner into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHRYGIA\">Phrygia</a>, where he fell dangerously ill, being, as was suspected, secretly poisoned. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> being too slow in its operation, John ordered his eyes to be put out, which was done with such cruelty that he died soon after, in the year 1067, having reigned three years and eight months.\n\nAxan was no sooner informed of the tragic end of his friend and ally, than he resolved to invade the empire again.\nempire anew; and that not with a design only to plunder as formerly, but to conquer, and keep what he had once conquered. The emperor dispatched against him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Comnenus, with a considerable army; but he was utterly defeated and taken prisoner by Axan. Another army was quickly sent off under the command of John Ducas the emperor's uncle. He gained at first some advantages, and would probably have put a stop to their conquests, had not one Rufelius, or Urselius, revolted with the troops he had under his command, caused himself to be proclaimed emperor, and reduced several cities in Phrygia and Cappadocia. Against him John marched with all his forces, suffering the Turks in the mean time to pursue their conquests; but coming to an engagement with the rebels, his army was entirely defeated and himself taken prisoner. Notwithstanding this victory, Rufelius was so much alarmed at the progress of the Turks, that he not only released his prisoner, but joined with him against the common enemy, by whom they were both defeated and taken prisoners. Axan, however, was for some time prevented from pursuing his conquest by Cutlu-Moles, nephew to the late Tangrolipix. He had revolted against his uncle; but being defeated by him in a pitched battle, had taken refuge in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, whence he now returned at the head of a considerable army in order to dispute the sovereignty with Axan. But while the two armies were preparing to engage, the caliph of Babylon, who was still looked upon as the successor of the great prophet, interposed his authority. He represented the dangers of their intestine dissensions; and by his mediation, an agreement was at last concluded, on condition that Axan should enjoy undisturbed the monarchy lately left him by his father, and Cutlu-Moles should possess such provinces of the Roman empire as he or his sons should in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time conquer.\n\nAfter this agreement, both the Turkish princes turned their forces against the empire; and before the year 1077, made themselves masters of all Media, Lycaonia, Cappadocia, and Bithynia, fixing the capital city of their empire at Nice in the latter province. During all this time, the emperors of Constantinople, as well as their subjects, seemed to be in a manner intoxicated. No notice was taken of the great progress made by these barbarians. The generals were ambitious only of seizing the tottering empire, which seemed ready to fall a prey to the Turks; and, after it was obtained, spent their time in oppressing their subjects, rather than in making any attempts to repulse the enemy.\n\nAt last Alexius Comnenus, having wrested the empire from Nicephorus Botoniates, in 1077, began to prepare for opposing so formidable an enemy. But before he set out, as his soldiers had committed great outrages on his accession to the empire, he resolved to make confession of his sins, and do open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENANCE\">penance</a> for those he had suffered his army to commit. Accordingly he appeared in the attire of a penitent before the patriarch and several other ecclesiastics, acknowledged himself guilty of the many disorders that had been committed by his soldiers, and begged of the patriarch to impose upon him a penance suitable to the greatness of his crimes. The penance enjoined him and his adherents by the patriarch was to fast, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> upon the ground, and practise several other austerities for the space of 40 days. This command was religiously obeyed, and the emperor then began to prepare for war with so much vigour, that Solymon, the Turkish sultan, son and successor to Cutlu-Moles, dispatched ambassadors to Alexius with proposals of peace. These were at first rejected; but the emperor was at last glad to accept them, on certain advice that Robert Guiscard, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Puglia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALABRIA\">Calabria</a>, was making great preparations against him in the west.\n\nTo this expedition Robert was incited by Michael Robert Ducas. That prince had been deposed by Nicephorus Botoniates, and towards the end of the usurper's reign fled into the west, where he was received by emperor Robert, who was prevailed upon to favour his cause. For this purpose, Robert made great preparations; and these were continued even after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> of Botoniates. He failed with all his forces from Brundusium; and landing at Butthrotum in Epirus, made over into himself master of that place, while his son Bohemond, with part of the army reduced Aulon, a celebrated seaport and city in the country now called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBANIA\">Albania</a>.\n\nFrom thence they advanced to Dyrrhachium, which they invested both by sea and land; but met with a most vigorous opposition from George Paleologus, whom the emperor had entrusted with the defence of that important place. In spite of the utmost efforts of the enemy, this commander held out till the arrival of the Venetian fleet, by whom Robert's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>, commanded by Bohemond, was utterly defeated, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a> himself having narrowly escaped being taken prisoner. After this victory, the Venetians landed without loss of time, and being joined by Paleologus's men, fell upon Robert's troops with such fury, that they destroyed their works, burnt their engines, and forced them back to their camp in great disorder. As the Venetians were now masters at sea, the besieged were supplied with plenty of provisions, while a famine began to rage in the camp of the enemy; and this calamity was soon followed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>, which in the space of three months is said to have destroyed ten thousand men. Notwithstanding all these disasters, however, Robert did not abandon the siege; having found means to supply his famished troops with provisions, he continued it with such vigour, that the courage of the besieged began at last to fail them; and Paleologus sent repeated messages to the emperor, acquainting him that he would be obliged to surrender unless very speedily assisted. On this Alexius marched in person to the relief of the city, but was defeated with great loss by Robert. The whole right wing of Alexius's army, finding themselves hard pressed by the enemy, fled to a church dedicated to St Michael, imagining they would there find themselves in a place of safety; but the victorious army pursuing them, set fire to the church, which was burnt to ashes with all who were in it. The emperor himself with great difficulty made his escape, leaving the enemy masters of his camp and all his baggage. Soon after this defeat, the city surrendered; and Alexius being destitute of resources for carrying on the war, seized on the wealth of churches and monasteries, which gave much offence to the clergy, and had like to have occasioned great disturbances in the imperial city. At the same time, Alexius entering into an alliance with Henry emperor of Germany, petitioned\nCon\n\n[587]\n\nCon\n\nCon\n\nConstantinopolitan history.\n\npersuaded him to invade the dominions of Robert in Italy. At first Henry met with great success; but was soon overcome, and driven out of that country by Robert. Bohemond, in the mean time, reduced several places in Illyricum; and, having defeated Alexius in two pitched battles, entered Theissly, and sat down before Larissa. This place, being defended by an officer of great courage and experience in war, held out till the emperor came to its relief. Soon after his arrival, he found means to draw a strong party of Bohemond's men into an ambuscade, and cut them off almost entirely. However, in the battle which was fought a few days after, Bohemond had the advantage; but his troops mutinying and refusing to carry on the war, he was obliged to return to Italy. Alexius taking advantage of his absence, recovered several cities; and being informed that Robert was making great preparations against him, he had recourse once more to the Venetians. By them he was assisted with a powerful fleet, which defeated that of Robert in two engagements; but being soon after surprised by him, they were defeated with the loss of almost their whole navy. Robert is said to have used his victory with great barbarity, putting many of his prisoners to death with unheard-of torments. The Venetians equipped a second fleet; and joining that of the emperor, fell unexpectedly upon Robert's navy, who were riding without the least apprehensions in Butrintum, sunk most of his ships, and took a great number of prisoners, his wife and younger sons having narrowly escaped falling into their hands. Robert made great preparations to revenge this defeat; but was prevented by death from executing his designs; and, after his decease, his son Roger did not think proper to pursue so dangerous and expensive a war. He therefore recalled his troops, and the places which had been conquered by Robert and Bohemond submitted anew to the emperor.\n\nThis war was scarce ended, when the Scythians passing the Danube laid waste great part of Thrace, committing everywhere the greatest barbarities. Against them the emperor dispatched an army under the command of Pacurianus and Branas. The latter insisted upon engaging the enemy contrary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of his colleague; and his rashness caused the loss of the greater part of the army, who were cut off by the Scythians together with the two generals. Talius, an officer who had signalized himself on many occasions, was appointed to command the army in their room. He fell upon the enemy as they lay feebly in the neighbourhood of Philippopolis, cut great numbers of them in pieces, and obliged the rest to retire in great confusion. The following spring, however, they returned in such numbers, that the emperor resolved to march against them in person. Accordingly he set out for Adrianople, and from thence to a place called Lardea. Here, contrary to the advice of his best officers, he ventured a battle; in which he was utterly defeated with the loss of vast numbers of his men, he himself escaping with the utmost difficulty. The next year he was attended with no better success, his army being entirely defeated with the loss of his camp and baggage. In the year following, 1084, the emperor retrieved his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>; and gave the Scythians such an overthrow, that very few escaped the general slaughter. Notwithstanding this disaster, however, they again invaded the empire in 1093. To this they were encouraged by an impostor called Leo, who pretended to be the eldest son of Romanus Diogenes. The young prince had been slain in a battle with the Turks; but as the Scythians only wanted a pretence to renew the war, they received the impostor with joy. By a stratagem, however, Leo was murdered; and the Scythians being afterwards overthrown in two great battles, were obliged to submit on the emperor's own terms.\n\nSince the year 1083, the war had been carried on with the Turks with various success; but now an alliance was formed in the west against these infidels, which threatened the utter ruin of the Turkish nation. This was occasioned by the superstition of the Christians, who thought it a meritorious action to venture their lives for the recovery of the Holy Land, possessed at that time by the Turks and Saracens. Had the western princes been properly assisted by the emperors of the East in this undertaking, the Turks had undoubtedly been unable to resist them; but so far from this, the Latins were looked upon by them as no less enemies than the Turks; and indeed whatever places they took from the infidels, they never thought of restoring to the emperors of Constantinople, to whom they originally belonged, but erected a number of small independent principalities; which neither having sufficient strength to defend themselves, nor being properly supported by one another, soon became a prey to the Turks. In the year 1203 happened a dreadful fire at Constantinople, occasioned by some fire at Constantinople. These had plundered a mosque, which the Turks residing in Constantinople had been suffered to build there. For this reason they were attacked by the infidels; who being much superior to them in number, the Latins found themselves obliged to set fire to some houses, in order to make their escape with safety. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> spreading in an instant from street to street, reduced in a short time great part of the city to ashes, with the capacious store-houses which had been built at a vast expense on the quay. The late emperor Isaac Angelus, who had been restored to his throne by the Latins, died soon after their departure from Constantinople, leaving his son Alexius sole master of the empire. The young prince, to discharge the large sums he had promised the French and Venetians for their assistance, was obliged to lay heavy taxes on his subjects; and this, with the great esteem and friendship showed to his deliverers, raised a general discontent among the people of Constantinople, who were sworn enemies to the Latins. This encouraged John Ducas, surnamed Murzuphles, from his joined and thick eyebrows, to attempt the sovereignty. Unhappily he found means to put his treacherous designs in execution; and strangled the young prince with his own hands. After this he presented himself to the people; told them what he had done, which he had strangled in order to secure their liberties; and earnestly intreated them to choose an emperor who had courage enough to defend them against the Latins that were ready to oppress and enslave them. On this he was instantly saluted emperor by the inconstant multitude; but this usurpation proved the ruin of the city. The Latins immediately resolved to revenge\nthe death of the young prince; and, as they had been so often betrayed and retarded in their expeditions to the Holy Land by the emperors of Constantinople, to make themselves masters of that city, and seize the empire for themselves. In consequence of this revolution they muttered all their forces in Asia, and having crossed the straits, laid siege to Constantinople by sea and land. The tyrant, who was a man of great courage and experience in war, made a vigorous defense. The Latins, however, after having battered the walls for several days together with an incredible number of engines, gave a general assault on the 8th of April 1204. The attack lasted from break of day till three in the afternoon, when they were forced to retire, after having lost some of their engines, and a great number of men. The assault was nevertheless renewed four days after; when, after a warm dispute, the French planted their standard on one of the towers; which the Venetians observing, they quickly made themselves masters of four other towers, where they likewise displayed their ensigns. In the meantime three of the gates being broken down by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTERING\">battering</a> rams, and those who had scaled the walls having killed the guards, and opened the gates between the towers they had taken, the whole army entered, and drew up in battle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARRAY\">array</a> between the walls. The Greeks fled up and down in the greatest confusion; and several parties were by the Latins dispatched to scour the streets, who put all they met to the sword, without distinction of age or condition. Night put a stop to the dreadful slaughter, when the princes founding the retreat, placed their men in different quarters of the city, with orders to be upon their guard, not doubting but they should be attacked early next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>. They were surprised, however, at that time by the entire submission of the Greeks; to whom they promised their lives, but at the same time ordering them to retire to their houses, they gave up the city to be plundered by the soldiers for that day. They strictly enjoined their men to abstain from slaughter, to preserve the honour of the women, and to bring the whole booty into one place, that a just distribution might be made according to the rank and merit of each individual. The Greeks had undoubtedly concealed their most valuable effects during the night; many persons of the first rank had escaped, and carried along with them immense treasures; the soldiers had probably, as is usual in all such cases, reserved things of great value for themselves, notwithstanding all prohibitions to the contrary; and yet the booty, without the statues, pictures, and jewels, amounted to a sum almost incredible. As for Murtzouphlus, he made his escape in the night; embarking in a small vessel with Euphrosyne, the wife of Alexius Angelus a late usurper, and her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> Eudoxia, for whose sake he had abandoned his lawful wife.\n\nConstantinople continued subject to the Latins till the year 1261, when they were expelled by one Alexius Strategopulus. He was a person of an illustrious family; and, for his eminent services, distinguished with the title of Cesar. He had been sent against Alexius Angelus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESPOT\">despot</a> of Epirus, who now attempted to recover some places in Thessaly and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> from Michael Paleologus, one of the Greek emperors, that since the capture of Constantinople, had kept their court at Nice; and to try whether he could on his march surplice the imperial city itself. Alexius, having passed the straits, encamped at a place called Rhegium, where he was informed by the natives that a strong body of the Latins had been sent to the siege of Daphnius, that the garrison was in great want of provisions, and that it would be no difficult matter to surplice the city. Hereupon the Greek general resolved at all events to attempt it: in which he was encouraged by some of the inhabitants, who, coming privately to his camp, offered themselves to be his guides. He approached the walls in the dead of the night, which some of his men scaled without being observed; and, killing the sentries whom they found asleep, opened one of the gates to the rest of the army. The Greeks rushing in, put all they met to the sword; and at the same time, to create more terror, set fire to the city in four different places. The Latins, concluding from thence that the enemy's forces were far more numerous than they really were, did not so much as attempt either to drive them out or to extinguish the flames. In this general confusion, the emperor Baldwin, quitting the ensigns of majesty, fled with Justinian the Latin patriarch, and some of his intimate friends, to the sea-side; and there, embarking in a small vessel, sailed first to Eubrea, and afterwards to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>, leaving the Greeks in full possession of Constantinople. When news of this surprising and altogether unexpected success of Alexius were first brought to Paleologus, he could scarce give credit to it; but receiving soon after letters from Alexius himself, with a particular account of so memorable an event, he ordered public thanks to be returned in all the churches, appeared in public in his imperial robes, attended by the nobility in their best apparel, and ordered couriers to be dispatched with the agreeable news into all parts of the empire.\n\nSoon after, having settled his affairs at Nice, he set out for Constantinople with the empress, his son An- dronicus, the senate, and nobility, to take possession of the imperial city, and fix his residence in that place ty. that had originally been designed for the seat of the eastern empire. Having passed the straits, he advanced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> gate, and continued some days without the walls, while the citizens were busied in making the necessary preparations to receive him with a magnificence suitable to the occasion. On the day appointed, the golden gate, which had been long shut up, was opened, and the emperor entering it amidst the repeated acclamations of the multitude, marched on foot to the great palace. He was preceded by the bishop of Cyzicus, who carried an image of the Virgin Mary, supposed to have been done by St Luke, and followed by all the great officers, nobility, and chief citizens, pompously dressed. Public thanks were again returned in the church of St Sophia, at which the emperor assisted in person, with the clergy, the senate, and nobility. These exercises were succeeded by all sorts of rejoicings; after which the emperor carefully surveyed the imperial city. This survey greatly al-he restored layed his joy. He saw the stately palaces and other magnificent buildings of the Roman emperors lying in its former grandeur; the many capacious buildings that had been erected by his predecessors, at an immense charge, destroyed by fire, and other unavoidable accidents of war.\nwar; several streets abandoned by the inhabitants, and choaked up with rubbish, &c. These objects gave the emperor no small concern, and kindled in him a desire of restoring the city to its former lustre. In the mean time, looking upon Alexius as the restorer of his country, he caused him to be clad in magnificent robes; placed with his own hand a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> on his head; ordered him to be conducted through the city, as it were in triumph; decreed that for a whole year the name of Alexius should be joined in the public prayers with his own; and to perpetuate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of so great and glorious an action, he commanded his statue to be erected on a stately pillar of marble before the church of the Apostles. His next care was to re-populate the city, many Greek families having withdrawn from it while it was held by the Latins, and the Latins now preparing to return to their respective countries. The former were recalled home; and the latter, in regard of the great trade they carried on, were allowed many valuable privileges, which induced them not to remove. The Greeks were allowed to live in one of the most beautiful quarters of the city, to be governed by their own laws and magistrates, and to trade without paying customs or taxes of any kind. Great privileges were likewise granted to the natives of Venice and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PISA\">Pisa</a>, which encouraged them to lay aside all thoughts of removing; and the trade they carried on proved afterwards highly advantageous to the state.\n\nIt was not long, however, before these regulations were altered. The emperor being soon after informed that Baldwin, lately expelled from Constantinople, had married his daughter to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> king of Sicily, and given him, by way of dowry, the imperial city itself, he ordered the Genoese, who were become very numerous, to remove first to Heraclia, and afterwards to Galata, where they continued. As for the Pisans and Venetians, who were not so numerous and wealthy, they were allowed to continue in the city. Paleologus, though he had caused himself to be proclaimed emperor, and was possessed of absolute sovereignty, was as yet only guardian to the young emperor John Lascaris, then about 12 years of age. But having now settled the state, and having gained the affections both of natives and foreigners, he began to think of securing himself and his posterity in the full enjoyment of the empire; and for this reason cruelly ordered the eyes of the young prince to be put out, pretending that none but himself had any right to the city or empire of Constantinople, which he alone had recovered out of the hands of the Latins.\n\nThis piece of treachery and inhumanity involved him in great troubles. The patriarch immediately excommunicated him; and he would in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> have been driven from the throne by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of the western princes, had he not engaged Pope Urban IV., to espouse his cause, by promising to submit himself and his dominions to the Latin church. Thus, indeed, he diverted the present storm; but this proceeding caused the greatest disturbances, not only in Constantinople, but throughout the whole empire, nor was Paleologus able to reconcile his subjects to this union.\n\nIn 1283 Michael died, and was succeeded by his son Andronicus. His first step was to restore the ancient Greek ceremonies, thinking he could not begin his reign with a more popular act. But thus he involved himself in difficulties still greater than before. Though Michael had not been able fully to reconcile his Greek subjects to the Latin ceremonies, yet he had in some degree accomplished his purpose. The Latins had got a considerable footing in the city, and defended their ceremonies with great obstinacy; so that the empire was again thrown into a ferment by this imprudent step.\n\nAll this time the Turks had been continuing their War with encroachments on the empire, which, had it not been the Turks, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRUSADES\">crusades</a> published against them by the pope, they would in all probability have made themselves masters of before this time. They were now, however, very successfully opposed by Constantine the emperor's brother; but his valour rendered him suspected by the emperor; in consequence of which he was thrown into prison, along with several persons of great distinction. On the removal of this brave commander, the Turks, under the famous Othoman, made themselves masters of several places in Phrygia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARIA\">Caria</a>, and Bitium; and, among the rest, of the city of Nice. To put a stop to their conquests, the emperor dispatched against them Philanthropenus and Libadarius, two officers of great experience in war. The former gained some advantages over the enemy; but being elated with his success, caused himself to be proclaimed emperor. This rebellion, however, was soon suppressed, Philanthropenus being betrayed by his own men; but the Turks taking advantage of these intestine commotions, not only extended their dominions in Asia, but conquered most of the islands in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>; and, being masters at sea, infested the coasts of the empire, to the utter ruin of trade and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>.\n\nFrom this time the Roman empire tended fast to dissolution. After the revolt of Philanthropenus, the emperor could no longer trust his subjects, and therefore hired the Mamelukes to assist him; but they, behaving in a careless manner, were first defeated by their enemies, and afterwards turned their arms against those they came to assist. He next applied to the Catalans, who behaved in the same manner; and having ravaged the few places left the emperor in Asia, returned into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, and called the Turks to their assistance.\n\nThis happened in the year 1292, and was the first appearance of the Turks in Europe. This enterprise, however, was unsuccessful. Having loaded themselves in Europe with booty, they offered to depart quietly if they were allowed a safe passage, and ships to transport them to Asia. To this the emperor, willing to get rid of such troublesome guests, readily consented, and ordered the vessels to be got ready with all possible expedition. But the Greek officers observing the immense booty with which they were loaded, resolved to fall upon them in the night, and cut them all off at once. This scheme, however, was not managed with such secrecy but that the Turks had notice of it, and therefore prepared for their defence. They first surprized a strong castle in the neighbourhood, and then found means to acquaint their countrymen in Asia with their dangerous situation. Their brethren, enticed with the hopes of booty, were not long in coming to their assistance; and having crossed the Hellespont in great numbers,\nravaged the adjacent country, making excursions to the very gates of Constantinople. At last the emperor determined to root them out; and accordingly marched against them with all his forces, the country people flocking to him from all quarters. The Turks at first gave themselves over for lost; but finding the Greeks negligent of discipline, they attacked their army unexpectedly, utterly defeated it, and made themselves masters of the camp. After this unexpected victory, they continued for two years to ravage Thrace in the most terrible manner. At last, however, they were defeated; and being afterwards shut up in the Cheroneus, they were all cut in pieces or taken.\n\nSoon after new commotions took place in this unhappy empire, of which the Turks did not fail to take the advantage. In 1327 they made themselves masters of most of the cities on the Maeander; and, among the rest, of the strong and important city of Prusa in Bithynia. The next year, however, Othoman, who may justly be styled the founder of the Turkish monarchy, being dead, the emperor laid hold of that opportunity to recover Nice, and some other important places, from the infidels. But these were lost the year following, together with Abydos and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NICOMEDIA\">Nicomedia</a>; and in 1330 a peace was concluded upon condition that they should keep all their conquests. This peace they observed no longer than served their own purposes; for new commotions breaking out in the empire, they pursued their conquests, and by the year 1357 had reduced all Asia. They next passed the Hellespont under the conduct of Soliman the son, or, as others will have it, the brother of Orchan, the successor of Othoman, and seized on a strong castle on the European side. Soon after the Turkish sultan died, and was succeeded by Amurath. He extended the conquests of his predecessors, and in a short time reduced all Thrace, making Adrianople the seat of his empire. Amurath was slain by treachery in a little time after, and was succeeded by his son Bajazet. This prince greatly enlarged his dominions by new conquests. In a short time he reduced the countries of Thessaly, Macedon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHOCIS\">Phocis</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PELOPONNESUS\">Peloponnesus</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MYSIA\">Mysia</a>, and Bulgaria, driving out the despots or petty princes who ruled there. Elevated with his frequent victories, he began to look upon the Greek emperor, to whom nothing was now left but the city of Constantinople and the neighbouring country, as his vassal. Accordingly he sent him an arrogant and haughty message, commanding him to pay a yearly tribute, and send his son Manuel to attend him in his military expeditions. This demand the emperor was obliged to comply with, but died soon after, in the year 1392.\n\nManuel no sooner heard of his father's death than he hastened to Constantinople, without taking leave of the sultan, or acquainting him with the reason of his sudden departure. At this Bajazet was so highly offended, that he passed with great expedition out of Bithynia into Thrace, ravaged the country adjoining to Constantinople, and at last invested the city itself both by sea and land. In this extremity Manuel had recourse to the western princes; who sent him an army of 130,000 men, under the command of Sigismund king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUNGARY\">Hungary</a>, and John count of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEVERS\">Nevers</a>. But though the western troops proved at first successful, they were in the end defeated with great slaughter by Bajazet, who then returned to the siege with greater vigour than ever. As he found, however, that the citizens were determined to hold out to the last, he applied to John, the son of Manuel's elder brother, who had a better title to the crown than Manuel himself. With him he entered into a private agreement, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of which Bajazet was to place John upon the throne of Constantinople; on the other hand, John was to deliver up the city to the Turks, and remove the imperial city to Peloponnesus, which the sultan promised to relinquish to him and his posterity. At the same time, he sent deputies to the inhabitants of Constantinople, offering to withdraw his army, and cease from further hostilities, provided they expelled Manuel and placed John upon the throne. This proposal rent the city into two factions; but Manuel prevented the mischiefs which were ready to ensue, by a voluntary resignation, upon condition that he should be allowed to retire to whatever place he thought proper with his wife and children.\n\nWith this condition John readily complied; and Manuel having received him into the city, and conducted him to the palace, set sail for Venice. From thence he went to the courts of all the western princes, to solicit their assistance against the Turks, whose power was grown formidable to all Europe. He was everywhere received with the greatest demonstrations of esteem, and promised large supplies; all Christendom being now alarmed at the progress of the infidels.\n\nIn the mean time, Bajazet did not fail to put John in mind of his promise; but the citizens refusing to comply with such a scandalous treaty, the siege was renewed, and the city assaulted with more fury than ever. When it was already reduced to the last extremity, news were brought the sultan that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAMERLANE\">Tamerlane</a>, the victorious Tartar, having overrun all the east with incredible celerity, had now turned his arms against the Turks, and was preparing to break into Syria. Bajazet, alarmed at the danger that threatened him, raised the siege in great haste, and advanced against Tamerlane. He is described with a very numerous and well disciplined army; but defeated and taken prisoner by Tamerlane.\n\nBut this relief was of short duration. In 1424 the city was again besieged by Amurath II. The inhabitants defended themselves with great bravery; but mult in the end have submitted, had not the emperor prevailed upon the prince of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARAMANIA\">Caramania</a> to countenance an impostor and pretender to the Turkish throne. This obliged Amurath to raise the siege, and march with all his forces against the usurper, whom he soon reduced. Having then no other enemies to contend with, he entered Macedon at the head of a powerful army; and having ravaged the country far and near, he took and plundered Theilalonica, as he did also most of the cities of Aetolia, Phocis, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOEOTIA\">Boeotia</a>. From Greece he marched into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVIA\">Servia</a>; which country he soon reduced. He next broke into the dominions of the king of Hungary, and besieged the strong city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELGRADE\">Belgrade</a>; but here he met with a vigorous repulse, no fewer than 15,000 Turks being slain by the Christians in one fall, which obliged the sultan to drop the enterprise and retire.\nIn his retreat he was attacked by the celebrated John Hunniades, who cut great numbers of his men in pieces, and obliged the rest to fly with precipitation. Not long after he gained a still more complete victory over the enemy in the plains of Transylvania, with the loss of only 3000 of his own men, whereas 20,000 of the Turks were killed on the field of battle, and almost an equal number in the pursuit. Amurath, who was then at Adrianople, sent an army into Transylvania far more numerous than the former; but they were attended with no better success, being cut off almost to a man by the brave Hungarian. He gained several other victories no less remarkable; but was at last entirely defeated in 1448; and with this defeat ended all hopes of preserving the Roman empire. The unhappy emperor was now obliged to pay an annual tribute of 300,000 ducats to the sultan; and to yield up to him some strong holds which he still held on the Euxine sea. However, as he doubted not but Amurath would soon attempt to become master of the city itself, he renewed the union between the Greek and Latin churches, hoping that this would induce the western princes to assist him in the defence of the city against the Turks. This union produced great disturbances, which the emperor did not long survive, but died in 1448, leaving the empire, now confined within the walls of Constantinople, to his brother Constantine.\n\nAmurath the Turkish sultan died in 1450, and was succeeded by his son Mohammed. In the beginning of his reign he entered into an alliance with Constantine, and pretended a great desire to live in friendship with him and the other Christian princes; but no sooner had he put an end to a war in which he was engaged with Ibrahim king of Caramania, than he built a strong fort on the European side of the Bosphorus, opposite to another in Asia; in both of which he placed strong garrisons. These two castles commanded the straits; and the former being but five miles from the city, kept it in a manner blocked up. This soon produced a misunderstanding between him and the emperor, which ended in the siege of the city. The siege commenced on the fifth of April 1453. Mohammed's numerous forces covering the plains before it on the land-side, and a fleet of 300 sail blocking it up by sea. The emperor, however, had taken care to secure the haven, in which were three large ships, 20 small ones, and a great number of galleys, by means of a chain drawn across the entrance. Mohammed began the siege by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTING\">planting</a> batteries as near the city as he could, and raising mounts in several places as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as the walls themselves, whence the besieged were incessantly galled with showers of arrows. He had in his camp a piece of ordnance of prodigious size, which is said to have carried a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> of 100 pounds weight made of hard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> brought from the Euxine sea. With this vast piece the enemy made several breaches in the walls; which, however, were repaired with incredible expedition by the besieged. But Mohammed, the better to carry on the siege, caused new levies to be made throughout his extensive dominions, by which his army was soon increased to near 400,000 men; while the garrison consisted only of 9000 regular troops, viz. 6000 Greeks and 3000 Genoese and Venetians. As the enemy continued to batter the walls day and night without intermission, a great part of them was at last beaten down; but while the Turks were busy in filling up the ditch, in order to give the assault, a new wall was built. This threw the tyrant into a prodigious rage, which was greatly heightened when he saw his whole fleet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-WORSTED\">worsted</a> by five ships, four of which were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with corn from Peloponnesus, and the other with all manner of provisions from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of Chios. The enemy opened themselves a way through the whole Turkish fleet; and, to the inexpressible joy of the Christians, at last got safe into the harbour.\n\nThe Turks attempted several times to force the haven; but all their efforts proving ineffectual, Mohammed formed a design of conveying 80 galleys over land into the haven for the space of eight miles into it. This he accomplished by means of certain engines, the contrivance of a renegade; and having then either taken or sunk all the ships contained in it, he caused a bridge to be built over it with surprising expedition. By this means the city was laid open to an assault from that side likewise. The place was now assaulted on all sides; and Constantine being well apprised that he could not long hold out against such a mighty fleet and so numerous an army, sent deputies to Mohammed offering to acknowledge himself his vassal, by paying him yearly what tribute he should think proper to impose, provided he raised the siege and withdrew. The tyrant answered that he was determined at all events to become master of the city: but if the emperor delivered it up forthwith, he would yield up to him Peloponnesus, and other provinces to his brothers, which they should enjoy peaceably as his friends and allies; but if he held out to the last extremity, and suffered it to be taken by assault, he would put him and the whole nobility to the sword, abandon the city to be plundered by his soldiers, and carry the inhabitants into captivity.\n\nThis condition was hastily rejected by the emperor; who thereby involved himself and all his subjects in the most terrible calamity. The siege was renewed with more vigour than ever, and continued till the 29th of May; when a report being spread in the Turkish camp that a mighty army was advancing in full march to the relief of the city under the conduct of the celebrated John Hunniades, the common soldiery, seized with a panic, began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTINY\">mutiny</a>, and press Mohammed in a tumultuous manner to break up the siege. Nay, they openly threatened him with death, if he did not immediately abandon the enterprise and retire from before the city, which they despaired of being able to reduce before the arrival of the supposed succours. Mohammed was upon the point of complying with their demand, when he was advised by Zagan, a Turkish officer of great intrepidity, and an irreconcilable enemy to the Christian name, to give without loss of time a general assault. To this he said the soldiery, however mutinous, would not be averse, provided the sultan solemnly promised to abandon the city to be plundered by them. As such an advice best suited the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> of Mohammed, he readily embraced it; and caused a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a> to be published throughout the camp, declaring, that he gave up to his soldiers all the wealth of that opulent city, requiring to himself only the empty house.\nThe desire of plunder soon got the better of that fear which had seized the Turkish army; and they unanimously desired to be led on to the attack. Hereupon Constantine was summoned for the last time to deliver up the city, with a promise of his life and liberty; but to this he answered, that he was unalterably determined either to defend the city or to perish with it. The attack began at three in the morning on Tuesday the 29th of May; such troops were first employed as the sultan valued least, and despaired them for no other purpose than to tire the Christians, who made a prodigious havoc of that disorderly multitude. After the carnage had lasted some hours, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JANIZARIES\">Janizaries</a> and other fresh troops advanced in good order, and renewed the attack with incredible vigour. The Christians, summoning all their courage and resolution, twice repulsed the enemy: but being in the end quite spent, they were no longer able to stand their ground; so that the enemy in several places broke into the city. In the mean time Justinian, the commander of the Genoese and a select body of Greeks, having received two wounds, one in the thigh and the other in the hand, was so disheartened, that he caused himself to be conveyed to Galata, where he soon after died of grief. His men, dismayed at the sudden flight of their general, immediately quitted their posts and fled in the utmost confusion. However, the emperor, attended with a few of the most resolute among the nobility, still kept his post, striving with unparalleled resolution to oppose the multitude of barbarians that now broke in from every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>. But being in the end overpowered with numbers, and seeing all his friends lie dead on the ground, \"What! (cried he aloud) is there no Christian left alive to strike off my head?\" He had scarce uttered these words, when one of the enemy, not knowing him, gave him a deep cut across the face with his sabre; and at the same time, another coming behind him, with a blow on the back part of his head laid him dead on the ground. After the death of the emperor, the few Christians that were left alive betook themselves to flight; and the Turks, meeting with no further opposition, entered the city, which they filled with blood and slaughter. They gave no quarter, but put all they met to the sword, without distinction. Many thousands took refuge in the church of St Sophia, but they were all massacred in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a> by the enraged barbarians; who, prompted by their natural cruelty, the desire of revenge, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of booty, spared no place nor person. Most of the nobility were, by the sultan's orders, cut off, and the rest kept for purposes more grievous than death itself. Many of the inhabitants, among whom were some men of great learning, found means to make their escape while the Turks were busy in plundering the city. Thele embarking on five ships then in the harbour, arrived safe in Italy; where, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the Greek tongue, they revived the liberal sciences, which had long been neglected in the west. After the expiration of three days, Mohammed commanded his soldiers to forbear all further hostilities on pain of death: and then put an end to as cruel a pillage and massacre as any mentioned in history. The next day he made his public and triumphal entry into Constantinople, and chose it for the seat of the Turkish empire, which it has continued to be ever since.\n\nThis city is now called by the Turks Istanbul, and by the Greeks Istanboli or Stanboli. It is situated at the eastern extremity of Romania, on a small neck of land which advances towards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATOLIA\">Natolia</a>, from which it is separated by a channel of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> in breadth. The sea of Marmora washes its walls on the south, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> of the channel of Constantinople does the same on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>. It is delightfully situated between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK_SEA\">Black sea</a> and the Archipelago, from whence it is supplied with all necessaries. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> seignior's palace, called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERAGLIO\">Seraglio</a>, is seated on the sea side, and is surrounded with walls flanked with towers, and separated from the city by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>. It is said the harbour will easily hold 1200 ships. The number of houses must needs be prodigious, since one fire has burnt down 30,000 in a day, without greatly changing the aspect of the city. However, in general, they are but mean, especially on the outside, where there are few or no windows; and the streets being narrow, gives them a melancholy look. They reckon that there are 3770 streets, small and great; but they are seldom or never clean; and the people are infected with the plague almost every year. The inhabitants are half Turks, two-thirds of the other half Christians, and the rest Jews. Here are a great number of ancient monuments still remaining, and particularly the superb temple of Sophia, which is turned into a mosque, and far surpasses all the rest. The street called Adriano is the longest and broadest in the city; and the bazars, or bazaars, are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> for selling all sorts of merchandise. The old and the new are pretty near each other; and are large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> buildings, covered with domes, and supported by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> and pilasters. The new is the best, and contains all sorts of goods which are there exposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>. The market for slaves, of both sexes, is not far off; and the Jews are the principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, who bring them here to be sold. There are a great number of young girls brought from Hungary, Greece, Candia, Ruffia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINGRELIA\">Mingrelia</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEORGIA\">Georgia</a>, for the service of the Turks, who generally buy them for their seraglios. The great square, near the mosque of Sultan Bajazet, is the place for public diversions, where the jugglers and mountebanks play a great variety of tricks. The circumference of this city is by some said to be 15 miles, and by Mr Tournefort 23 miles; to which if we add the suburbs, it may be 34 miles in compass. The suburb called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERA\">Pera</a> is charmingly situated; and is the place where the ambassadors of England, France, Venice, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, reside. This city is built in the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a>; and as the ground rises gradually, there is a view of the whole town from the sea. The public buildings, such as the palaces, the mosques, bagnios, and caravansaries for the entertainment of strangers, are many of them very magnificent. E. Long. 29. 20. N.

This, however, is certain, that it was to this feast all his neighbours were invited; when, taking advantage of the solemnities and sacrifices, he seized the women. To draw the greater concourse of people, he gave out, that he had found an altar hid under ground, which he intended to consecrate, with sacrifices to the god to whom it had been originally erected.

They were two in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, called consuls a confundendo, and annually chosen in the Campus Martius. The two first consuls were L. Jun. Brutus, and L. Tarquinius Collatinus, chosen in the year of Rome 244, after the expulsion of the Tarquins. In the first times of the republic the two consuls were always chosen from patrician families <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> noblemen, but the people obtained the privilege in the year of Rome 388, of electing one of the consuls from their own body, and sometimes both were plebeians. The first consul among the plebeians was L. Sextius. It was required that every candidate for the consulship should be 43 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, called legitimum tempus. He was always to appear at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> as a private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> without a retinue,\nConsul. retinue, and it was requisite before he canvassed for the office to have discharged the functions of quaestor, edile, and praetor. Sometimes these qualifications were disregarded. Val. Corvinus was made a consul in his 23rd year, and Scipio in his 24th. Young Marius, Pompey, and Augustus, were also under the proper age, when they were invested with the office, and Pompey had never been quaestor or praetor. The power of the consuls was unbounded, and they knew <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> superior but the gods and the laws; but after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> of their office their conduct was minutely scrutinized by the people, and misbehaviour was often punished by the laws. The badge of their office was the praetexta, a robe fringed with purple, afterwards exchanged for the toga picta or palmata. They were preceded by 12 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LICTORS\">lictors</a> carrying the fasces or bundles of sticks, in the middle of which appeared an axe. The axe, as being the characteristic rather of tyranny than of freedom, was taken away from the fasces by Valerius Poplicola, but it was restored by his successor. They took it by turns monthly to be preceded by the lictors while at Rome, lest the appearance of two persons with the badges of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> authority should raise apprehensions in the multitude. While one appeared publicly in state, only a crier walked before the other, and the lictors followed behind without the fasces. Their authority was equal; yet the Valerian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> gave the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of priority to the older, and the Julian law to him who had most children; and he was generally called consul <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">major</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a>. As their power was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a>, they presided over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>, and could convene and dismiss it at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. The senators were their counsellors; and among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> the manner of reckoning their years was by the name of the consuls, and by M. Tull. Cicerone et L. Antonio Consulibus, for instance, the year of Rome 689 was always understood. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> lasted from the year of Rome 244 till the 1294, or 541st year of the Christian era. In public assemblies the consuls sat in ivory chairs, and held in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> an ivory wand called scipio eburneus, which had an eagle on its top as a sign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> and power. When they had drawn by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> the provinces over which they were to preside during their consulship, they went to the capitol to offer their prayers to the gods, and intreat them to protect the republic; after this they departed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> arrayed in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> dress and preceded by the lictors. Sometimes the provinces were assigned them without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> by lot, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> and appointment of the senators. At their departure they were provided by the state with whatever was requisite during their expedition. In their provinces they were both attended by the 12 lictors, and equally invested with regal authority. They were not permitted to return to Rome without the special command of the senate; and they always remained in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> till the arrival of their successor. At their return they harangued the people, and solemnly protested that they had done nothing against the laws or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, but had faithfully and diligently endeavoured to promote the greatness and welfare of the state. No man could be consul two following years; yet this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> was sometimes broken, and we find Marius re-elected consul after the expiration of his office during the Cimbrian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>. The office of consul, so dignified during the times of the commonwealth, became a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> under the emperors, and retained nothing of its authority but the useless ensigns of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> dignity. Even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of the office, which was originally annual, was reduced to two or three months by J. Caesar; but they who were admitted on the first of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> denominated the year, and were called ordinarii. Their successors during the year were distinguished by the name of suffecti. Tiberius and Claudius abridged the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the consulship; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Commodus made no less than 25 consuls in one year.

But from the means which have been effectually employed either to abate its virulence or to destroy it entirely, this matter may be fairly inferred to be of a chemical nature. We have already detailed the effects of the fumes of muriatic acid in purifying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> of Dijon, which were successfully used by Morveau in\n1773. Pursuing this hint, no doubt, Dr Carmichael Smyth proposed the fumes of nitric acid. This was tried on board different ships at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHEERNESS\">Sheerness</a> about the year 1796; and being found to answer the purpose of destroying the contagion which then prevailed, Dr Smyth afterwards received a liberal reward from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> for his discovery. These experiments were conducted on board the Union <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a> ship by Mr Macnies surgeon of the Discovery, and Mr Baffin surgeon of the Union. The wards at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> were very much crowded with patients; and of 200 sick on board, 150 were in different stages of a malignant, contagious fever, which made a very rapid progress, and produced very fatal effects on the attendants and ship's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>.\n\nThe materials and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> employed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> were the following: A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, two dozen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUART\">quart</a> earthen pipkins, as many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>-cups, some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> flaps of glass to be used as spatulas, a quantity of concentrated sulphuric acid, and a quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALTPETRE\">saltpetre</a> (nitrate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POTASH\">potash</a>).\n\nThe process was conducted in the following manner:\n\n1st. All the ports and scuttles were shut up; the sand, previously heated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> pots, was scooped out into the pipkins with an iron ladle; and in this heated sand, in each pipkin, a small tea-cup was immersed, containing about half an ounce of sulphuric acid, to which, after it had acquired a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, an equal quantity of nitrate of potash in powder was gradually added, and the mixture stirred with a glass spatula till the vapour arose from it in considerable quantity. The pipkins were then carried through the wards by the nurses and convalescents, who kept walking about with them in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, occasionally putting them under the cradles of the sick, and in every corner where any foul air was suspected to lodge. In this manner they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> fumigating, until the whole space between decks, fore and aft, was filled with the vapour, which appeared like a thick haze.\n\nThe vapour at first excited coughing among the patients, which gradually ceased as it became more generally diffused through the wards: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of this effect, however, was to be attributed to the inattention of those who carried the pipkins, in putting them too near the faces of the sick; which caused them to inhale the strong vapour as it immediately issued from the cups.\n\nThe body-clothes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>-clothes of the sick were, as much as possible, exposed to the nitrous vapour during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUMIGATION\">fumigation</a>; and all the foul <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> removed from them was immediately immersed in a tub of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, afterwards carried on deck, rinsed out, and hung up till nearly dry, and then fumigated before it was taken to the wash-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>; a precaution extremely necessary in every case of infectious disorder. Proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> was also paid to cleanliness and ventilation.\n\nThree hours were at first found necessary to fumigate the ship. In about an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> after, the vapour having entirely subsided, the ports and scuttles were thrown open for the admission of fresh air. It could plainly be perceived that the air of the hospital was greatly sweetened even after this first fumigation. The process was repeated again next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>; and the people employed, being now more expert, finished the whole in about an hour's time. In an hour afterwards, the vapour having entirely subsided, the fresh air was freely admitted into the hospital as before. Fewer pipkins were employed for the evening fumigations than for those of the mornings, as the fresh air could not be admitted so freely after the former as the latter.\n\nThe pleasing and immediate effect of the fumigation in destroying the offensive and disagreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, arising from so many sick crowded together, was now very perceptible, even to the attendants; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which was, that they began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> some degree of confidence in its efficacy, and approached the cradles of the infected with less dread of being attacked with the disorder: thus the sick were better attended, and the duty of the hospital was more regularly and more cheerfully performed.\n\nFrom the 26th of November 1795, when the fumigation was first reported to, till the 25th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>, not a person on board was attacked with the fever, though, in the three months preceding, more than one third of all the people in the ship had been seized with the distemper, and of these more than one in four were carried off by it; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> is, that the sicknesses and mortality would have gone on, increasing in proportion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> of the contagion, and to the increasing despondency of the people, who considered themselves as so many devoted victims.\n\nThe advantage of the fumigation was not felt by the ship's company and attendants alone, whom it prevented from the baneful effects of the fever: the sick and convalescents derived almost an equal benefit from it. The symptoms of the disease became milder, and lost much of their malignant appearance; and the advantage of a pure and sweet air to convalescents must be obvious.\n\nGreat confidence is always dangerous. It proved so on the present occasion. On the 17th of December they imagined themselves so secure, that they discontinued the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of fumigating morning and evening, thinking that once a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> was sufficient. On the 25th, one of the nurses suffered a flight attack; and on the 26th a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a>, who, for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> before, had been in a state of intoxication, was seized with the fever, and died. These two accidents gave immediate alarm; they returned again to the practice of fumigating twice a day; and from that time to the extermination of the disorder, there was not an instance of a person suffering from contagion on board the ship.\n\nThe success of the experiment was not confined to the Union: the power of the nitrous vapour to destroy contagion was equally displayed on board some Russian ships then in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWNS\">Downs</a>. The safety, too, with which it may be employed, in any situation, without inconvenience or risk of fire, is another great recommendation in its favour.\n\nIt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not be difficult from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> to employ this kind of fumigation. It is only necessary to observe, for the sake of those who may not be versant in chemical pursuits, that the ingredients ought to be pure, and neither metal vessels nor rods should be used. Any kind of metal getting among the ingredients would cause the vapour to be very noxious instead of salutary. The fumes that rise should be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they are of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, there is reason to suspect the purity of the ingredients.\n\nThe importance of this discovery need not be insisted on;\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">Contemplation</a>: it is equally applicable to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of putrid contagion, even to the plague itself.

Scipio the younger, when only 24 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, was appointed by the Roman republic to the command of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> against the Spaniards. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> and valour would have done <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to the most experienced general. Determined to strike an important blow, he formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of besieging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARTHAGENA\">Carthagena</a>, then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of the Carthaginian empire in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> were so judiciously concerted, and with so much courage and intrepidity pursued, both by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, that notwithstanding a bold and vigorous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, the capital was taken by storm. The plunder was immense. Ten thousand free-men were made prisoners; and above 300 more, of both sexes, were received as hostages. One of the latter, a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>, the wife of Mandonius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> of Indibilis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of the Ilergetes, watching her opportunity, came out of the crowd, and throwing herself at the conqueror's feet, conjured him, with tears in her eyes, to recommend to those who had the ladies in their keeping to have regard to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a> and birth. Scipio, who did not understand her meaning at first, assured her that he had given orders that they should not want for anything. But the lady replied, \"Those conveniences are not what affect us. In the condition to which fortune hath reduced us, with what ought we not to be contented! I have many other apprehensions, when I consider, on one side, the licentiousness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>; and on the other, the youth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of the princesses which you see here before us; for as to me, my age protects me from all fear in this respect.\" She had with her the daughters of Indibilis, and several other ladies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, all in the flower of youth, who considered her as their mother. Scipio then comprehending what the subject of her fear was, \"My own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> (says he), and that of the Roman people, are concerned in not suffering that virtue, which ought always to be respected wherever we find it, should be exposed in my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a> to a treatment unworthy of it. But you give me a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> for being more strict in my care of it, in the virtuous solicitude you show in thinking only of the preservation of your honour, in the midst of so many other objects of fear.\" After this conversation, he committed the care of the ladies to some officers of experienced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, strictly commanding that they should treat them with all the respect they could pay to the mothers, wives, and daughters, of their allies and particular friends. It was not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before Scipio's integrity and virtue were put to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>. Being retired in his camp, some of his officers brought him a young virgin of such exquisite beauty, that she drew upon her the eyes and admiration of everybody. The young conqueror started from his seat with confusion and surprise; and, like one thunderstruck, seemed to be robbed of that presence of mind and self-possession so necessary in a general, and for which\nContinence, which Scipio was remarkably famous. In a few moments, having rallied his straggling spirits, he inquired of the beautiful captive, in the most civil and polite manner, concerning her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, birth, and connections; and finding that she was betrothed to a Celtiberian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> named Allucius, he ordered both him and the captive's parents to be sent for. The Spanish prince no sooner appeared in his presence, than, even before he spoke to the father and mother, he took him aside; and, to remove the anxiety he might be in on account of the young lady, he addressed him in these words: \"You and I are young, which admits of my speaking to you with more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>. Those who brought me your future spouse, assured me, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, that you loved her with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> tenderness; and her beauty left me no room to doubt it. Upon which reflecting, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a>, like you, I had thought on making an engagement, and were not wholly engrossed with the affairs of my country, I should desire that so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> and legitimate a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> should find favour, I think myself happy in the present conjuncture to do you this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. Though the fortune of war has made me your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, I desire to be your friend. Here is your wife: take her, and may the gods bless you with her. One thing, however, I would have you be fully assured of, that she has been amongst us as would have been in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of her father and mother. Far be it from Scipio to purchase a loose and momentary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> at the expense of virtue, honour, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of an honest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>. No; I have kept her for you, in order to make you a present worthy of you and of me. The only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> I require of you for this ineffable gift is, that you would be a friend to the Roman people.\" Allucius's heart was too full to make him any answer; but throwing himself at the general's feet, he wept aloud. The captive lady fell into the same posture; and remained so, till the father burst out into the following words: \"Oh! divine Scipio! the gods have given you more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> virtue! Oh! glorious leader! Oh! wondrous youth! does not that obliged virgin give you, while she prays to the gods for your prosperity, raptures above all the transports you could have reaped from the possession of her injured person?\"\n\nThe relations of the young lady had brought with them a very considerable sum for her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RANSOM\">ransom</a>; but when they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> that she was restored to them in so generous and godlike a manner, they intreated the conqueror, with great earnestness, to accept that sum as a present; and declared, by his complying, that new favour would complete their joy and gratitude. Scipio, not being able to refuse such warm and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> solicitation, told them that he accepted the gift; and ordered it to be laid at his feet; then addressing himself to Allucius, \"I add (says he) to the portion which you are to receive from your father-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> this sum; which I desire you to accept as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>-present.\"\n\nIf we consider that Scipio was at this time in the prime of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, unmarried, and under no restraint, we cannot but acknowledge, that the conquest he made of himself was far more glorious than that of the Carthaginian empire: and though his treatment of this captive prince was not more delicate and generous than what might justly be expected from a person endowed with reason and reflection; yet conferring how few there are in his circumstances who would have acted as he did, we cannot but applaud his conduct, and propose him as a suitable example to future ages. Nor was his virtue unrewarded. The young prince, charmed with the liberality and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a> of Scipio, went into his country to publish the praises of so generous a victor. He cried out, in the transports of his gratitude, \"That there was come into Spain a young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> like the gods; who conquered all things less by the force of his arms than the charms of his virtue and the greatness of his beneficence.\" Upon this report all Celtiberia submitted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>; and Allucius returned in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOUT\">shout</a> to Scipio, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of 1400 chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, to facilitate his future conquests.\n\nTo render the marks of his gratitude still more durable, Allucius caused the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> we have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> related to be engraved on a silver shield, which he presented to Scipio, a present infinitely more estimable and glorious than all his treasures and triumphs. The buckler, which Scipio carried with him when he returned to Rome, was lost, in passing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RHONE\">Rhone</a>, with part of the baggage. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in that river till the year 1665, when some fishermen found it. It was, before the revolution, in the king of France's cabinet.\n\n2. The circumstance which raises Alexander the Great above many conquerors, and, as it were, above himself, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> he made of his victory after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUS\">Issus</a>. This is the most beautiful incident in his life. It is the point of view in which it is his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> to be considered; and it is impossible for him not to appear truly great in that view. By the victory of Issus he became possessed of the whole Persian empire; not only Syagambis, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DARIUS\">Darius</a>'s mother, was his captive, but also his wife and daughters, princesses whose beauty was not to be equalled in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>. Alexander, like Scipio, was in the bloom of life, a conqueror, free, and not yet engaged in matrimony; nevertheless, his camp was to those princesses a sacred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> rather a temple, in which their chastity was secured as under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> of virtue itself; and so highly revered, that Darius, in his expiring moments, hearing the kind treatment they had met with, could not help lifting up his dying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> towards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, and wishing success to his wife and generous a conqueror, who could govern his passions at so critical a time. Plutarch informs us more particularly, that the princesses lived so retired in the camp, according to their own desire, that they were not seen by any person except their own attendants; nor did any other person dare to approach their apartments. After the first visit, which was a respectful and ceremonious one, Alexander, to avoid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> himself to the dangers of human frailty, made a solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> never to visit Darius's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> any more. He himself informs us of this memorable circumstance, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> written by him to Parmenio, in which he commanded him to put to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> certain Macedonians who had forced the wives of some foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>. In this letter was the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAGRAPH\">paragraph</a>: \"For as to myself, it will be found that I neither saw nor would see the wife of Darius; and did not suffer any one to speak of her beauty before me.\"\n\n3. Hecat\u00e6us informs us, that Nicocles, king of Salamin, gloried in never having known any woman besides\nContinence, sides his wife; and was amazed that all other contracts of civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> should be treated with due regard, whilst that of marriage, the most sacred and inviolable of obligations, was broken through with impunity; and that men should not blush to commit an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDELITY\">infidelity</a> with respect to their wives, of which, should their wives be guilty, it would throw them into the utmost anguish and fury.\n\n4. Henry VI., king of England, though unhappy in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, was nevertheless possessed of many virtues. He was so remarkable for his chastity, that before his marriage he would not allow any lady of a suspicious character and unguarded conduct to frequent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>: and having observed one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> some ladies with their bosoms uncovered, he turned away his eyes from the indecent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, and reprimanded them smartly in the simple dialect of the times; \"Fy, fy (said he), for shame; forsooth ye be to blame.\"\n\n5. In the reign of King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> II., when licentiousness was at its height in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, a yeomen of the guards refused the mistress of a king. The lady, who was dissatisfied with her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> lover, had fixed her eyes upon this man, and thought she had no more to do than speak her pleasure. He got out of her way. He refused to understand her; and when the prelief him further, he said, \"I am married.\" The story reached the king, with all its circumstances; but they who expected an extravagant laugh upon the occasion were disappointed. He sent for the person: he found him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, though reduced to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> station; and \"Odds fish, man (says he), though I am not honest enough to be virtuous myself, I value them that are.\" He gave him an appointment, and respected him for life.\n\n6. In many parts the poorest people are the most virtuous and honest in this respect. In the Swede's dominion, towards the pole, there is no name for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADULTERY\">adultery</a>. They thought it an offence man could not commit against man; and have no word to express it in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. The unpolished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAPLAND\">Lapland</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a>, with these thoughts, is, as a human creature, much more respectable than the gay Briton, whose heart is tainted with vices, and estranged from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> affection; and he is happier. The perfect confidence mutually repaid between him and the honest partner of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, entails a satisfaction even in the lowest poverty. It gilds the humble hearth, and lights the cabin; their homely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a> is a sacrifice of thanks, and every breath of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> arises in incense. If <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> be laid upon hand, it is sure affection; and if some infant plays about their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a>, they look upon him and upon each other with a delight that greatness seldom knows, because it feels distrust.","sp":225,"ep":227},{"h":"CONTINENT","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a>, a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> not interrupted by seas, in contradistinction to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a>, &c.

He was one of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> children, all of whom are now dead except a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>, who married a fisherman of Redcar. He received the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of education from the schoolmistress of the village; and afterwards, on his father's removal to Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AYTON\">Ayton</a>, he was put to a day-school, at the expense of Mr Skottow, his father's employer, where he was instructed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> and in a few of the first rules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a>. Before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of thirteen he was bound apprentice to Mr W. Sanderon, a haberdasher or shopkeeper at Straiths, about ten miles from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITBY\">Whitby</a>; but some disagreement taking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> between him and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, he indulged his own inclination in binding himself apprentice to Messrs Walkers of Whitby, who had several vessels in the coal trade; and after serving a few years longer in the situation of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> sailor, he was at length raised to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATE\">mate</a> of one of Mr Walker's ships. During all this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> it is not recollected that he exhibited any thing peculiar either in his abilities or conduct.\n\nEarly in the year 1755, when hostilities broke out between France and England, Cook entered on board the Eagle of sixty guns, to which vessel Sir Hugh Palliser was soon after appointed, who soon distinguished him as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> and diligent seaman; and his promotion was forwarded by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> of recommendation which was written by Mr Olbaldeston, member for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCARBOROUGH\">Scarborough</a>, at the request of several neighbours, in Mr Cook's favour. On the 15th of May 1759, he was appointed master of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a>, which soon after sailed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, and joined the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> under Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Saunders at the memorable siege of Quebec. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRALTY\">admiralty</a> appears even then to have been very strong; for on Mr Olbaldeston's letter he was appointed master of the Grampus sloop; but the proper master having unexpectedly returned to her,\nher, the appointment did not take place. Four days after he was made master of the Garland; when upon inquiry it was found that he could not join her, as the vessel had already sailed; and the next day, May 15th 1759, he was made master of the Mercury. On this occasion he was recommended by Captain Palliser to a difficult and dangerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, viz. to take the foundations of the river St Lawrence, between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a> and the north shore, which he performed in the most complete manner; and soon afterwards he was employed to survey the most dangerous parts of the river below Quebec; these were his first efforts with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a>. After this expedition he was appointed, on the 22nd of September, master of the Northumberland, stationed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALIFAX\">Halifax</a>, where he first read Euclid, and applied to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a> and other branches of science. In the year 1762 he was with the Northumberland, assisting at the recapture of Newfoundland; and in the latter end of the same year he returned to England, and married, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARKING\">Barking</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSEX\">Essex</a>, Miss Elizabeth Batts. Early in 1763, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMIRAL\">Admiral</a> (then Captain) Greaves was appointed governor of Newfoundland, Mr Cook went out with him to survey the coasts of that island. At the end of the season he returned to England; but in the beginning of 1764, Sir Hugh Palliser being appointed governor of Newfoundland and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LABRADOR\">Labrador</a>, Mr Cook accompanied him in the same capacity of surveyor, and had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANVILLE\">Granville</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCHOONER\">schooner</a> to attend him on that business; in this situation he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till 1767.\n\nWhile Mr Cook remained on this station, he had an opportunity of exhibiting publicly a specimen of his progress in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of astronomy, in a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> printed in the 57th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Philosophical Transactions, entitled \"An observation of an eclipse of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> at the island of Newfoundland, August 5, 1766, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> of the place of observation deduced from it.\" Mr Cook's observation was made at one of the Burgeo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> Ray, in N.

Two voyages of this kind had been performed in the reign of George II., the one under Captain Middleton, the other by Captains Moore and Smyth, with a view to discover a northwest passage through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUDSON_S_BAY\">Hudson's <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">Bay</a> to the East Indies. Two others, under Captains Byron, Wallis, and Carteret, had been undertaken soon after the conclusion of the peace in 1763 by order of his present majesty; and before the return of these navigators, who were ordered to sail round the world, another voyage was resolved upon for astronomical purposes. It having been calculated that a transit of Venus over the sun's disk would happen in 1769, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> memorial to his majesty was presented by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>; in which they set forth the great importance of making proper observations on this phenomenon, the regard that had been paid to it by the different courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>; and intreating, among other things, that a vessel might be fitted out, at the expense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, for conveying proper persons to some of the Friendly islands, in order to make the necessary observations. This being complied with on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his majesty, Alexander Dalrymple, Esq., an eminent member of the Royal Society, was appointed to take the command of the bark appropriated for the purpose. In the execution of the project, however, an unexpected difficulty occurred. Mr Dalrymple, sensible of the impossibility of guiding a vessel through unknown and dangerous seas without any proper command over the crew, demanded a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREVET\">brevet</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> as captain of the vessel, in the same manner as had formerly been granted to Dr Halley in a voyage of discovery made by him. This commission Sir Edward Hawke absolutely refused to sign; declaring, when pressed upon the subject, that he would rather suffer his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> to be cut off than trust any of his majesty's ships to a person who had not been properly bred to the service; and in this proceeding he seemed to be justified by the mutinous behaviour of Dr Halley's crew; who, denying the legality of his authority over them, had involved him in a very disagreeable dispute, and which was attended with pernicious consequences. Mr Dalrymple, on the other hand, being equally determined in his refusal to proceed without the authority in question, there was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> for finding out some person of science who might also be free from the objection made by Sir Edward Hawke. Mr Cook therefore was proposed by Mr Stephens; and his recommendation being seconded by Sir Hugh Palliser, he was immediately appointed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the expedition; and on this occasion was promoted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> in his majesty's service.\n\nMr Cook's commission as lieutenant was dated May 25, 1768; a vessel of 370 tons, named the Endeavour, was provided for him; and while the necessary preparations were making for the voyage, Captain Wallis returned. It having been recommended to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> to fix upon a proper place for making the astronomical observations, he had accordingly chosen the island named by him George's Island, but since known by the name of Otaheite; judging also that Port Royal harbour in it would afford an eligible situation. This proposal being accepted, directions for the purpose were accordingly given to Mr Cook, with whom Mr Charles Green was joined in the astronomical part; the latter having been assistant to Dr Bradley in the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">observatory</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a>, and thus judged to be every way qualified for the office. The lieutenant was likewise accompanied by Mr Banks, now Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Banks, Dr Solander, &c. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of the voyage was, as has already been hinted, to make observations on the transit of Venus; but this being done, Mr Cook was directed to make further discoveries in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PACIFIC_OCEAN\">Pacific ocean</a>; and on the 29th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1768 he set sail on his expedition. An account of the voyage, and the discoveries made during the time of it, is given in the next article; here it is sufficient to observe, that throughout the whole Mr Cook approved himself an able seaman; and from his behaviour both to his own people and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> nations he occasionally met with, showed a most exact regard to the rules both of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>. On his first arrival at Otaheite, the following regulations were drawn up for his people, which he took care should be punctually obeyed:\n\n1. To\n1. To endeavour, by every fair means, to cultivate a friendly spirit with the natives, and to treat them with all imaginable humanity.\n\n2. A proper person or persons to be appointed to treat with the natives for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, &c., and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other person belonging to the ship to do so without leave.\n\n3. Every person on shore to attend punctually to his duty, and to pay proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to his tools or arms; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> lost through negligence, to have the full value <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> against his pay, with such farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> inflicted as occasion might require.\n\n4. The same penalty to be inflicted on every one who should embezzle, trade with, or offer to trade with, any part of the ship's stores; and,\n\n5. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> to be given in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> for anything but provisions. His rigid adherence to these rules was manifested in several instances, particularly by severely punishing the ship's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTCHER\">butcher</a>, who had threatened the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of a woman, wife to one of the chiefs of the island, for refusing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HATCHET\">hatchet</a> on the terms he proposed. On erecting their observatory, in order to go through the astronomical operations, an accident happened which had like to have disconcerted the whole scheme. This was the loss of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a>, which had been stolen by some of the natives; but, chiefly through the exertions of Mr Banks, it was recovered, and the observations made accordingly. Scarce was this accomplished, however, before another theft of the natives demanded the most serious consideration of the commander. Some of them taking advantage of the attention of the officers being otherwise engaged, took the opportunity of breaking into one of the store-rooms, and stealing from thence a bag of spike nails of no less than an hundred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>. This was a most important affair; for as those nails were of great estimation among the Indians, the possession of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> must undoubtedly have much lessened their value, and thus rendered provisions of every kind greatly dearer on the island than before. One of the thieves therefore being discovered, was punished with 200 lashes; notwithstanding which he obstinately refused to discover any of his accomplices. Repeated thefts committed afterwards required all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of Mr Cook to conduct himself in a proper manner. After due consideration, he judged it to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of importance to put an end to these practices at once, by doing something which might engage the natives themselves to prevent them for their common interest. This, however, he was not at present able to accomplish; nor indeed did it seem possible to prevent them without using firearms, which from motives of humanity he still determined to avoid. At last, after a stay of three months, when preparing to take his leave, the most disagreeable adventure took place that he had hitherto met with. This was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFECTION\">defection</a> of two of his people, who having married young women of the country, determined to take up their residence in it. Mr Cook was now obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> some of the chiefs, and to inform them that they could not obtain their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> unless the deserters were recovered. This at last produced the desired effect; the deserters were given up, and Mr Cook set sail, along with Tupia (who had formerly been the prime minister to Oberea, a prince of the island) and a boy of 13 years of age, both of whom were desirous of accompanying him to England.\n\nWhile Mr Cook proceeded to visit others of the South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> islands, Tupia occasionally served as an interpreter. On his arrival in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-NEW_ZEALAND\">New <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZEALAND\">Zealand</a>, Mr Cook found the people extremely hostile and insolent. At their very first meeting, one of the natives having threatened to dart his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANCE\">lance</a> into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>, was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> dead. Another, having carried off Mr Green's hanger was fired at with small shot; and upon his still refusing to restore it, was fired at with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> and killed. This, however, produced very little effect on the rest, who offered to make an attack upon them, till several muskets were fired with small shot, which wounded three or four more. Next day the commander, having determined to force some of the natives on board, in order to conciliate their affections by kind treatment, directed his men to follow two canoes whom he perceived under way before him. One made her escape, but the other, not observing the boats in pursuit, was overtaken; on which the savages plied their oars so briskly, that the ship's boats were not able to keep up with them. Tupia, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> the New Zealanders understood, called to them to return, with assurances that no hurt should be done them; but they continued their flight without minding him. A musket was then fired over their heads with a view to intimidate them, but upon this they prepared to fight; and on the coming up of the boats began the attack with so much vigour, that the lieutenant's people were obliged to fire upon them with ball, by which four out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> that were in the boat were killed, and the other three jumped into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and were taken on board.\n\nThis part of Mr Cook's conduct seems inconsistent with that humanity for which he was in general so eminently distinguished; he was aware of the censure, and makes the following apology. \"These people certainly did not deserve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> for not choosing to confide in my promises, or not consenting to come on board my boat, even if they had apprehended no danger; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of my service required me to obtain a knowledge of their country, which I could not otherwise obtain but by forcing into it in an hostile manner, or gaining admission through the confidence and good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> of the people. I had already tried the power of presents without effect; and I was now prompted by my desire to avoid farther hostilities, to attempt to get some of them on board; the only method we had left of convincing them that we intended them no harm, and had it in our power to contribute to their gratification and convenience. Thus far my intentions certainly were not criminal; and though in the contest, which I had not the least reason to expect, our victory might have been complete without so great an expense of life; yet in such situations, when the command to fire has once been given, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> can pretend to restrain its excess, or prescribe its effect.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the disaster <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned, to which the three New Zealanders, who were taken on board, had been witnesses, they were soon conciliated, and began to sing with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> that surprised the English gentlemen. They were boys, the oldest about 19 and the youngest about 11; but no kindness which\nwhich could be shown them was in any degree effectual to bring about a reconciliation with the rest. On the contrary, having perceived the ship in some distresses, they instantly showed a disposition to make an attack; and from this they were only prevented by the firing of a four-pounder charged with grape-shot.\n\nEven this did not produce any permanent effect; another attack was determined upon, and would undoubtedly have been made, had not Tupia informed them, that if they persisted in the attempt, the arms of their adversaries, like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>, would destroy every one of them. This was enforced by the fire of another four-pounder with grape-shot, which spreading wide in the water, terrified them to such a degree that they began to paddle away as fast as possible. Notwithstanding this, however, some intercourse began to take place; but in every instance the New Zealanders manifested their hostility and treachery in such a manner as showed that they were not to be gained by fair means. At last an attempt to carry off Tayeto, Tupia's boy, rendered it absolutely necessary to fire upon them in order to rescue him from certain destruction, some of the savages having got him into a canoe, where they held him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by violence. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this one of the savages was killed on the spot, and several more wounded, by the discharge of muskets from the boats; Tayeto recovered his liberty, jumped into the water, and swam to the ship. Some partial intercourse again took place; but still it appeared that the innate rancour of these savages was not to be subdued by any fair means; and it was only by the powerful arguments of cannon and musketry that they could be kept from attempting to do mischief.\n\nFrom the account of this voyage published by Dr Hawkeworth, indeed, it appears, that a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of savages perished in a manner similar to that above mentioned, and they seem to have manifested a more hostile behaviour than afterwards: on those melancholy occasions, however, it is observed to the honour of Mr Cook, that his humanity was eminently conspicuous beyond that of the common people, who all along showed as much inclination to destroy the Indians as a sportsman does to kill the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAME\">game</a> he pursues.\n\nWhile Mr Cook coasted the islands of New Zealand, he was sometimes in the most imminent danger of being shipwrecked. In the latitude of 35\u00b0 south, and in the midst of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, he met with such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALE\">gale</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> as he scarce ever experienced before; so that he was no less than three weeks in getting ten leagues to the westward, and two more before he could get 30 leagues farther. Fortunately, however, they were all this time a considerable way from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, otherwise it is probable that the storm must have proved fatal.\n\nMr Cook having spent six months in circumnavigating and fully exploring the islands of New Zealand, he sailed from thence on the 31st of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1770. It must be observed, however, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> hostility manifested by the inhabitants in that part of the island where he first arrived, was not universally diffused, but that a friendly intercourse was for a long time maintained with those about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUEEN_CHARLOTTE_S_SOUND\">Queen Charlotte's <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">Sound</a>. From New Zealand he proceeded to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-NEW_HOLLAND\">New <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, and on the 28th of April came in sight of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOTANY_BAY\"><a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">Botany</a> Bay. Here all their endeavours to induce the natives to have any intercourse with them proved ineffectual, though happily there was no blood spilt in any quarrel.\n\nDuring their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> round New Holland, the coasts of which are full of dangerous rocks and shoals, our navigators were brought into a more perilous situation than ever; and from which the escape was so extraordinary, that it deserves a particular relation. This happened on the 10th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1770, as they purposed their course from Trinity Bay, and nearly in the latitude assigned to the islands discovered by Quiros. At that time they had the advantage of a fine breeze and a clear moonlight; and in standing off from fix till near nine o'clock, the ship had deepened her water from 14 to 21 fathoms; but while the navigators were at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>, it suddenly shoaled to 12, 10, and 8 fathoms in the space of a few minutes. Every thing was then ready for putting the ship about, when they suddenly got into deep water again, and continued in 20 and 21 fathoms for some time, so that the gentlemen went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> in perfect security. A little before eleven, however, the water shoaled at once from 20 to 17 fathoms; and before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> could be heaved again, the ship struck, and remained immovable, excepting as far as she was heaved up and down, and dashed against the rocks by the surge. The alarm was now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>, and not indeed without the greatest reason. It appeared that the vessel had been lifted over the ledge of a rock, and lay in a hollow within it, where there were in some places from three to four fathoms water, and in others scarcely as many feet: the sheathing boards were disjoined, and floating round the ship in great numbers; and at last the false <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEEL\">keel</a> also was destroyed, while the rock kept grating her bottom with such force as to be heard in the fore store-room. It was now necessary to lighten the ship as much as possible: and this was done with all expedition to the amount of more than 50 tons. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of the 11th of June they discovered the land at about eight leagues distance, without any island between, on which, they could have been sent adrift in the event of the ship going to pieces, so that they might have been carried to the main land by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a>. To add to their distresses, the ship drew so much water, that it was with difficulty kept under with three pumps. Lastly, it appeared, that even the rising of the tide, on which they had ultimately depended for relief, was insufficient to answer the purpose as the day tide fell considerably short of that in the night-time. Having therefore lightened the ship till farther, by throwing out everything that could possibly be spared, they waited with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> for the next tide; when, after incredible exertion, the ship righted, and they got her over the ledge of the rock into deep water. By continual labour, however, the men were at last so much exhausted, that they could not stand to the pumps more than five or six minutes at a time; after which they threw themselves flat on the deck, though a stream of water between three and four inches deep ran over it; and in this situation, they lay till others, exhausted as well as themselves, took their places, on which they started up again, and renewed their exertions. In this dreadful extremity, Mr Monkhouse, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIDSHIPMAN\">midshipman</a>, proposed the expedient of stopping the ship, as it is called,\ncalled, by which means he said that he had seen a merchant ship brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a> to London after she had sprung a leak that admitted more than four feet water in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>. The expedient being approved of, it was put in execution in the following manner. He took a lower studding-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, and having mixed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> quantity of oakum and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> together, stitched them down by handfuls as lightly as possible; the whole being afterwards spread over with the dung of the sheep and other filth. The fall was then hauled under the ship's bottom by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a> which kept it extended. When it came under the leak, the wool and oakum, with part of the fall, were forced inwards by the pressure of the water, which thus prevented its own ingress in such an effectual manner, that one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>, instead of three, was now sufficient to keep it under. Thus they got the ship into a convenient port on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of New Holland, where they had an opportunity of repairing the injury. Here they discovered that their preservation had not been owing entirely to the expedient above mentioned; for one of the holes was in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> filled up by a piece of rock which had broken off and stuck in it; and this hole was so large, that had it not been filled up in the manner just mentioned, they must undoubtedly have perished notwithstanding all the assistance that could have been derived from the pumps.\n\nThe dangers they sustained in navigating this coast were innumerable, inasmuch that for very near three months they were obliged to have a man constantly in the chains heaving the lead. They were always entangled among rocks and shoals, which could not have failed to destroy a less experienced navigator; and even Mr Cook, with all his sagacity, could not sometimes have extricated himself, had it not been for the favourable interposition of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> events, which no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> penetration could foresee or have the least dependence upon. Of this we shall only give the following instance. Having at last, as they thought, got safely over the vast reefs of junk rocks with which the coast of New Holland is surrounded, they flattered themselves that all danger was past, and the vast swell of the water convinced them that they were now in the open ocean. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> of former dangers, however, induced them frequently to take the precaution of sounding; notwithstanding which, in the latitude of about $14^\\circ$ S. they found themselves one morning only about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> distant from the most hideous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAKERS\">breakers</a>, though the sea all around was unfathomable. Their situation was rendered the more dreadful by its being a dead calm, at the same time that they were carried towards the rock with such rapidity, that by the time they had got the ship's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> turned by means of the boats, she was scarcely 100 yards distant from it. Their only resource then was to tow the ship, if possible, by means of the boats and pinnace, out of a situation to very perilous; but all their efforts would have been unsuccessful, had not a breeze of wind sprung up, which, though too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> to have been noticed at any other time, was found to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> their efforts so effectually, that the ship began to move perceptibly from the reef in an oblique <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>: during the time that this breeze lasted, which was not more than ten minutes, they had made a considerable way. A dead calm succeeding, they began to lose ground, and in a little time were driven within 200 yards of the rocks: but fortunately the breeze returned, and lasted ten minutes more; during which time a small opening was perceived in the reef at the distance of about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of a mile. The mate being sent out to examine this opening, reported that it was not more than the length of the ship in breadth, but that there was smooth water within. On this it was determined to push into it by all means. The attempt failed of success; as, just when they had brought the ship with great labour to the mouth of the opening, they found a current setting out from it by reason of the tide now beginning to ebb. But though their hopes were disappointed in getting through the opening, they were, by the current setting out from it, driven in a very short time to the distance of a quarter of a mile from the rocks; and by dint of towing and other exertions, they were got by noon to the distance of two miles. This temporary deliverance, however, afforded but small prospect of being ultimately relieved. They had still no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> than of being forced back into their former situation by the return of the tide; but happily they now perceived another opening about a mile to the westward. Mr Hicks the lieutenant being sent to examine this opening, returned with an account of its being narrow and hazardous, but capable of being passed. To this place therefore the ship was directed by every possible means; and a light breeze happening to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> up, they fortunately reached it, and were instantly hurried through with great rapidity by the current of the returning tide; which, had it not been for this opening, would undoubtedly have dashed them to pieces against the rocks.\n\nFrom the time they quitted the coast of New Holland till their arrival at Batavia in the island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAVA\">Java</a>, our navigators met with no other danger but what is common in sea-voyages. They were obliged to stay for some time at this place to repair their damages; and on viewing the condition of the ship, found they had more reason than ever to admire the manner in which they had been preserved. Both the false-keel and main-keel were greatly injured; great part of the fleathing was torn off; several of the planks were much damaged, and among these there were two, and half of another, which for six feet in length were not above the eighth part of an inch in thickness, besides being penetrated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a> quite to the timbers. Here the crew were excessively annoyed by sickness, which obliged them to remain much longer than they would otherwise have done: and it is worthy of notice, that every one of the crew was ill excepting the sail-maker, an old man between 70 and 80 years of age, and who was drunk every night. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">Poor</a> Tupia, with his boy Tayeto, fell sacrifices to the unhealthiness of the climate, as well as the surgeon, three seamen, and Mr Green's servant. Nor did the evil stop here; for on their setting out from Batavia, the seeds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> which had been received there broke out in the most violent and fatal manner, inasmuch that in the course of about six weeks there died one of Mr Banks's assistants, by name Mr Sporing, Mr Parkinson his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> painter, Mr Green the astronomer, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOATSWAIN\">boatswain</a>, carpenter, and mate; Mr Monkhouse the midshipman, the corporal of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINES\">marines</a>, two of the\n\n4 H carpenter's\nCook's carpenter's crew, and nine seamen. Even the jolly old sail-maker could now hold out no longer; but whether his death might not in some measure be attributed to his being less plentifully supplied with liquors than formerly, might have deserved inquiry. These unfortunate events probably made a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on Mr Cook's mind; and perhaps induced him to direct his attention to those methods of preserving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> of seamen which he afterwards put in execution with so much success. After touching at St Helena, they continued their voyage for England, where they arrived on the 11th of June 1771; and on the 29th of August the same year, his majesty testified his approbation of Mr Cook's conduct by appointing him a captain in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>. On this occasion Mr Cook wished to have been advanced to the rank of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a>-captain, which, though not more profitable than the other, is more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a>; but this being inconsistent with the rules of preferment in the navy, the earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDWICH\">Sandwich</a>, at that time at the head of the admiralty, could not agree to it.\n\nCaptain Cook was not allowed to remain long inactive. The idea of a southern continent had long been entertained, and Mr Dalrymple had renewed the attention of the public towards the question, by his historical collection of voyages to the Pacific ocean, published in two quarto volumes, one in 1770, the other in 1771. To determine the matter finally, Captain Cook was again sent out; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of this voyage was not merely to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> the question just mentioned, but to extend the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a> of the globe to its utmost limits. That the undertaking might be carried on with the greater advantage, it was determined to employ two ships, on the choice and equipment of which the utmost attention was bestowed. The successful voyage which had already been made in the Endeavour, suggested the idea of that ship being a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> for the two which were to be sent out; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of Lord Sandwich concurring with the general idea, two vessels, constructed by the same person who had built the Endeavour, were purchased for the voyage. These were about 14 or 16 months old at the time they were purchased; and, in the opinion of Captain Cook, were as fit for the purpose as if they had been but newly built. The larger of the two, of 462 tons burden, was named the Resolution; the smaller, of 336 tons, had the name of the Adventure; the complement of men on board the former, of which Captain Cook was commander, being 112; on the latter, commanded by Mr Tobias Furneaux, 81. In their equipment, every article that could be supposed necessary, however much out of the common line, was procured, and every circumstance that could be supposed to contribute to the success of the voyage was attended to in the most scrupulous manner. Besides the usual stores and provisions, all of which were of the best kinds, the ships were furnished with malt, four-kraut, salted cabbage, portable soup, salop, mustard, marmalade of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARROTS\">carrots</a>, beer, and infusorial wort. Mr Hodges, an excellent landscape painter, was engaged to make drawings and paintings of such objects as required them. Mr John Reinhold Forster, with his son, were both engaged, in order to explore and collect the natural history of the countries through which they passed; and lastly, that nothing might be wanting to render the voyage as complete as possible, Mr William <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a> and Mr William Bayley were engaged by the board of longitude to make celestial observations. They were furnished with the best instruments of every kind, and among the rest with four time-pieces; three constructed by Mr Arnold, and one by Mr Kendall on Mr Harrison's principles.\n\nAt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLYMOUTH\">Plymouth</a> Captain Cook received his instructions; which were not only to sail round the globe, but to sail round it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> southern latitudes, and to make such traverses as might finally resolve the question concerning the southern continent. In pursuance of these instructions he set sail on the 13th of July 1772, and on the 29th of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> reached the Madeiras. As he proceeded afterwards in his voyage, he made three puncheons of beer from the infusorial wort carried out along with him, and found it excellently to answer the purpose, provided the material could have been kept without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a> in its infusorial state; but as this was found impossible, the expedient seems to have failed. In this voyage, however, the captain used with the greatest success such methods as appeared likely to contribute to the preservation of the health of his men. In rainy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, he took care that the ship should be aired and dried by means of fires made between the decks, the damp places were smoked, and the people were ordered to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> their bedding, and wash and dry their clothes, whenever an opportunity offered. Thus he reached the Cape of Good Hope without having a single man sick. Having left it and kept on his course to the southward, he soon began to meet with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and stormy weather, by which he lost almost the whole of his live stock of sheep, hogs, and geese. The bad effects of this stormy weather upon the men were guarded against by an addition to their clothing, and giving them a dram on particular occasions. On the fifth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>, being in the latitude of 50\u00b0 40', he fell in with islands of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>, and continued among them in various latitudes till the 17th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1773; when he set sail for New Zealand, which he reached on the 27th.\n\nThe reception of our navigator by the New Zealanders was now much more friendly than in the former voyage, so that there were no contests with the natives; nor did Captain Cook observe any one of those whom he had seen before, neither was there the smallest remembrance of former hostilities. Having stayed in this country till the 7th of June, our navigators set sail for Otaheite; but during the voyage the crews of both ships were attacked by the scurvy. Those of the Adventure were in a very sickly state; the cook was dead, and 28 of her best men incapable of duty. On board the Resolution matters were much better; and the only reason that could be conjectured for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> was, that the people of the Adventure had been in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of body more inclined to the scurvy than those of the Resolution, and had eaten fewer vegetables. Here it was observed, that the aversion of seamen to a change of diet is so great, that it can only be overcome by the steady and persevering example of a commander. While he remained at New Zealand, the captain had discovered a tree which greatly resembled the American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> spruce. Persuaded, therefore, that it would be attended with effects equally\nequally salutary on the health of the people, he employed them in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREWING\">brewing</a> beer from it. This was done while they continued at Dufky Bay, in order to supply the want of vegetables, which were not to be procured there; but on removing to Queen Charlotte's Sound, they were more fortunate. Captain Cook himself went to look out for antiscorbutic vegetables; and returned in a very short time with a boat-load of scurvy-grafts, celery, &c. These were boiled with the peas and wheat; and though some of the people disliked them at first, they soon became so sensible of their good effects, that they cheerfully followed the example of the rest: and the freedom of the crew from the scurvy and other distempers was by every one attributed to the New Zealand spruce beer and vegetables. From this time forward the captain had scarce occasion to give orders for gathering vegetables when they came to any land.\n\nDuring this voyage Captain Cook experienced another narrow escape from shipwreck. Being becalmed at the distance of half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> from a reef of rocks near Otago Harbour island, it was found necessary to order out the boats to tow off the ships; but this was found impossible. The calm continuing, and the situation of our navigators becoming every moment more dangerous, the captain attempted to get through an opening in the reef which he had judged practicable; but on approaching it, found that there was not sufficient depth of water; at the same time that the draught of the tide through it forced the ship thither in a manner scarce to be resisted. One of the warping <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a>, with about 400 fathoms of rope, was then ordered out, but did not produce any effect. They were within two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CABLES\">cables</a> length of the breakers, and no bottom could be found for casting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCHOR\">anchor</a>. Having no other resource, however, they did drop an anchor; but before it took hold, the Resolution was in less than three fathoms water, and struck at every fall of the sea, which broke violently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> under her stern, threatening destruction to every one on board. At last the tide ceasing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in the same direction, the boats were ordered to try to tow off the vessels; in which being assisted by the land-breeze, which fortunately sprung up at that instant, they with much labour succeeded.\n\nHaving spent a considerable time in the South Sea islands, Captain Cook returned to New Zealand, and from thence set sail for the southern part of the continent of America. Here he explored all the islands in the neighbourhood, and then returned to England, where he arrived in safety on the 30th of July 1774, having been absent three years and 18 days; and in all that time lost only one man, who died of consumption probably begun before he set out on the voyage.\n\nThe reception our navigator now met with was suited to his merit. He was immediately raised to the rank of post-captain, and soon after unanimously elected a member of the Royal Society; from whom he received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> medal for the best experimental paper that had appeared throughout the year. It was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of Sir John Pringle, at the delivery of this medal, annually to make an elaborate discourse, containing the history of that part of science for which the medal was given; and, as the subject of Captain Cook's paper (the means of preserving the health of seamen) was analogous to the profession of Sir John Pringle himself as a physician, he had the greater opportunity of displaying his eloquence on the occasion. The speech he made was in the highest degree honourable to Captain Cook. He remarked, that the society had never more meritoriously bestowed the medal than on the person who now received it. \"If (says he) Rome decreed the civic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> to him who saved the life of a single citizen, what wreaths are due to the man who, having himself saved many, perpetuates in your transactions the means by which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> may, on the most distant voyages, preserve numbers of her intrepid sons, her mariners; who braving every danger, have so liberally contributed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, to the opulence, and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> empire of the country?\" These honourable testimonies of the public regard, however, Captain Cook did not receive, being already embarked on another voyage, from which he never returned.\n\nThe third voyage of this celebrated navigator was not undertaken by any express command of his majesty. Captain Cook had already done so much, that it was thought but reasonable he should now spend the remainder of his life in quiet; and in order to enable him to do this in a more comfortable manner, besides his rank of post-captain in the navy, he was also made a captain in Greenwich. Still, however, there were some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> in the science of geography which had very much engaged the attention of the public, and were indeed of such importance as to become a national concern. These were to discover the connection between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> and America, and to determine whether there was not a possibility of shortening the passage to the East Indies by sailing round the northern parts of the continents of Europe and Asia. Many attempts, indeed, had already been made by various navigators of different nations; but all of them had failed, and, what was worse, had left the point still undetermined. An act of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> had been passed in 1745, by which a reward of 20,000l. was held out to the ships of any of his majesty's subjects for accomplishing this important voyage, but without mentioning anything of those belonging to his majesty; and this reward was further confined to the finding out of the north-west passage to the East Indies through Hudson's bay. In the year 1776, however, both the errors just mentioned were corrected. It was now enacted, \"That if any ship belonging to any of his majesty's subjects, or to his majesty, shall find out, and fail through, any passage by sea between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, in any direction or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> of the northern hemisphere, to the northward of the 52nd degree of northern latitude; the owners of such ships, if belonging to any of his majesty's subjects, or the commanders, officers, and seamen, of such ship belonging to his majesty, shall receive, as a reward for such discovery, the sum of 20,000l.\n\nIt was not, as has already been hinted, now deemed proper to solicit Captain Cook to undergo fresh dangers by undertaking a voyage of this kind; nevertheless, as he was universally looked upon to be the fittest person in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> for the purpose, the eyes of every one were tacitly fixed upon him: he was consulted on every thing relating to it, and solicited\ncited to name the person whom he judged most proper to conduct it. To determine this point, Captain Cook, Sir Hugh Palliser, and Mr. Stephens, were invited to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of Lord Sandwich to dinner; where, besides the consideration of the proper officer for conducting the expedition, many things were said concerning the nature of the design. They enlarged upon its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, its consequences to navigation and science, and the completeness it would give to the whole system of discoveries; until at last Captain Cook was so much inflamed by the representation of the importance of the voyage, that he started up, and declared that he would conduct it himself. This was what the parties present had desired, and probably expected; his offer was therefore instantly laid before the king, and Captain Cook appointed commander of the expedition by the 10th of February 1776. At the same time it was agreed, that on his return from the voyage, he should be restored to his place at Greenwich; and if no vacancy occurred during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, the officer who succeeded him was to reign in his favour. The instructions he now received were, that he should attempt the high latitudes between the continents of Asia and America, and if possible return to England along the northern coasts of Asia and Europe. This was most probably the result of the captain's own deliberations, and what had been suggested by him to Lord Sandwich and other people in power. He was particularly desired to sail first into the Pacific ocean through the chain of newly discovered islands which he had lately visited. After having crossed the equator, and passed into the northern parts of the ocean just mentioned, he was then to hold such a course as might tend to settle many interesting points of geography, and produce some intermediate discoveries, before he arrived at the main <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of operation. With regard to this principal object, he was ordered, immediately on his arrival on the coast of New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBION\">Albion</a>, to proceed northward as far as the latitude of 65 degrees, without losing any time in exploring creeks or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> previous to his arrival in that latitude; and for his further encouragement, the act of 1745, offering a premium for the discovery of the passage, was amended in the manner above mentioned. That nothing might be wanting which could promote the success of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> expedition, Lieutenant Pickering was sent out, in 1776, with directions to explore the coasts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAFFIN_S_BAY\">Baffin's bay</a>; and the next year Lieutenant Young was commissioned not only to examine the western parts of that bay, but to endeavour to find a passage on that side from the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean. Nothing, however, was performed by either of these gentlemen which in the least could promote Captain Cook's success. Two vessels were provided as in the former voyage, viz. the Resolution and the Discovery; the command of the former being given to Captain Cook, and of the latter to Captain Charles Clerke. The only thing in which the appointment of the Discovery differed from that of the Resolution was, that the former had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> officer on board. Every degree of attention was bestowed, as in the former voyage, upon the proper victualling and other necessaries for the two ships; and that the inhabitants of those countries which our navigator intended to visit might derive some permanent benefit from the intercourse they had with him, it was determined to send abroad a breed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> animals, and likewise a quantity of useful seeds, to be left in proper places. With this view, a bull, two cows with their calves, and several sheep, with hay and corn for their subsistence, were taken on board; and it was likewise proposed to take in others at the Cape of Good Hope. A large assortment of iron tools and trinkets was also sent out; and, in short, every thing that could be judged proper either to conciliate the good will of the natives or to prove serviceable to them, was provided for the voyage, as well as every convenience for the ship's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>. In the former voyage Captain Cook had brought along with him a native of one of the South Sea islands, named Omai, who resided in England during the interval between the second and third voyages, and was now happy at getting an opportunity of returning to his own country. Though he could by no means complain of the entertainment he had met with in England, the idea of returning home loaded with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a>, which might enable him to make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> among his countrymen, soon overcame all uneasy feelings which the leaving of his English friends might excite. His majesty had taken care to furnish him with everything that could possibly be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> when he came to his native country; and he had besides received several valuable presents from Lord Sandwich, Sir Joseph Banks, and several ladies and gentlemen of his acquaintance; so that nothing was omitted which could possibly be done to convey, by his means, to the inhabitants of the South Sea islands, an idea of the British power and greatness.\n\nEverything being prepared for the voyage, our navigator set sail from the Nore on the 25th of June 1776; but by reason of some delay in receiving his instructions, did not leave Plymouth till the 12th of July. He had not been long at sea before he began his operations for preserving the health of his people; which were found equally efficacious in this as in the former voyage. Finding his stock of provisions for the animals on board likely to run short, he touched at Tenerife, in order to procure a supply, having judged that to be a more proper place than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MADEIRA\">Madeira</a> for the purpose. On failing from thence he ran a great risk of running upon some sunk rocks on the island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONAVISTA\">Bonavista</a>; but in this, as well as on other occasions of danger, he behaved with the same judgment, coolness, and presence of mind, that distinguished him throughout the whole course of his life. On the 12th of August he arrived before Port Praya, in one of the Cape de Verd islands named St. Jago; but not finding it necessary to go in there, he continued his voyage to the southward. The weather now becoming gloomy, and rainy, required a continuance of the methods he had already practised for preserving the health of his people; and, as formerly, they were attended with the greatest success. In this voyage, the effect of these precautions was the more remarkable, as at this time the seams of the vessel were opened to such a degree as to admit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, so that scarcely any person on board could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> dry in his bed; and all the officers in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUN\">gun</a>-room were driven out of their cabins by the water which came through the sides. Such was the humanity of the commander, however, that while the ships continued at sea, he would not trust\ntrust the workmen over their sides to repair the defects, though caulkers were employed in the inside as soon as settled weather returned. On the 1st of September our navigators crossed the equator, and on the 18th of October anchored in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">Table</a> Bay at the Cape of Good Hope. Here they met with a violent tempest, the effects of which were felt both on sea and land. It lasted three days, and the Resolution was the only ship in the bay that rode out the storm without dragging her anchors. On shore the tents and observatory were destroyed, and the astronomical quadrant narrowly escaped irreparable damage. The Discovery, which had been some time later in failing from England, was driven off the coast, and did not arrive till the 12th of November.\n\nWhile they remained in this place, a disaster happened which threatened the loss of most of their live stock. The bulls and two cows had been put ashore to graze among other cattle; but Captain Cook had been advised to keep the sheep, 16 in number, near the tents, where they were penned in every night. Some dogs having got in among them in the night-time, killed four, and dispersed the rest. Six of them were recovered the next day, but the two rams and two of the finest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EWES\">ewes</a> in the flock were missing. The captain applied to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Plettenberg the governor; but all his endeavours were unsuccessful, until he employed some of the meanest and lowest of the people, fellows whose character was, that for a ducatoon they would cut their master's throat, burn the house over his head, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> him and his whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> in ashes. This is mentioned as an instance how far the boasted policy of the Dutch government at the Cape of Good Hope falls short of its alleged perfection. After all, two of the finest ewes in the flock were missing, and never could be recovered. The captain, therefore, to repair this loss, and to make an addition to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> stock, purchased two young bulls, two stone horses, two mares, two heifers, two rams, several ewes and goats, with some rabbits and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a>; when, having finished all his business, he set sail on the 30th of November, though it was not till the 3rd of December that he got clear of land. Soon after his putting to sea, he had the misfortune to lose several of the goats, especially the males, together with some sheep; and it was with the utmost difficulty that the rest of the cattle were preserved, by reason of the ship tossing and tumbling about in a very heavy sea. Having explored some desolate islands in the southern seas, Captain Cook set sail for New Zealand. During this part of the voyage, our navigators were involved in so thick a fog, that, according to the authors of Captain Cook's life, \"they sailed 300 leagues in the dark.\" The first land they afterwards reached was New Holland; where having remained till the 30th of January 1777, they set sail for New Zealand, and on the 12th of February they anchored in Queen Charlotte's Sound. Here the people were shy and timorous, on account of their having formerly destroyed 10 of Captain Furneaux's people, who had been sent ashore to gather vegetables. The cause of the quarrel could not be known, as none of the party were left alive to tell the news. Lieutenant Burney, who went ashore in quest of them, found only some fragments of their bodies; from which it appeared that they had been killed and eaten by the savages. It was not the intention of Captain Cook, at this distance of time, to resent the injury; he even refused to put to death a chief named Kaboora, who, as he was informed by the natives themselves, had killed Mr Rowe the commander of the party. He was, however, particularly careful that no opportunity should now be given the savages of committing such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> with impunity; and with this view a boat was never sent on shore without being well armed, and the men under the command of such officers as could be depended upon. The New Zealanders were no sooner assured of Captain Cook's pacific disposition, than they threw aside their fears and suspicions, and entered into a commercial intercourse with the people. It would have been the least excusable in Captain Cook to have revenged at this time the massacre of Mr Rowe's party, as he was assured that the quarrel originated from some petty thefts of the savages, which were too hastily resented on the part of the British; and had it not been for this, no mischief would have happened.\n\nOn the 25th of February our navigator left New Zealand, taking with him, at the request of Omai, two boys, the eldest about 18 and the youngest about 10. They were soon cured of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for travelling, being both violently sea-sick; but as it was then too late to repent, they expressed their grief in loud and almost continual lamentation; and this in a kind of song which seemed to consist of the praises of their native country, whence they were now to be separated for ever. By degrees, however, the sea-sickness abated, their lamentations became less frequent, and at last ceased entirely; their native country was forgotten, and they appeared to be as firmly attached to their new friends the English as if they had been born among them.\n\nSo much time was now spent in sailing up and down in the Pacific ocean, where several new islands were discovered, that Captain Cook judged it impossible to accomplish anything for this year in the high northern latitudes; for which reason he determined to bear away for the Friendly islands, in order to supply himself with those necessaries which he had found impossible to be got at any of the islands which he had just discovered. In his run thither several new islands were visited; and in prosecuting these discoveries our navigator once more narrowly escaped being shipwrecked. The danger at this time arose from a low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> island, which the Resolution was very near running upon. From this he was only saved by the circumstance of all the men having been accidentally called upon deck to put the vessel about, and most of them being at their stations when the danger was discovered. Soon after this both ships struck upon some sunk coral rocks, but happily were got off without damage.\n\nAfter a stay of between two and three months, Captain Cook took leave of the Friendly islands on the 13th of July 1777; and on the 12th of August reached Otaheite, where he introduced Omai to his country people, and whose reception by them is particularly related under the next article. Here the captain found the people of Otaheite ready to engage in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with those of Eimeo; but though strongly solicited by the former to assist them in an expedition against...\nagainst their enemies, he refused to take any concern in the affair, alleging, by way of excuse, that the people of Eimeo had never offended him. This seemed to satisfy most of the chiefs; but one, named Towuba, was so much displeased, that Captain Cook could never regain his favour. He even threatened, that as soon as the captain should be gone, he would make war upon Otoo, one of the princes of these islands whom he knew to be in strict friendship with him; but from this he was deterred by the captain's threatening to return and chastise him if he made any such attempt. As a mark of Otoo's friendship, he gave our navigator a canoe, which he desired him to carry to the king of Britain, having nothing else, as he said, worth his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCEPTANCE\">acceptance</a>.\n\nFrom Otaheite Captain Cook proceeded to Eimeo, where, on account of some thefts committed by the natives, he was obliged to commence hostilities, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> a number of their war canoes, and even some houses. These transactions gave him much concern; and the more that he had been so much solicited to make war on these people by his friends at Otaheite, to whose intreates he had refused to listen. From Eimeo he proceeded to Huahine, where he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> Omai finally settled, and left with him the two New Zealand youths already mentioned. The youngest of these was so much attached to the English, that it was necessary to carry him out of the ship and put him ashore by force. During his stay on this island, the captain was obliged to punish a thief with greater severity than he had ever done before, viz. by causing his head and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a> to be shaved, and his ears cut off. Some other disagreeable transactions took place, particularly the detention of two of his people, who were not recovered without the greatest difficulty. In the course of his exertions for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a>, he found it necessary to detain the son, daughter, and son-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, of the chief of an island named Oiaba. This had almost produced very serious consequences, the natives having formed a plot for carrying off Captain Cook himself, as well as Captain Clerke and Mr. Gore. With regard to the commander, they were disappointed by his own caution and vigilance; but Messrs. Clerke and Gore were in particular danger: and it was only owing to the circumstance of one of them having a pistol in his hand as they walked together on shore, that they were not seized.\n\nHaving left the Society islands, and discovered a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUP\">group</a>, which in honour of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> the earl of Sandwich, our commander named the Sandwich Isles, he let out on the 2d of January 1778 on his voyage northward. In this he was very successful, attaining the vicinity of the continents of Asia and America, which had never been done, or but very imperfectly, before. From these desolate regions he returned to the island of Onalashka; whence, having refitted and taken in provisions, he returned to the southward, and on the 26th of November reached the Sandwich islands, where he discovered a new one named Mowee, and on the 30th of the same month another of much larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, named O-wby-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEE\">bee</a>. Seven weeks were spent in exploring the coasts of this island; and during all this time he continued to have the most friendly intercourse with the people, who, however, appeared to be much more numerous and powerful than those of any island our navigators had yet touched at. Several of the chiefs and principal people had attached themselves greatly to the commander, and in general the people appeared to be much more honest in their dispositions than any whom he had ever visited. But by the time he had finished his circumnavigation of the island, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> anchor in a bay called Karakakooa, matters were greatly altered. An universal disposition to theft and plunder had now taken place; and in this it was evident that the common people were encouraged by their chiefs, who shared the booty with them. Still, however, no hostilities were commenced; the greatest honours were paid to the commander; and, on his going ashore, he was received with ceremonies little short of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a>. A vast quantity of hogs and other provisions were procured for the ships; and on the 4th of February 1779, they left the island, not without most magnificent presents from the chiefs, and such as they had never before received in any part of the world. Unluckily they met with a storm on the fifth and seventh of the same month; during which the Resolution sprung the head of her foremast in such a manner that they were obliged to return to Karakakooa bay to have it repaired. As they returned, Captain Cook had an opportunity of showing his humanity to the people, by the relief he afforded to some of their canoes which had suffered in the storm. The same friendly intercourse which had formerly been held with the natives now commenced, and Captain Cook was treated with the usual honours; but on the 13th of this month it was unhappily broken off on the following account. One of the natives being detected in stealing the tongs from the armourer's forge in the Discovery, was dismissed with a pretty severe flogging; but this example was so far from being attended with any good effect, that in the afternoon another, having snatched up the tongs and a chisel, jumped overboard with them and swam for the shore. The master and midshipman were instantly dispatched in pursuit of him; but he escaped on board a canoe, which paddled away so quickly that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTER\">cutter</a> could not come near it. A chief named Pareah, who was at this time on board the Resolution, understanding what had happened, promised to go ashore and get back the stolen goods; but before this could be done the thief had made his escape into the country. Captain Cook, who was at that time ashore, had endeavoured to intercept the canoe when it landed, but was led out of the way by some of the natives who pretended to be his guides. The tongs and chisel, however, were brought back to the master as he advanced to the landing place; but he being now joined by some of the rest of the people in the pursuance, could not be satisfied with the recovery of the stolen goods, but insisted upon having the thief or the canoe which carried him by way of reprisal. On his preparing to launch this last into the water, he was interrupted by Pareah, who insisted that it was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, and that he should not take it away. As the officer paid no regard to his remonstrances, Pareah, who seems to have been a very strong man, seized him, pinioned his arms behind, and held him fast by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> of the head. On this one of the sailors struck the chief with an oar; on which, quitting the officer, he instantly snatched the oar out of the man's hand,\nhand, and broke it in two across his knee. The Indians then attacked the sailors with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, and soon drove them to their boats, to which they were forced to swim, as they lay at some distance from the shore. The officers who could not swim retired to a small rock, where they were closely pursued by the Indians; and here the matter narrowly escaped with his life, till Pareah returned and obliged the Indians to give over their attacks. The gentlemen, sensible that Pareah's presence alone could protect them, entreated him to remain with them till they could be brought off in the boats. On his refusal, the master set out to the place where the observatories had been erected, for farther assistance; but Pareah, who met him, and suspected his errand, obliged him to return. In the meantime the multitude had begun to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> in pieces the pinnace, after having taken everything out of her that was loose: on the return of Pareah, however, they were again dispersed, and some of the oars restored, after which the gentlemen were glad to get off in safety. Before they reached the ship Pareah overtook them in a canoe, and delivered the midshipman's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a> which had been taken from him in the scuffle; he also joined noses with them in token of friendship, and desired to know whether Captain Cook would kill him on account of what had happened. They assured him that he would not, and made signs of reconciliation on their part. On this he left them and paddled over to the town of Kavaroah; and that was the last time that he was seen by the English. In the nighttime the sentinels were much alarmed by shrill and melancholy sounds from the adjacent villages, which they took to be the lamentations of the women. Next day it was found that the large cutter of the Discovery had been carried off in the night-time; on which Captain Cook ordered the launch and small cutter to go under the command of the second lieutenant, and to lie off the east point of the bay in order to intercept all the canoes that might attempt to get out, and if necessary to fire upon them. The third lieutenant of the Resolution was dispatched to the western part of the bay on the same service; while the master was sent in pursuit of a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> canoe already under sail, and making the best of her way out of the harbour. He soon came up with her, and by firing a few shots, obliged her to run on shore, and the Indians to leave her. This was the canoe belonging to a chief named Omea, whose person was reckoned equally sacred with that of the king; and to the neglect of securing him we may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> the succeeding disaster. Captain Cook now formed the resolution of going in person to seize the king himself in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of Kavaroah; and as there was reason to suppose that he had fled, it was his design to secure the large canoes, which on that account he caused to be hauled up on the beach. With this view he left the ship about seven o'clock in the morning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a> the 14th of February, being attended by the lieutenant of marines, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERGEANT\">sergeant</a>, corporal, and seven private men. The crew of the pinnace, under the command of Mr Roberts, were also armed; and as they rowed towards the shore, the captain ordered the launch to leave her station at the opposite point of the bay, in order to assist his own boat. Having landed with the marines at the upper end of the town, the Indians flocked round him, and prostrated themselves before him. No sign of hostility, nor even much alarm, appeared; the king's sons waited on the commander as soon as he sent for them, and by their means he was introduced to the king, who readily consented to go on board; but in a little time the Indians began to arm themselves with long spears, clubs, and daggers, and to put on thick mats which they use as defensive armour. This hostile appearance was greatly augmented by an unlucky piece of news which was just now brought by a canoe, viz. that one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> chiefs had been killed by the people in the Discovery's boats. On this the women, who had hitherto sat on the beach conversing familiarly, and taking their breakfasts, removed, and a confused murmur ran through the crowd. An old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> now appeared with a cocoa-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> in his hand, which he held out as a present to Captain Cook, flinging all the while, and making a most troublesome noise as if he meant to divert the attention of the captain and his people from observing the motions of the Indians, who were now everywhere putting on their armour. Captain Cook beginning to think his situation dangerous, ordered the lieutenant of the marines to march towards the shore, as he himself did, having all the while hold of the king's hand, who very readily accompanied him, attended by his wife, two sons, and several chiefs. The Indians made a lane for them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>; and as the distance they had to go was only about 50 or 60 yards, and the boats lay at no more than five or six yards distance from land, there was not the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of the catastrophe which ensued. The king's youngest son Keowa went on board the pinnace without the least hesitation, and the king was about to follow, when his wife threw her arms about his neck, and, with the affluence of two chiefs, forced him to fit down. The captain might now have safely got aboard, but did not immediately relinquish the design of taking the king along with him. Finding at last, however, that this could not be accomplished without a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of bloodshed, he was on the point of giving orders for the people to reembark, when one of the Indians threw a stone at him. This insult was returned by the captain, who had a double-barrelled piece, by a discharge of small shot from one of the barrels. This had little effect, as the man had a thick mat before him; and as he now brandished his spear, the captain knocked him down with his musket. The king's son, Keowa, still remaining in the pinnace, the detaining him would have been a great check upon the Indians; but unluckily Mr Roberts, who commanded the pinnace, set him ashore at his own request soon after the first fire. In the mean time another Indian was observed in the act of brandishing his spear at the commander; who thereupon was obliged to fire upon him in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>. Missing his aim, however, he killed one close by his side; upon which the sergeant observing that he had missed the man he aimed at, received orders to fire also, which he did, and killed him on the spot. This repelled the foremost of the Indians, and made them fall back in a body; but they were urged on again by those behind, and discharged a volley of stones among the marines, who immediately returned it by a general discharge of their muskets; and this was instantly followed...\ned by a fire from the boats, Captain Cook expressed his astonishment at their firing, waved his hand to them to cease, and called to the people in the boats to come nearer to receive the marines. This order was obeyed by Mr Roberts; but the lieutenant who commanded the launch, instead of coming nearer, put off to a greater distance; and by this preposterous conduct deprived the unfortunate commander of the only chance he had for his life: for now the Indians, exasperated by the fire of the marines, rushed in upon them and drove them into the water, leaving the captain alone upon the rock. A fire indeed was kept up by both boats; but the one was too far off, and the other crowded with the marines, so that they could not direct their fire with proper effect. Captain Cook was then observed making for the pinnace, carrying his musket under his arm, and holding his other hand on the back-part of his head to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> it from the stones. An Indian was seen following him, but with marks of fear, as he hopped once or twice seemingly undetermined to proceed. At last he struck the captain on the back of the head with a club, and then precipitately retreated. The latter staggered a few paces, and then fell on his hand and one knee, and dropped his musket. Before he could recover himself another Indian stabbed him with a dagger in the neck, though still without putting an end to his life. He then fell into a pool of water knee-deep, where others crowded upon him: but still he struggled violently with them, got up his head, and looked towards the pinnace as if soliciting assistance. The boat was now above five or six yards distance; but such was the confused and crowded state of the crew, that no assistance could be given him. The Indians then got him under again, but in deeper water, though he still continued to struggle, and once more got his head up; but being quite spent he turned towards the rock as if to support himself by it, when a savage struck him with a club, which probably put an end to his life, as he was never seen to struggle any more. The savages hauled his lifeless body upon the rocks, and used it in the most barbarous manner, snatching the daggers out of one another's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, in order to have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of mangling it. If anything could add to the misfortune of this celebrated navigator's death, it was, that even his mangled remains were not saved from the hands of the barbarians. The lieutenant already mentioned, who, by his removing to a distance when he ought to have come on shore, seemed to have been the occasion of his death, returned on board without making any attempt to recover his body; though it appeared from the testimonies of four or five midshipmen who arrived soon after at the fatal spot, that the beach was almost deserted by the Indians, they having at last yielded to the continual fire from the boats. The officer alleged in his own excuse for removing at first from the shore, that he mistook the signals; but be this as it will, the complaints against him were so many and so great, that Captain Clerke was obliged publicly to take notice of them, and to take the depositions of his accusers in writing.\u2014These papers, however, were not found, and it is supposed that the captain's bad state of health had induced him to destroy them. After all, we are informed that, in the opinion of Captain Philips who commanded the marines, it is very doubtful whether any effectual relief could have been given to the commander, even if no mistake had been committed on the part of the lieutenant. The author of all the mischief was Pareah, the chief already mentioned, who had employed people to steal the boat in the night-time. The king was entirely innocent both of the theft and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> of Captain Cook; but the latter was perpetrated by some chiefs who were his near relations. The chief who first struck him with a club was named Karimans raba, and he who stabbed him with the dagger was called Nooab. The latter, Mr Samwell, from whose narrative this account is taken, observes, was stout and tall, had a fierce look and demeanour, and united in his person the two properties of strength and agility more than he had ever observed in any other person.\u2014Both of them were held in great estimation by their countrymen on account of the hand they had in his death.\n\nBy reason of the barbarous disposition of the Indians, it was found impossible to recover Captain Cook's body after the first opportunity already mentioned was lost. By dint of threats and negotiations, however, some of the principal parts were procured with great difficulty; by which means the navigators were enabled to perform the last offices to their much respected commander. These being put into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COFFIN\">coffin</a>, and the service read over them, were committed to the deep with the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> honours on the 21st of February 1779. Soon after his death a letter was issued by M. de Sartine, secretary to the marine department of France, and sent to all the commanders of French ships, importing, that Captain Cook should be treated as the commander of a neutral and allied power; and that all captains of armed vessels who might meet with him, should make him acquainted with the king's orders, but at the same time let him know, that on his part he must refrain from hostilities. This humane and generous proceeding, with regard to France, originated from M. Turgot; but the thought seems first to have struck Dr Franklin. Thus much at least is certain, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a>, while <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> from the United <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a>, wrote a circular letter to the American naval commanders something to the purport of that already mentioned; but in this he was not supported by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGRESS\">Congress</a>; for an edict was instantly issued, that special care should be taken to seize Captain Cook if an opportunity of doing it occurred. The Spaniards proceeded in the same manner, and both acted on a principle equally mean and absurd, that the obtaining a knowledge of the western coast of America, or of a northern passage into the Pacific ocean, might be attended with some bad consequence to their respective states.\n\nCaptain Cook was a man of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> and appearance, but well looked, and upwards of six feet high. His head was small, and he wore his hair, which was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>, tied behind. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> was full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>; his nose exceedingly well shaped; his eyes, which were small and of a brown cast, were quick and piercing; his eyebrows prominent, which gave his countenance altogether an air of austerity. Notwithstanding this, it was impossible for any one to excel him in humanity, as is evident from the whole tenor of his behaviour both to his own people and the many\nmany savage nations with whom he had occasion to interfere. This amiable property discovered itself even in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> catastrophe of his life; his utmost care being directed to the preservation of his people, and the procuring them a safe retreat to their boats. And it cannot be enough lamented, that he who took so much care of others, should have perished in such a miserable manner for want of being properly supported by them. The perseverance with which he pursued every object which happened to be pointed out as his duty was unequalled. Nothing ever could divert him from what he had once undertaken; and he persevered in the midst of dangers and difficulties which would have disheartened persons of very considerable strength and firmness of mind. For this he was adapted by nature, having a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, inured to labour, and capable of undergoing the greatest hardships. His stomach bore without difficulty the coarsest and most ungrateful food; and he submitted to every kind of self-denial with the greatest indifference. To this strength of constitution he joined an invincible fortitude of mind, of which the circumnavigation of New Holland, and his voyage towards the South Pole, furnish innumerable instances. He was master of himself on every trying occasion; and the greater the emergency, the greater always appeared his calmness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a>: so that in the most dangerous situations, after giving proper directions to his people, he could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> soundly the hours that he had allotted to himself. That he possessed genius in an eminent degree cannot be questioned; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> was ready, and capable not only of suggesting the most noble objects of pursuit, but the most proper methods of attaining them. His knowledge of his own profession was unequalled; and to this he added a very considerable proficiency in other sciences. In astronomy, he became so eminent, that he was at length enabled to take the lead in making the astronomical observations during the course of his voyages. In general learning he likewise attained to such a proficiency as to be able to express himself with clearness and propriety; and thus became respectable as the narrator, as well as the performer, of great actions. He was an excellent husband and father, sincere and steady in his friendship, and possessed of a general sobriety and virtue of character. In conversation he was unaffected and unassuming; rather backward in pushing discourse, but obliging and communicative to those who wished for information: and he was distinguished by a simplicity of manners almost universally the attendant of truly great men. With all these amiable qualities, the captain was occasionally subject to a haughtiness of temper, which has been set forth in its utmost extent, if not exaggerated by some, though but few, who are not his friends: but even these, as well as others, when taking a general view of his character, are obliged to acknowledge that he was undoubtedly one of the greatest men of his age.\n\nCaptain Cook is distinguished as an author by an account of his second voyage written by himself. His first voyage, as well as that of several other navigators, had been recorded by Dr Hawkesworth; but on the present occasion it was not judged necessary to have recourse to any other than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> of the author himself; and his journal, with a few occasional alterations, and being divided into chapters, was sufficient for the purpose. The style is clear, natural, and manly; and it is not improbable, that even a pen of more studied elegance could not have made it appear to more advantage. When it appeared, which was not till some time after the author had left England, the book was recommended by the accuracy and excellency of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARTS\">charts</a>, and by a numerous collection of fine engravings done from the original drawings of Mr Hodges.\n\nWe cannot conclude this article without taking some notice of the honours paid to our celebrated navigator after his death, both by his own countrymen and those of other nations. Perhaps indeed it may be said with justice, that foreigners hold his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> in an estimation unequalled even in this country; a remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of which occurs in the eulogy upon him by Michael Angelo Gianetti, read in the Florentine academy on the 9th of June 1785, and published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a> the same year. It is said also, that one of the French literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">academies</a> proposed a prize for the best eulogium on Captain Cook; and many poetical testimonies of his merit appeared in our own language. The Royal Society of London resolved to testify their respect to him by a medal, for which purpose a voluntary subscription was opened. A gold medal was given to such of the fellows as subscribed 20 guineas, and a silver one to those who subscribed smaller sums; and each of the other members received one of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRONZE\">bronze</a>. Those who subscribed 20 guineas were, Sir Joseph Banks <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a>, the prince of Anspach, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Montague, Lord Mulgrave, and Messrs Cavenagh, Peachey, Perrin, Poli, and Shuttleworth. Many designs were proposed on the occasion; but the following was that which was actually struck. On one side was the head of Captain Cook in profile, with this inscription round it, JAC. COOK OCEANI INVESTIGATOR ACERRIMUS; and on the exergue, REG. SOC. LOND. SOCIO SUO. On the reverse is a representation of Britannia holding a globe, with this inscription round her, NIL INTENTATUM NOSTRI LIQUERE; and on the exergue, AUSPICIS GEORGI III. One of the gold medals struck on this occasion was presented to the king, another to the queen, and a third to the prince of Wales. Another was sent to the French king on account of the protection he had granted to the ships; and a second to the empress of Russia, in whose dominions they had been treated with every expression of friendship and kindness. Both these great personages condescended to accept of the present with marks of satisfaction. The French king wrote a handsome letter to the Society, signed by himself, and undersigned by the marquis de Vergennes; and the empress of Russia commissioned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Osterman to signify to Mr Fitzherbert the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> she had of the value of the present, and that she had caused it to be deposited in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">museum</a> of the Imperial Academy of Sciences. As a further testimony of the pleasure she derived from it, the empress presented to the Royal Society a large and beautiful gold medal, containing on one side the effigies of herself, and on the other a representation of the statue of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> the Great. After the general assignment of the medals, which took place in 1784, there being a surplus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> still remaining, it was resolved by the president and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, that an additional number of medals should be thrown off, to be dif-\nposed of in presents to Mrs Cook, the earl of Sandwich, Dr Benjamin Franklin, Dr Cook, provost of King's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> Cambridge, and Mr Planta. At the same time it was agreed that Mr Aubert should be allowed to have a gold medal of Captain Cook, on his paying for the gold, and the expense of striking it, in consideration of his intention to present it to the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a>.\n\nDuring the two visits of the ships at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KAMTSCHATKA\">Kamtschatka</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> Behm, the commandant of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>, had bestowed, in the most liberal manner, every kind of assistance which it was in his power to bestow; and such was the sense entertained by the lords of the admiralty of the kindness he had showed, that they determined to make him a present of a magnificent piece of plate, with an inscription expressive of his humane and generous conduct. The inscription was drawn up by Dr Cook, and afterwards submitted to the opinion and correction of some gentlemen of the first eminence in classical taste.\n\nSir Hugh Palliser, who had all along displayed an uncommon respect and kindness for Captain Cook, likewise displayed his regard for his memory in a most eminent manner. On his estate in Buckinghamshire he constructed a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> with a pillar containing the character of Captain Cook, which is given at the end of the introduction to the last voyage. This was drawn up by the honourable Admiral Forbes, admiral of the fleet, and general of the marines, to whom Captain Cook was known only by his merit and extraordinary actions.\n\nAmidst all these expressions of unavailing praise, it was not forgotten to show some essential service to the widow and family of our celebrated navigator. A memorial for a pension of \u00a3200 per annum was given in to the king from the commissioners of his admiralty, and signed by the earl of Sandwich, Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a>, the earl of Lisburne, Mr Penton, Lord Mulgrave, and Mr Mant. His majesty complied with the request of the memorial, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> was passed through the usual forms with all possible speed. By this \u00a3200 per annum were settled on the widow during life; and \u00a351 a-year on each of her three sons. After her death the \u00a3200 was to be divided between her children; a fourth was allotted to Captain King, and the remaining fourth to Mr Bligh and the representatives of Captain Clerke.\n\nThe last honour paid to the memory of Captain Cook was the granting a coat of arms to the family, which was done by patent on the 3d of September 1785; and of this we have the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. Azure, between the two polar stars: Or, a sphere on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> of the meridian, north pole elevated, circles of latitude for every ten degrees, and of longitude for every 15; flowing the Pacific ocean between 60\u00b0 and 240\u00b0 west, bounded on one side by America, and on the other by Asia and New Holland; in memory of the discoveries made by him in that ocean, so very far beyond all former navigators. His track thereon is marked with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>; and for crest, in a wreath of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> is an arm imbowed, vested in the uniform of a captain of the royal navy. In the hand is the union jack, on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a> proper. The arm is encircled by a wreath of palm and laurel.\n\nCook's Discoveries.\u2014The number of countries discovered by Captain Cook, and which had never before been visited by any European, is very considerable; but it was a remarkable property of our celebrated navigator, that, wherever he touched, everything relative to the place was determined with such accuracy and precision, that all former accounts seemed to go for nothing, and the discovery to belong entirely to Captain Cook. Thus it was not unusual with him to make discoveries in places already well known; and thus his voyages have conveyed a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> of knowledge perfectly original. Though the accounts of the different places, therefore, at which he touched, are particularly given under their names in the order of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a>, we shall in this article endeavour to join the whole together in such a manner as to give the reader some idea of the benefit which has accrued to science from voyages attended not only with much expense and labour, but even with the loss of the celebrated navigator's life.\n\nWhen he set out in the Endeavour in the year 1768, Madeira, the first place he touched at was Madeira. Here Mr Solander and Dr Solander, besides some additions to the island, science of botany, discovered undoubted marks of the island having a volcanic origin. On leaving this place, they found it necessary to touch at Rio de Janeiro for provisions, and, during the run thither, the commander had an opportunity of determining the cause of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> appearance of the sea. On the 29th of October they observed that the water frequently emitted appearance flashes like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>, though much smaller; but such was their frequency, that eight or ten of them were visible almost at the same moment. This appearance they found, both at this time and afterwards, to arise from a small kind of animal with which the water abounded. Whilst staying at Rio de Janeiro, a melancholy observation was made of the prodigious waste of human lives with which the working of the Portuguese gold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> was attended, no fewer than 40,000 Vaft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a> being annually imported for this purpose, none of whom, it seems, survive the labour of the year; and groans of our navigator was informed, that in 1766 this number of workmen was so far <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THORN\">thorn</a>, that they were obliged to draughting the gold 20,000 more from the town of Rio itself. Proceeding from thence to the southern coasts of America, he had an opportunity of determining a question of great importance to navigation, viz., whether, in sailing to the Pacific ocean, it is better to pass through the strait into the straits of Magellan, or to double Cape <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">Horn</a> and sail the Pacific ocean through those of Le Maire? From Captain Cook's through voyage it appears, contrary to the opinion of former straits navigators, that the latter is the preferable passage, Le Maire. Through this he was only 33 days in coming round the land of Terra del <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEGO\">Fuego</a> from the east entrance of the strait of Le Maire till he had advanced about 12 degrees to the westward, and three and a half to the northward of Magellan's straits. During all this time the ship scarcely received any damage, though if he had passed the other way he could not have accomplished his passage in less than three months, besides immense fatigue to his people and damage to the ship. In these stormy regions, however, he experienced the excessive cold and mutability of weather in these southern regions.\nCook's southern regions was experienced in such a manner as had nearly proved fatal to some of the gentlemen who failed along with him. Dr Solander, Mr Banks, Mr Monkhouse the surgeon, and Mr Green the astronomer, with their attendants and servants, set out on a botanical expedition while the ship lay at anchor in the bay of Good Success. It was then the middle of summer, and the morning on which they set out was as mild and warm as it usually is in the month of May in England; but having ascended a mountain for the purpose of botanizing, they were surprised by such storms of snow and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a> that they could not get back that night. Dr Solander, who warned them of their danger, that people when about to perish with cold were seized with a violent inclination to sleep, was the first who seemed likely to fall a victim to it; and it was not in the power of his companions to keep him from sitting down for that purpose. He was awakened in a few minutes; but during this short interval his feet had become so much diminished by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the vessels, that his shoes fell off from them when he was again made to rise. Even these dreary regions, however, are not without inhabitants, whom our voyagers justly concluded to be the lowest of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>. Indeed, considering the little convenience they have, it is wonderful how they can resist the severity of the climate, for they are almost without clothing; they dwell in miserable hovels, which admit both the wind and snow or rain; and they have not any utensil for dressing their food. Nevertheless, these miserable creatures, as they appeared to our navigators, seemed to have no wish to possess more than they enjoyed; and they were absolutely indifferent about every thing that was offered them, except large beads which they would take as ornaments. Hence Dr Hawkesworth, who wrote the account of the voyage, concludes, that these people may be on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with ourselves with respect to the real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> they enjoy.\n\nOn the 26th of January 1769 our navigators left Cape Horn; and from that time to the first of March, during which they run no less than 660 leagues, met with no current by which the ship was affected. Hence it is probable, that during all this time they had never been near any land, the currents of the ocean being usually met with in the neighbourhood of islands. Several islands, however, were discovered before they reached Otaheite, on which they bestowed the names of Lagoon Island, Thrumcap, Bow Island, the Groups, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">Bird</a> Island, and Chain Island. All these seemed to be inhabited, and were covered with a most delightful verdure; which appeared to the greater advantage, as our navigators had for a long time seen no land but the dreary hills and wastes of Terra del Fuego. Having arrived at Otaheite, they set about observing the transit of Venus over the sun, which indeed was the main purpose for which the voyage had been undertaken. The anxiety which they underwent when the time of the expected phenomenon approached may easily be imagined, as the whole depended on the circumstance of a clear sky, which though more readily to be expected in that climate than one more to the northward, was still a matter of uncertainty. In consequence of some hints which had been given by the earl of Morton, Captain Cook determined to send out two parties to different places to make the observations; by which means there would be a chance of success, even if those at Otaheite should fail. For this purpose he sent Mr Gore in the long boat to Eimeo, a neighbouring island, along with Mr Monkhouse, Mr Banks, and Mr Sporing, who were furnished with proper instruments by Mr Green the astronomer. Messrs Hicks, Clerke, Pickering, and Saunders, were sent in the pinnace to a convenient spot to the eastward of the main observatory, where they were likewise ordered to make observations with such instruments as they had. The day on which the transit happened was the 3rd of June 1769, when they had the satisfaction to see the sun rise without a cloud; and as the weather continued equally clear throughout the day, there was the best opportunity of making the observations in a proper manner. All of them saw an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> or dusky cloud round the planet, which disturbed their observation, and probably caused them to differ from each other more considerably than they would otherwise have done. According to Mr Green, the times of ingress and egress of the planet were as follow:\n\n**Morning**\n\n| Event                          | h. min. sec. |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|\n| First <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> contact        | 9 25 42      |\n| First internal contact, or total immersion | 9 44 4 |\n\n**Afternoon**\n\n| Event                          | h. min. sec. |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|\n| Second internal contact       | 3 14 8       |\n| Second external contact, or end of the transit | 3 32 10 |\n\nFrom these observations the latitude of the observatory was found to be 17\u00b0 29' 15\" S. and the longitude 149\u00b0 32' 30\" W. of Greenwich. Several curious remarks were made both on the country itself and on the inhabitants. Mr Banks, in an excursion up the Otaheite country, discovered many traces of volcanic fire; the volcanic stones, like those of Madeira, had evidently the appearance of being burnt, and the very clay on the hills had the same appearance. The natives, though addicted to thieving, appeared in general harmless and the natives friendly, and very ready to supply the ship with necessaries in exchange for such things as they wanted. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> on which they set the greatest value were hatchets, axes, large nails, spikes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a>-glasses, and beads. They were also fond of fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, whether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> or printed; but an axe of the value of half a crown would buy more provisions than a piece of cloth of the value of 20 shillings. They are very fickle and inattentive; so that it was not possible to engage them to pay any regard to the worship of the Deity which they saw performed before them; nor would they attend to any explanation of it that was given them. They are not, however, destitute of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of their own; and are particularly careful of the repositories of the dead, which they will not allow to be violated on any account. Of this Captain Cook had an instance, when some of his people offered to take down an inclosure of one of these repositories. They were violently opposed by the natives, who sent a messenger to acquaint them that they would never suffer any such thing; and the only insult that ever was offered to an Englishman by the people of this island was on a similar account. From Otaheite our navigators carried\nwith them Tupia, formerly high priest of the country, and prime minister to Queen Oberea. From his practice it appeared, that the priests of Otaheite, as well as elsewhere, take care to place themselves a step nearer the Deity than the common people, and to use the deceptions too frequently put in practice, by such mediators. While on board the Endeavour, he frequently prayed to his god Tane for a wind; and according to his own account never failed of success. This, however, he took care to ensure; for he never began his prayers till he perceived the breeze already on the water, and so near that it must reach the ship before they could well be ended. It was observed likewise of the people of Otaheite, that they had their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARDS\">bards</a> or minstrels, who went about the country with musical instruments. The band whom they saw at this time consisted of two players on flutes and three drummers; the latter accompanying the flutes with their voices. Their songs were made extempore, and the English themselves were generally the subject.\n\nFrom Otaheite our navigators sailed towards a neighbouring island named Teribora; but finding it small, low, and without any settled inhabitants, the captain chose rather to direct his course towards Huahine and Ulietea, which he was informed were well inhabited. These had never been visited by any European ship; but the inhabitants, though peaceable and friendly, were very slow and cautious in trading, so that the captain was obliged to bring out his hatchets to market; a commodity which he had hoped might have been concealed from those who had never seen an European ship before. On his arrival at Ulietea he found by the discourse of Tupia, that the inhabitants of a neighbouring island named Bolabola were of such a martial disposition as to be the terror of those of Huahine, Ulietea, and others, insomuch that he apprehended great danger to our navigators should they touch at an island which the Bolabola men had lately conquered. This, however, had so little effect upon Captain Cook, that he not only landed on the island already mentioned, but took possession, in his majesty's name, of Bolabola itself, together with Ulietea, Huahine, and another named Otaha, which were all visible at once. During their stay here they paid a visit to Opoony, the formidable monarch of Bolabola; whom, to their surprise, they found a feeble wretch, withered and decrepid, half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> with age, and so stupid that he seemed scarce to be possessed of a common degree of understanding. About these islands they spent six weeks, bestowing upon them the name of the Society Isles, on account of their being so near to each other. They are five in number, Ulietea, Huahine, Bolabola, Otaha, Tubai, and Mauna. The smaller ones in their neighbourhood are Tetuora, Eimeo, Tapo-manao, Oatara, Opururu, Tamou, Tohohatu, and Whenuaia.\n\nLeaving the Society Islands, which are situated between Lat. 16\u00b0 10' and 16\u00b0 55' S. and between 150\u00b0 57' and 152\u00b0 W. from the meridian of Greenwich, they fell in with the island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OHETEROA\">Oheteroa</a>, situated in S. Lat. 22\u00b0 27' and W. Long. 150\u00b0 47'; but this was found to be destitute of any harbour or safe anchorage, and the disposition of the inhabitants so hostile that they could not by any means be conciliated, so that no attempts were made to land. From Tupia Captain Cook learned that there were several islands in the neighbourhood, which our navigator conjectured to be Bofcawen and Keppel's islands, discovered by Captain Wallis; but without spending more time in exploring these, he set sail to the southward in search of a continent.\n\nOur voyagers left Oheteroa on the 15th of August Comet of 1769, and on the 30th had a view of the comet which appeared that year; its tail subtending on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of 42 degrees. This proved a new source of apprehension to Tupia, who instantly cried out, that as soon as it was seen at Bolabola, the people of that country would attack those of Ulietea, who would undoubtedly be obliged to fly with precipitation to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> their lives. On the 6th of October they discovered land, which from its size, and the enormous mountains observable on it, was supposed by the gentlemen on board to be part of Terra Australis incognita; but on farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> it was found to be part of New Zealand. Here the inhabitants were found to speak a dialect of the language of Otaheite, to that they could understand Tupia, and he them; yet so extremely hostile were their dispositions, that not the smallest intercourse could be held with them; nor could anything necessary for the ships be procured excepting wood: so that the name Captain Cook thought proper to bestow on this part of the country was Poverty Bay. By the natives it is called Tauneroa, and lies in S. Lat. 38\u00b0 42' and W. Long. 181\u00b0 36'. During the time of his stay in this part of the world the captain circumnavigated almost the whole country of New Zealand, which he found to consist of two islands separated from each other by a narrow strait, which, from its discovery, has obtained the name of Cook's Strait. In some places the disposition of the inhabitants was as favourable as could be wished; so that Dr Solander, Mr Banks, and other gentlemen, had an opportunity of exploring the country in some degree, with a view to discover its natural productions. In Rock of one of their excursions, as they passed through a valley, they were suddenly struck with the sight of a very extraordinary natural curiosity. It was a rock perforated through its whole substance, so as to form a rude but stupendous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> or cavern, opening directly to the sea. This aperture was 75 feet long, 27 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and 45 in height, commanding a view of the bay and the hills on the other side, which were seen through it; and opening at once on the view, produced an effect far superior to any of the contrivances of art. On that part of the coast, which, from having observed a transit of Mercury, they named Mercury Bay, oysters were found in such plenty, that they might have loaded not only their boats, but even their ship with them. They were about the same size with those met with in this country; and on account of their being found in such plenty, and likewise that the adjacent country abounds with conveniences, Captain Cook was at great pains to point out the situation of the place. By his observations, the latitude of Mercury Bay is 36\u00b0 48' 28\" S.\n\nLeaving this bay our commander proceeded to explore other parts of the country, which by their account seems to abound with rivers. Two large ones were met with in Mercury Bay; one of which, from the\nthe abundance of oysters found at its mouth, was called Oyster river; the other they named Mangrove river, from the number of mangrove trees growing there. A third, which they called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a>, was met with in that part called the Bay of Islands, up which they sailed 14 miles. Its banks were everywhere adorned with lofty trees, which they had likewise observed in other parts of the country. They were too heavy for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASTS\">masts</a>, but would make the finest planks imaginable; and as they resembled the pitch pine, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> of which is lightened by tapping, the carpenter was of opinion that they might thus be rendered more proper for masts than any European timber. One of these trees measured 19 feet 8 inches in circumference at the height of six feet from the ground, and was no less than 89, with very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAPER\">taper</a>, to the branches; so that the lieutenant supposed it must contain 356 feet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> timber. In Queen Charlotte's Sound the country was little other than one vast forest, with plenty of excellent water, and the coast abounding with fish. As the ship lay at the distance of only a quarter of a mile from the shore, they were agreeably entertained with the singing of an infinite number of small birds, which formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELODY\">melody</a> greatly superior to anything they had ever heard before. The music of these little choristers seemed to be like small bells, most exquisitely tuned, though probably the distance and intervention of the water had a considerable effect in heightening it. They began to sing about two in the morning, and continued their song till sunrise, after which they were silent all the day, resembling in this respect the nightingales of our own country.\n\nThe time which Captain Cook spent in exploring the coasts of New Zealand was not less than six months. By his researches it was shown to consist of two large islands, the most northerly of which is called Eabienomauwe, and the most southerly Tony or Tavai Poonamoo; though it is not certain whether the whole southern island or only a part of it is comprehended under this name. This island seems to be barren and mountainous, but Eabienomauwe has a much better appearance; and it was universally believed by the gentlemen on board, that all kinds of European grain, as well as garden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> and fruits, would flourish in the greatest abundance and perfection; and from the vegetables found here it was concluded that the winters are not more severe than those of England, and it was known by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, that the summer was not hotter, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> was more equal than in this country. Here are no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a> except dogs and rats; and the latter are so scarce, that they escaped the notice of many on board. The birds are not numerous, and the gannet is the only one of the European kind that was observed. The insects are equally scarce; but the sea makes abundant recompense for this scarcity of land animals; every creek swarms with fish, equally delicious with those in this country. The forests are of vast extent, and filled with excellent timber trees; the largest, straightest, and cleanest that Mr Cook had ever seen. There is here one plant which answers the purposes of both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>, and excels all others of the kind that have been met with in any other part of the world. If the settling of New Zealand therefore should ever be deemed an object worthy of the attention of Great Britain, Captain Cook was of opinion, that the best place for establishing a colony would be either on the banks of the Thames or in the bay of Islands; each of these places having the advantage of an excellent harbour. Settlements might be extended, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> made with the inland parts of the country by means of the river; and vessels easily constructed of the excellent timber with which the country everywhere abounds.\n\nThe inhabitants of New Zealand are in a very barbarous state, and have a degree of ferocity unknown to the inhabitants of the South sea islands, though they seem to have the same origin. During their residence there, our navigators had the most convincing evidences of their being cannibals, and accustomed to devour the bodies of their slain enemies. Notwithstanding these barbarous practices, however, they seemed to enjoy a state of uninterrupted health. In all the visits made to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, none was ever perceived who had the least bodily complaint, not even the slightest eruption on the skin. This extraordinary degree of health was likewise manifested by the ease with which their wounds were healed without the smallest application, as well as by the number of old men with which the island abounded. Many of these, by the loss of their hair and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, seemed to be extremely old, but none of them were decrepid; and though inferior in strength to the young men, they came not behind them in the least with regard to cheerfulness and vivacity. The universal and only drink of the New Zealanders is water.\n\nOur navigator had now explored three-fourths of that part of the globe where the southern continent was supposed to lie, without being able to find it; and his voyage had demonstrated, that the lands seen by former navigators could not have been parts of such a continent, though, as he had never proceeded farther to the southward than 40 degrees, the arguments for it were not as yet entirely overthrown. Mr Cook, however, did not at this time proceed farther in the search for such a continent, but sailed from New Zealand to New Holland, where he anchored in Botany Bay on the 20th of April. Here he found a few savage inhabitants more barbarous and degenerate than any that had yet been observed. Their language was harsh and dissonant, totally unintelligible even to Tupia; they appeared to have little curiosity, and set no value upon any present that could be made them. The most remarkable circumstance in this country seems to be its extreme scarcity of water; not a single stream of any consequence having ever been observed by any navigator. Some were of opinion indeed, that Moreton's bay, in S. Lat. 26\u00b0 59', and W. Long. 26\u00b0 28', opens into a river; though the only reason they had for this opinion was, that the sea looked paler in that part than usual, and the land at the bottom part of the bay could not be seen. At this time, however, the matter could not be determined by experiment, on account of the wind being contrary. The scarcity of water here is the more surprising, on account of the vast extent of the country, and likewise its having abundance of tolerably high hills. In this island there were found many curious plants and animals; and it was found, that in several places the magnetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a> was affected to such a degree, as to vary its position needle even to 30 degrees. At one time it varied no less prickingly than...\nthan two points on being removed to the distance of only 14 feet. Some of the loose stones being taken up and applied to the needle produced no effect; but Mr Cook was of opinion that the whole phenomenon was to be ascribed to iron ore in some of the mountains, and of which traces had been already met with. This irregularity continued in some degree even at sea; for when the ship was close under Cape Upstart, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of the needle in the evening of the 4th of June was 9\u00b0 east, and next morning only 5\u00b0 35\u2032; and this was in like manner accounted for from iron ore, or some magnetic matter below the surface of the ground. The great island has many other small ones round it, several of which were visited by our navigators. One of them, named Eagle Island, seemed to be inhabited by a monstrous kind of birds, the nest of one of which measured no less than 26 feet in circumference, and two feet eight inches in height; and in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. xx., there is an account of one of these nests still larger; but the bird to which it belonged was not seen. That which our navigators saw was built of sticks, and lay upon the ground.\n\nThe country which goes by the name of New Holland is by far the largest island in the world. Its eastern part, called New South Wales, now first explored by Captain Cook, extends upwards of 2000 miles in length, if the coast were reduced to a straight line. Though inhabited, as we have already said, by very barbarous savages, their number appears to bear no proportion to the extent of their territory. The intercourse they had with our navigators was so small, that they could pick up but a few words of their language. As a British settlement is now made in that country, there is no doubt that much more exact accounts will soon be obtained than even the diligence and attention of Captain Cook could collect on such a transient visit.\n\nIn this voyage our navigator, besides exploring the eastern part of the island, which had never been done before, discovered that it was separated from the island of New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUINEA\">Guinea</a>, to which it had formerly been thought to join. The two countries are separated by a strait to which the commander gave the name of Endeavour Strait. The north entrance of this lies in S. Lat. 10\u00b0 39\u2032, and W. Long. 218\u00b0 36\u2032; the passage is formed by the main land and a congeries of islands to the north, on which our navigator bestowed the name of Prince of Wales's Islands. These are very different both in height and extent; and the captain was of opinion, that several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> might be found out among them. On the coast of New Holland opposite to New Guinea are found cockles of an immense size; some of them being as much as two men could move, and containing 20 pounds of good meat. In these seas, as well as on the coasts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRAZIL\">Brazil</a>, our navigators found the surface of the water covered with a kind of foam called by the sailors sea-spawn. It was examined by Mr Banks and Dr Solander; but they could determine nothing farther than that it was of vegetable origin.\n\nThe natives of New Guinea were so hostile that no discoveries of any consequence could be made. They resembled the New Hollanders in stature, and having short cropped hair. Like them too they were absolutely naked, but somewhat less black and dirty. They had a surprising method of letting off a kind of fires, exactly resembling the flashes of firearms, but without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a>. It was not known in what manner this was done, as they were never near enough to make a particular observation. Those who discharged them had a short piece of stick which they swung side-wise from them, from which there issued the fire and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> just mentioned. This seems to have been intended as a defiance; for they had no effect as offensive weapons, and others were armed with bows and arrows. The country appeared extremely pleasant and fertile. The place at which they touched lies in S. Lat. 6\u00b0 15\u2032.\n\nAs the condition of the Endeavour was now very much shattered by having failed so long in these dangerous seas, the commander determined to make the best of his way for Batavia in order to refit. In this voyage he first passed two unknown islands without touching at either of them. They were supposed to belong to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA\">Aurora</a> islands; but if this be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the latter must be laid down at too great a distance from New Guinea. The Weasel Isles, laid down by former navigators at about 28 or 29 leagues from the coast of New Holland, were not seen; for which reason Mr Cook is of opinion that they are erroneously laid down.\n\nPassing by the islands of Timor, Timor-lavet, Rotta, and Seman, they next arrived at the island of Savu, where a settlement had lately been made by the Dutch. In this voyage they had the satisfaction of observing the aurora australis, which here seemed to australis differ in some respects from that in the northern hemisphere. It consisted of a dull reddish light extending about 20 degrees above the horizon; and though it varied sometimes in extent, it was never less than eight or ten degrees. From this general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of light there sometimes issued rays of a brighter colour, which vanished and were renewed like those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-AURORA_BOREALIS\">aurora borealis</a>, but without any of that tumultuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> observed in the aurora borealis. The body of the light bore S. S. E. from the ship, and continued without any diminution of its brightness from 10 to 12 at night.\n\nThe middle part of the island of Savu lies in 10\u00b0 35\u2032 south, and 237\u00b0 30\u2032 west longitude, and afforded a most charming prospect from the ship. The people are remarkable for the purity of their morals, which are said to be irreproachable, even on the principles of Christianity. Though no man is allowed to have more than one wife, instances of illicit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> between the sexes are scarcely known among them. Instances of theft are likewise very rare; and so far are they from revenging a supposed injury by murder, that when any differences arise among them, they are immediately and implicitly referred to the determination of the king. They will not even make it the subject of private debate, lest they should be provoked to resentment and ill-nature; and the delicacy and cleanliness of their persons are said to be proportionable to the purity of their morals.\n\nOn the arrival of the Endeavour at Batavia, our navigators had an opportunity of observing the effects of the electrical chains applied to ships in securing them from the effects of lightning. A dreadful storm from the thunder happened one evening, during which the sheets of mainmast lightning...\nCook's main-mast of one of the Dutch East Indiamen was split and carried away close by the deck, the main-top-mast, and top-gallant-mast being shivered to pieces. This ship lay so near the Endeavour, that the latter would probably have shared the same fate, had it not been for the conducting chain which fortunately was just put up. The explosion shook her like an earthquake, the chain at the same time appearing like a line of fire. The stroke seemed to have been directed to the Dutch vessel by an iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINDLE\">spindle</a> at the mast head; which practice our commander disapproves, but strongly inculcates the use of the electrical chain.\n\nOn their landing at Batavia, Tupia was confined by sickness, so that he appeared quite lifeless and dejected when put into the boat; but on his arrival at land recovered his spirits surprisingly. The scene, to him new and extraordinary, seemed to produce an effect similar to what is produced by enchantment. His attention was particularly engaged by the various dresses of the people; and being informed that at Batavia every one appeared in the dress of his own country, he expressed a desire of likewise appearing in the garb of Otaheite. Having therefore been furnished with South sea cloth from the ship, he equipped himself with great quickness and dexterity. After the first flow of spirits had subsided, however, he soon began to feel the fatal effects of the climate; and his boy Tayeto, whose spirits had been still more elevated on his arrival, was attacked with an inflammation of the lungs, and in a little time fell a victim to the disease. Tupia himself did not long survive him, and his death was not attributed solely to the unwholesomeness of the climate. Having been accustomed from his infancy to subsist chiefly upon vegetable food, and particularly on ripe fruit, he had soon contracted the disorders incident to a sea life, and could scarce have been expected to reach England, even if the unwholesome climate of Batavia had been out of the question.\n\nThe Endeavour left Batavia on the 27th of December 1770, and on the 5th of January 1781 reached Prince's island. This place had been formerly much frequented by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> ships, but of late entirely deserted on account of the supposed bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the water; but this our navigator has discovered to be a mistake; and that, though the water near the sea is brackish, it may be had of excellent quality by going a little way up the country. He is of opinion, that this island is a more proper place for ships to touch at than either North Island or New Bay, because neither of these can afford other refreshments which may be had at Prince's island.\n\nThe rest of the voyage affords but little interesting matter. The Cape of Good Hope, which was their next stage, has been so fully described by former navigators that there was little room for addition. At St Helena the commander made some remarks on the rigorous treatment of the slaves, which was represented as worse than that of the Dutch either at Batavia or the Cape of Good Hope. In the account of his second voyage, however, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a> was retracted.\n\nCaptain Cook's second voyage was undertaken in an especial manner to determine finally the question concerning the existence of a southern continent. It commenced in the year 1772; and, as in the former, he proceeded first to Madeira. From thence he proceeded to St Jago, one of the Cape de Verde islands; where an opportunity was taken of delineating and giving such a description of Port Praya, and the supplies to be there obtained, as might be of use to future navigators. On the 8th of September he crossed the line in 8\u00b0 west longitude, and had the satisfaction to meet with good weather, though he had been informed that he had failed at an improper time of the year, in consequence of which he would probably be becalmed. From his account, however, it appears, that though in some years such weather may be expected, it is by no means universally the case. In this part of the ocean calm storms had also an opportunity of observing the cause always of the luminous property of sea-water, which in his feared former voyage had been attributed to insects. Mr Forster, near the equinoctial, after being of a different opinion, the matter was again particularly inquired into, but the result was entirely conformable to the former determination. Some buckets of water being drawn up from alongside the ship, quality of sea water were found to be filled with those insects of a globular form, and about the size of a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a>'s head. No further determined life indeed could be perceived in them; but Mr Forster was thoroughly convinced of their being living animals when in their proper element.\n\nProceeding southward in quest of a continent, they fell in with ice islands in S. Lat. 50\u00b0 40' and two degrees of longitude east from the Cape of Good Hope. One of these was so much concealed by the haziness of the weather, that it could not be seen at the distance of more than a mile. Captain Cook judged it to be about 50 feet in height and half a mile in circumference; its sides rising in a perpendicular direction, and the sea breaking against them with great violence. Two days after, they passed six others, some of which were two miles in circumference and 60 feet in height; yet such was the strength and violence of the waves that the sea broke quite over them. On the 14th they were stopped by a vast field of low ice, of which they could perceive no end. In different parts of this field there were seen islands, or hills of ice like those already described, and some of the people imagined that they saw land over them; but upon a narrow examination this was found to be a mistake. On getting clear of the field of ice they again fell in with loose islands; and as it was a general opinion that these are only formed in bays and rivers, our navigators concluded that they could not be at a great distance from land. They were now in the latitude of 55\u00b0 40' south; and as they had failed for more than 30 leagues along the edge of the ice without finding any opening, the captain determined to run 30 or 40 leagues farther to the eastward, in hopes of then getting to the southward. If in this attempt he met with no land or other impediment, his design was to stretch behind the ice altogether, and thus determine the matter at once. In a short time, however, it became evident that the field of ice along which they had sailed so long, did not join with any land; and the captain now came to a resolution of running as far to the west as the meridian of Cape Circumcision. In the prosecution of this design he met with a very severe storm, which was rendered the more dangerous by the pieces of loose ice among\namong which they were still entangled, and a vast field of which they could not perceive the boundaries about three miles to the northward. Of this they could not get clear without receiving some severe strokes; and after all, when they arrived at the place where they ought to have found Cape Circumcision, it could not be discovered; so that the captain concluded that what Bouvet took for land could have been nothing but ice.\n\nDuring this run the fallacy of the general opinion had been discovered, that the ice with which the polar regions abound has been formed in the vicinity of land. It was found likewise, that the water produced from the melting of ice, even though formed in the ocean, was perfectly sweet and well tasted. Of this circumstance the captain took advantage to supply himself with water; and gave it as his opinion that it was the most expeditious method of watering he had ever known. He had likewise an opportunity of detecting another popular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, viz., that penguins, albatrosses, and other birds of that kind, never go far from land. This indeed may be the case in open seas, but in such as are covered with ice it is very different; for they then inhabit the ice islands, and float out with them to sea at a great distance.\n\nWhen in the latitude of 49\u00b0 13' S. some signs of land were perceived; but as the wind did not admit of any search being made in the direction where it was supposed to lie, the captain proceeded in his voyage to the eastward. A very remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in the direction of the needle was now perceived, and which could not be supposed owing to the vicinity of any magnetic matter, as it happened while the ships were far out at sea. The circumstance was, that when the sun was on the starboard side of the ship the variation was least, but greatest when on the opposite side. An aurora australis was again observed, which broke out in spiral or circular rays, and had a beautiful appearance; but did not seem to have any particular direction, being conspicuous at various times in different parts of the heavens, and diffusing its light over the whole atmosphere.\n\nThe extreme cold and stormy weather which now began to take place, determined Captain Cook not to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANTARCTIC\">antarctic</a> circle a second time as he had once designed. His observations confirmed the accounts of former navigators, that the cold of the southern seas is much more intense than in equal latitudes in the northern hemisphere; but at the same time it showed that this cold cannot be owing to the vicinity of a continent, as had been formerly imagined. On the contrary, it was now determined beyond dispute, that if any such continent existed in the eastern part of the southern ocean, it must be confined within the latitude of 60 degrees. No farther discoveries therefore being practicable in higher latitudes, as the winter season was approaching, the commander steered for New Zealand, where he anchored in Dusky Bay on the 25th of March, having been at sea 117 days without once coming in sight of land. Here the time was spent in procuring proper refreshments for the people, and exploring the sea-coast and country for the benefit of future navigators. Nor was our commander unmindful of the inhabitants. Here he left the five geese which yet remained, choosing for them a place where there were no people at the time to disturb them; and as they had there great plenty of food, he had no doubt of their breeding, and in a short time spreading over the country. Some days after a piece of ground was cleared by setting fire to the topwood, after which it was dug up and sowed with garden seeds. Dusky Bay is situated in the western island of New Zealand, called Tavai Poenamoo, which, as has already been said, is less fertile than the other. The inland part is full of rugged mountains of a vast height; but the sea-coast is covered with trees, among which is the true spruce, which was found to be of great use. It was remarked, that though a vast quantity of rain fell during the time of residence here, it was not attended with any bad effects on the health of the people; which furnishes an additional argument for the healthiness of the place. Dusky Bay is reckoned by Captain Cook to be the most proper place in New Zealand for the procuring of refreshments, though it is attended with some disagreeable circumstances, particularly being infested with great numbers of black land-flies, which were troublesome to an extreme degree. The natives seen at Dusky Bay were apparently of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> with those seen in other parts of the country, and led a wandering life, without any appearance of being united in the bonds of society or friendship.\n\nFrom Dusky Bay the captain proceeded to Queen Charlotte's Sound, where he met with the Adventure, which had been separated from the Resolution for above 14 weeks. In his passage thither he had an opportunity of observing six water spouts, one of which passed within 50 yards of the Resolution. It has been a common opinion, that these meteors are dissipated by the firing of a gun, and the captain was sorry he had not made the experiment; but he acknowledges, that though he had a gun ready for the purpose, and was near enough, his attention was so much engaged in viewing them, that he forgot to give the necessary orders.\n\nHaving planted another garden in this part of the country, and left two goats, two breeding fows and a boar, in as private a situation as possible, that they might be for some time out of the reach of the natives, the captain set sail for Otaheite. During the long absence of the Adventure, Captain Furneaux had visited the coast of New Holland, and discovered that there was no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VAN_DIEMEN_S_LAND\">Van Diemen's land</a> being separated from it by straits; he had likewise found additional proofs that the natives of New Zealand were accustomed to eat human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>. Captain Cook also remarked with concern, that the morals of the New Zealanders were by no means improved by the visit he had formerly paid them. At that time he looked upon the women to be more chaste than those of most of the nations he had visited; but now they were ready to prostitute themselves for a spikenail, and the men to force them to such an infamous traffic, whether agreeable to the inclinations of the females or not.\n\nIn the run from New Zealand to Otaheite, our commander passed very near the situation assigned by Captain Carteret to Pitcairn's island, discovered by him in 1767, but without being able to find it, though a sight of it would have been useful for correcting its longitude as well as that of others in the neighbourhood;\nCook's hood; but there was not at present any time to spend in searching for it. Proceeding farther on in his voyage, however, he fell in with a cluster of islands supposed to be the same discovered by M. Bougainville; New islands and named by him the Dangerous Archipelago. To discovered four of these Captain Cook gave the names of Resolution, Doubtful, Furneaux, and Adventure Islands. Resolution Island is situated in S. Lat. 17\u00b0 24', W. Long. 141\u00b0 39'. Doubtful Island in S. Lat. 17\u00b0 20', W. Long. 141\u00b0 38'. Furneaux Island in S. Lat. 17\u00b0 5', W. Long. 143\u00b0 16', and Adventure Island in S. Lat. 17\u00b0 14' and W. Long. 144\u00b0 30'.\n\nNo discovery of any great consequence was made at concerning the island of Otaheite or those in its neighbourhood, excepting that the captain had an opportunity of correcting the opinion, which till now had prevailed, of the excessive dissoluteness and immodesty of the women of Otaheite; and which had been enlarged upon by Dr. Hawkesworth more than seemed to be consistent with decency. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>, however, according to the accounts of this second voyage, is far from being indiscriminately true, even of the unmarried females of the lower class. Some additions were made to the knowledge of the geography of those islands; and from Huahine Captain Furneaux took on board of his ship one of the natives of Ulietea named Onai, afterwards so much spoken of in England. Captain Cook at first appeared dissatisfied with his choice of this youth, as being inferior in rank to many others, and having no particular advantage in shape, figure, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>; however, he had afterwards reason to be better pleased. During the captain's residence at Otaheite, he used his utmost endeavours to discover whether the venereal disease was endemic among them, or whether it had been imported by Europeans; but in this he could not meet with any perfectly satisfactory account, though it was universally agreed, that if it had been introduced by Europeans, it must have been by the French under M. Bougainville.\n\nCaptain Cook having left Ulietea on the 17th of September 1773, directed his course westward, with an inclination to the south. In this course he discovered land in S. Lat. 19\u00b0 8' and W. Long. 148\u00b0 54', to which he gave the name of Harvey's Island. From thence he proceeded to the island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIDDLEBURG\">Middleburg</a>, where he was treated in the most hospitable manner possible. To such an extent did the people carry their generosity, that they seemed to be more fond of giving away their goods than in receiving anything for them; inasmuch that many, who had not an opportunity of coming near the boats, threw over the heads of others whole bales of cloth, and then retired, without either waiting or asking for anything in return. From Middleburg he proceeded to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a> island, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and cultivation of the island afforded the most enchanting prospect. There was not an inch of waste ground; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> were no wider than what was absolutely necessary, and the fences not above four inches thick. Even this was not absolutely lost; for many of these contained useful trees or plants.\n\nIt is observable of the isles of Middleburg and Amsterdam, as well as of most others in the South Sea, that they are guarded from the waves by a reef of coral rocks, which extend about one hundred fathoms from the shore. Thus they are effectually secured from the encroachments of the ocean; by which they would probably soon be swallowed up, as most of them are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> points in comparison of the vast quantity of water which surrounds them. Here he left a quantity of garden vegetable seeds and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a>, which it was not doubted would be taken care of by the industrious inhabitants. In the last mentioned islands our navigators found no animals but hogs and fowls; the former being of the same kind with those usually seen in the other islands of the South Sea; but the latter greatly preferable, equalling those of Europe in their size, and even preferable in respect of the goodness of their flesh.\n\nOn the 7th of October, Captain Cook left the island of Amsterdam, with a design to pay another visit to New Zealand, in order to take in wood and water for his voyage in quest of a southern continent. The day after he left Amsterdam he fell in with the island of Pillart, formerly discovered by Tasman, and situated in S. Lat. 26\u00b0 W. Long. 175\u00b0 59', thirty-two leagues distant from the east end of Middleburg. On his arrival at New Zealand, he exerted himself as much as possible to leave a proper assortment of vegetables and animals for the benefit of the inhabitants. One of the first things he did, therefore, was to make a present to a chief, who had come off in a canoe, of a quantity of the most useful garden seeds, such as cabbage, turnips, onions, carrots, parsnips, and yams; together with some wheat, French and kidney beans and peas. With the same person also be left two boars, two fows, four hens, and two cocks. This present, however valuable in itself, seems to have been but indifferently received; for the chief was much better satisfied with a spikenail half the length of his arm than with all the rest; notwithstanding which, he promised to take care of the seeds, and not to kill any of the animals. On inquiring about those animals left in the country in the former part of his voyage, the captain was informed, that the boar and one of the fows had been separated, but not killed. The other he saw in good condition, and very tame. The two goats, he was informed, had been killed by a native of the name of Gaubiah. The gardens had met with a better fate; all the articles being in a very flourishing condition, though left entirely to nature, excepting the potatoes. Captain Cook, however, still determined to supply these islanders with useful animals, put on shore a boar, a young fow, two cocks, and two hens, which he made a present of to the adjacent inhabitants. Three other fows and a boar, with two cocks and hens, he ordered to be left in the country without the knowledge of the Indians. They were carried a little way into the woods, and there left with as much food as would serve them for 10 or 12 days, in order to prevent them from coming down to the coast in quest of it, and thus being discovered.\n\nA second separation from the Adventure had now taken place; notwithstanding which, Captain Cook set out alone with his vessel in quest of a southern continent; and such was the confidence put in him by the sailors, that all of them expressed as much satisfaction and alacrity as if not only the Adventure, but even so many ships had been in company.\n\nOn the 26th of November the captain set sail from New Zealand; and on the 12th of December began to fall\nCook's fall in with the ice, but considerably farther to the southward than they had met with it in the former part of his voyage; being now in the Lat. of 62\u00b0 10' S. and 72\u00b0 W. Long. As they proceeded southward, the number of ice islands increased prodigiously, and in Lat. 67\u00b0 31' and W. Long. 142\u00b0 54', they all at once got into among such a cluster of these islands, that it became a matter of the utmost difficulty and danger to keep clear of them. Finding it impossible, therefore, to get any farther to the southward at present, the captain determined to explore a considerable tract of sea to the north of his present situation, and then again to stand to the south. But in this he was still unsuccessful; no land being discovered either in sailing northward, eastward, westward, or southward; though he proceeded as far in the last direction as 71\u00b0 10' S. Lat. and 106\u00b0 54' W. It was now impossible to proceed; and the opinion of the captain himself, as well as of most of the gentlemen on board, was that the ice by which they were now stopped extended as far as the pole. As there was still room, however, in parts of the ocean entirely unexplored, for very large islands, our commander determined not to abandon the pursuit in which he was engaged until there should not be any possibility of doing more; and besides the possibility of making new discoveries, he was convinced that many of the islands already discovered were so obscurely known, that it was of consequence to pay them a second visit. With this view he proposed to go in quest of Easter or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAVIS_S_ISLAND\">Davis's island</a>; the situation of which was known with so little certainty, that none of the attempts lately made to discover it had been successful. He next intended to get within the tropic, and then to proceed to the west, touching at any islands he might meet with, and settling their situations, until he should arrive at Otaheite, where it was necessary for him to make some stay in order to look for the Adventure. It was part of his design also to run to the westward as far as Terra Austral del Espiritu Santo, discovered by Quiros, and which M. Bougainville had named The Great Cyclades. From this land he proposed to sail to the southward, and from thence to the east between the latitude of 50\u00b0 and 60\u00b0. In the execution of this design, he determined if possible to reach Cape Horn, during the ensuing November, when he would have the best part of the summer before him to explore the southern part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATLANTIC_OCEAN\">Atlantic ocean</a>.\n\nIn pursuing his course to the northward, it had been part of his design to find out the land said to have been discovered by Juan Fernandez in about the latitude of 38\u00b0; but he was soon convinced, that if any such land existed, it could only be a very small island; but the prosecution of the design was for some little time interrupted by a violent bilious disorder by which the captain was attacked. In this, when he began to recover, as there was no fresh meat on board, he was obliged to have recourse to dog's flesh; and a favourite animal belonging to Mr Forster was sacrificed on the occasion. The captain was able to eat not only of the broth made of this, but likewise of the flesh, when his stomach could bear nothing else. On the 11th of March they arrived at Easter Island, before which time the captain was tolerably recovered. Here they made but few discoveries farther than determining the situation of it to be in S. Lat. 27\u00b0 5' 30\" and W. Long. 109\u00b0 46' 20\". The island itself was found barren and desolate, having every appearance of being lately ruined by a volcanic eruption; without either wood, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>, or fresh water worth taking on board. The inhabitants were few in number; and the women in island, very small proportion to the men, but remarkable for their lewdness. A number of gigantic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> were observed, which had also been taken notice of by Commodore Roggewein, and the origin of which could not be accounted for.\n\nOn leaving Easter Island, Captain Cook was again attacked by his bilious disorder; but happily recovered before he reached the Marquesas, which they did on the 6th and 7th of April. One of these, Marquesa, being a new discovery, received the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOOD_S_ISLAND\">Hood's Island</a>, from the young gentleman by whom it was first observed. These are five in number; situated between 9\u00b0 and 10\u00b0 degrees of south latitude, and between 138\u00b0 47' and 139\u00b0 13' of west longitude. They were discovered by Mendana a Spaniard; and their names are, La <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGDALENA\">Magdalena</a>, St Pedro, La <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMINICA\">Dominica</a>, Santa <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTINA\">Christina</a>, and Hood's Island. The inhabitants are, without exception, the finest race of people in the South sea, surpassing all others in that part of the world in the symmetry of their persons and regularity of their features. Their origin, however, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> of language, was evidently the same with that of Otaheite. It was in St Christina that our commander anchored; and he has left particular directions for finding a particular cove in Resolution bay in that island, which is the most convenient for procuring wood and water.\n\nIn the passage from the Marquesas to Otaheite, our navigators passed several low and small islands connected together by reefs of coral rocks. One of these, named by the inhabitants Tiouka, was visited by Lieutenant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COOPER\">Cooper</a>. It was discovered and visited by Captain Byron; and is situated in S. Lat. 27\u00b0 30' W. Long. 144\u00b0 56'. The inhabitants are much darker in their complexions, and seem to be of a fiercer disposition than those of the neighbouring islands. They have the figure of a fish marked upon their bodies; a very proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMBLEM\">emblem</a> of their profession, deriving their subsistence almost entirely from the sea. Passing by St George's islands, which had been also discovered and named by Captain Byron, our commander now discovered four others, which he named Palliser's Islands. One of these is situated in S. Lat. 15\u00b0 26' and W. Long. 146\u00b0 20'; another in S. Lat. 15\u00b0 27' and W. Long. 146\u00b0 3'. They were inhabited by people resembling those of Tiouka, and like them were armed with long pikes. Here our navigator observes, that from W. Long. 138\u00b0 to 148\u00b0 or 150\u00b0, the sea is so full of small low islands, that one cannot proceed with too much caution.\n\nOn his arrival in Otaheite, provisions were met with in great plenty; and they were now very acceptable, Otaheite, by reason of the long time the ship had been at sea without obtaining any considerable supply. Two goats which had been given by Captain Furneaux to a chief named Otoo, appeared to be in a very promising situation. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> had brought forth two kids, which were almost large enough to propagate; and as she was again with kid, there was little doubt that the island...\nCook's island would soon be stocked with these useful animals; though it was otherwise with the sheep, all of which had died except one. On this occasion, also, the captain furnished the natives with cats, of which he gave away twenty; so that there was little danger of the stock of these animals decaying. During his residence at this time, he had an opportunity of making some computation of the number of inhabitants on the island, which he supposed to be no less than 200,000.\n\nHuahine and Ulietea islands were next visited, but without any remarkable occurrence. From the latter our commander set sail on the 5th of June 1774; and next day came in sight of Howe island, discovered by Captain Wallis, and situated in S. Lat. 16\u00b0 46' and W. Long. 154\u00b0 8'. On the 16th a new island, named Palmerstone Island, was discovered in S. Lat. 18\u00b0 4' W. Long. 163\u00b0 10'; and, four days after, another was observed in S. Lat. 19\u00b0 1' W. Long. 169\u00b0 37'. As it was evidently inhabited, the captain determined to land; but found the people so extremely hostile, that no intercourse could be had; nay, he himself was in danger of losing his life by a lance thrown by one of the natives, which passed close over his shoulder. From the extreme hostility of the people of this island, it was named by Captain Cook Savage Island. It is of a round shape, pretty high, and has deep water close to the shore, but has no good harbour.\n\nPassing by a number of small islands, Captain Cook next anchored at that of Anamocka or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROTTERDAM\">Rotterdam</a>, discovered by Tasman. It is situated in 20\u00b0 15' S. Lat. and 174\u00b0 31' W. Long. Its form is triangular, each side extending about three and a half or four miles. From the north-west to the south it is encompassed by a number of small islands, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>-banks, and breakers; of which no end can be seen from the island on the northern side, and may possibly be as far extended as Amsterdam or Tongataboo. While the captain remained on this island, he learned the names of more than 20 of the adjacent isles, some of which were in sight between the north-west and north-east. Two of these, which lie more to the westward than the others, are named Amatafoa and Ogbo. They are remarkable for their height; and from a great smoke visible about the middle of Amatafoa, it was supposed to have a volcano. The island of Rotterdam, Middleburg, or Eaoowe, with Pitlart, form a group extending about three degrees of longitude, and two of latitude. The whole group was named The Friendly Isles by Captain Cook, on account of the friendship which seemed to subsist among the inhabitants, and their courteous behaviour to strangers. The people of Rotterdam island are similar to those of Amsterdam; but the island is not in such a state of high cultivation as Amsterdam, nor do its fruits come to such perfection. It is also inferior in the articles of cloth, matting, &c., which are accounted the wealth of these parts.\n\nFrom Rotterdam island our navigator continued his course to the westward, where he first discovered a small island in S. Lat. 19\u00b0 43' W. Long. 178\u00b0 2'. It was named Turtle island, from the great number of these animals found upon it. Sixteen days after he fell in with the cluster of islands named by M. Bougainville the Great Cyclades. The first island on which he landed was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MALLICOLLO\">Mallicollo</a>, where, though the people were at first very hostile, they were soon conciliated, and a friendly intercourse took place. The language of these people is considerably different from that of the other South sea islands; they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTIVE\">diminutive</a> in their persons, and of ugly features; their hair black or brown, short and curling, but less soft than that of the negroes. They had no name for a dog in their language, and had never seen the animal; so that they were extremely fond of a dog and bitch, of which Captain Cook made them a present. The harbour in this island, in which the ship came to an anchor, was named Sandwich harbour, and lies on the north-east side, in S. Lat. 16\u00b0 25' 20\" E. Long. 167\u00b0 57' 53\". It is very commodious for the carrying on any operations at land, having a good depth of water, and many other advantages.\n\nThe next discovery was that of the group named Shepherd's Isles, in honour of Dr Shepherd, Plumian professor of astronomy at Oxford. Numbers more were every day observed; of which one peaked rock, named the Monument, was uninhabited, being apparently inaccessible to any other creature but birds. Sandwich island is of a considerable extent, and exhibits a most beautiful prospect. It is surrounded with other smaller islands, the principal of which were named Montague and Hinchinbrooke. At Erromango they found the people hostile and treacherous; and from a skirmish they had with them near a promontory on the north-east point of the island it was named Traitor's Head. Its situation is in S. Lat. 10\u00b0 43' E. Long. 169\u00b0 28'.\n\nFrom Erromango our navigator proceeded to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAN\">Tan</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TANNA\">Tanna</a>, an island they had formerly discovered at a distance, and which is surrounded by some others, three of which are named Immer, Footoona or Erronan, and Anatoom. At Tanna they stayed for some time, on account of their wanting some quantity of wood. A volcano was seen about the middle of this island, which burned with great violence, particularly in moist and wet weather; but notwithstanding the friendly terms on which they were with the natives, the latter would never allow them to approach this mountain. There were some spots on the sea-coast which emitted an hot and sulphurous smoke; and the people also expressed much uneasiness when they were approached or meddled with. The port which the ship entered in this island was named Revolution Harbour, and is situated in S. Lat. 19\u00b0 32' 25\" E. Long. 169\u00b0 44' 35\". It is a small creek three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of a mile long, and about half as broad. It is extremely convenient, having plenty of wood and water close to the shore. Among the vegetable productions of this island, there is reason to suspect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUTMEG\">nutmeg</a> tree to be one, a pigeon having been shot, in the craw of which was a wild nutmeg. The inhabitants are two distinct races of people, and speak two different languages; one that of the Friendly islands, the other peculiar to Tanna and those in the neighbourhood. The people are very expert in the use of their weapons; on which Mr. Wales makes the following remarks: \"I must confess I have often been led to think the feats which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a> represents his heroes as performing with their spears, a little too much of the marvellous to be admitted in an heroic poem, I mean when confined within...\"\nCook's within the strait stays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>; nay, even so great an advocate for him as Mr Pope acknowledges them to be surprising; but since I have seen what these people can do with their wooden spears, and them badly pointed, and not of an hard nature, I have not the least exception to any one passage in that great poet on this account. But if I see fewer exceptions, I can find infinitely more beauties in him, as he has, I think, scarcely an action, circumstance, or description of any kind whatever relating to a spear, which I have not seen and recognized among these people; as their whirling motion and whistling noise as they fly; their quivering motion in the ground when they fall; their meditating their aim when they are going to throw; and their shaking them in their hand as they go along.\n\nThe Archipelago, in which Captain Cook had now remained a considerable time, is situated between 14\u00b0 29' and 20\u00b0 4' S. Lat. and between 166\u00b0 41' and 170\u00b0 21' E. Long. extending 125 leagues in the direction of N. N. W. \u00bd W. and S. S. E. \u00bd E. The principal islands are the Peak of the Etol\u00e9, Terra del Espiritu Santo, Mallicollo, St Bartholomew, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of Lepers, Aurora, Whitfuntide isle, Ambrym, Paom, Ap\u00e9e, Three Hills, Sandwich, Erramango, Tanna, Immer, and Anatom. They were first discovered in 1656 by Quiros, who supposed them to be part of a southern continent; nor were they visited from that time till the year 1768, when M. Bougainville bestowed upon them the name of the Great Cyclades, as already mentioned. This gentleman, however, besides landing in the isle of Lepers, only discovered that the country was not connected, but consisted of islands. Captain Cook examined the whole in such an accurate manner, ascertaining the situation of many of the islands, and discovering such numbers of new ones, that he thought he had an undoubted right to impose a new name upon them, and therefore called them the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBRIDES\">Hebrides</a>.\n\nFrom the New Hebrides Captain Cook set sail for New Zealand, in order to prosecute his voyage in search of a southern continent, but in three days discovered a large island, which he named New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALEDONIA\">Caledonia</a>; and which, next to New Zealand, is the largest in the Pacific ocean. It lies between 19\u00b0 37' and 22\u00b0 30' S. Lat. and between 163\u00b0 37' and 167\u00b0 14' E. Long, lying N. W. \u00bd W. and S. E. \u00bd E. extending about 87 leagues in that direction, though its breadth does not anywhere exceed 10 leagues. The natives are strong, active, well made, and seem to be a middle race between those of Tanna and the Friendly isles; and the women were more chaste than those of the islands farther to the eastward. The island afforded a considerable variety of plants for the botanists, and some excellent timbers of the species of the pitch pine, for masts and spars. The wood is close-grained, white, and tough; and very fit for the purpose. One of the small islands surrounding the large one was named the Isle of Pines, from the quantity of these trees found upon it; and another, from the number and variety of plants it afforded, had the name of Botany island. The coast, however, was so dangerous, that our navigator, having no more time to spare, was obliged to leave some part of it unexplored, though the extent was determined, as has been already related. Mr Forster was of opinion, that the language of this people is totally different from that of any of the other South Sea islands.\n\nProceeding from New Caledonia, our navigator next fell in with an island about five leagues in circumference, and of a good height, situated in S. Lat. 29\u00b0 2' 30\" and E. Long. 168\u00b0 16' 3\"; on which he bestowed the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORFOLK\">Norfolk</a> Island. It was entirely uninhabited. Various trees and plants common at New Zealand were observed here, particularly the flax plant, which is more luxuriant in this island than in any part of New Zealand. The chief produce of the island is a kind of spruce-pine, many of the trees of which are 10 or 12 feet in circumference. The palm-cabbage likewise abounds here; and the coasts are well stocked with excellent fish. On the 18th of October they arrived at Queen Charlotte's Sound in New Zealand; Arrival at the situation of which was now ascertained by Mr New Zealand-Wales with the utmost accuracy, its latitude being found 41\u00b0 5' 56\" S. and its longitude 174\u00b0 25' 7\u00bd E. On examining the gardens which had been made, it was found that they were in a thriving condition, though they had been entirely neglected by the natives. Some of the cocks and hens were supposed to be still in existence, as a new laid hen's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a> was found, though none were seen.\n\nOn the 10th of November Captain Cook set sail from New Zealand in search of a southern continent; but having traversed a vast extent of sea for 17 days, from S. Lat. 43\u00b0 0' to 55\u00b0 48', he gave up all thoughts of finding any more land in this part of the ocean, and therefore determined to steer directly for the west entrance of the straits of Magellan, with a design of coaling the southern part of Terra del Fuego quite round Cape Horn to Le Maire's Straits. As the world had hitherto received but very imperfect accounts of this coast, he thought a survey of it would be of more advantage to navigation and geography than anything he could expect to meet with in a higher latitude. On the 17th of December he reached the coast of Terra del Fuego, and in three days more anchored in a place to which he gave the name of Christmas Sound. The land appeared desolate beyond anything he had hitherto experienced. It seems to be entirely composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROCKY_MOUNTAINS\">rocky mountains</a>, without the least appearance of vegetation. These mountains terminate in horrid precipices, the craggy summits of which rise up to a vast height; so that scarcely any thing in nature can have a more barren and savage prospect than the whole of the country. In the course of his voyage along this coast, he could not but observe, that at no time had he ever made one of such length where so little occurred of an interesting nature. Barren and dreary, however, as the coast was, it was not totally destitute of accommodations about Christmas Sound. Fresh water and wood for fuel were found about every harbour; and the country everywhere abounds with fowl, particularly geese. A considerable number of plants were also found upon it, almost every species of which was new to the botanists. In passing by Cape Horn, it was wished to determine whether it belonged to the land of Ter-Ramirez del Fuego, or to a small island south from it; but on a voyage this was found impracticable on account of the foggy weather and dangerous sea. Its latitude was now...\nnow determined to be $55^\\circ 38'$. S. and its longitude $67^\\circ 46'$. W. The coast appeared less dreary here than on the western side of Terra del Fuego; for though the summits of some of the hills were rocky, the sides and valleys seemed covered with a green turf and wooded in tufts. In passing this cape a remark was made by the captain, that if he were on a voyage round Cape Horn, to the west, and not in want of wood or water, or any other thing which might make it necessary to put into port, he would sail a considerable way to the southward, so as to be out of the reach of land altogether. By this method he would avoid the currents, whose force, he was of opinion, would be broken at 10 or 12 leagues distance from the shore, and farther off would be entirely destroyed. The extent of Terra del Fuego, and consequently of Magellan's Straits, was found to be less than what is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> laid down in maps and charts, and the coasts, in general, less dangerous than has been usually represented; though this must undoubtedly have been owing in a great measure to the weather, which happened to be remarkably temperate. In one of the small islands near Staten Land, and which from their being discovered on New Year's day, were called New Year's Isles, a remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> was observed among the animals of different species with which these desolate regions abound. The sea-lions occupy the greatest part of the sea-coast; the bears occupy the inland; the shags are posted in the highest cliffs; the penguins in such places as have the best access to and from the sea; and the other birds choose more retired places. Occasionally, however, all these animals were seen to mix together like domestic cattle and poultry in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> yard, without one attempting to hurt the other in the least. Even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAGLES\">eagles</a> and vultures were frequently observed sitting together on the hills among the shags, while none of the latter, either old or young, appeared to be disturbed at their presence. It is probable, therefore, that these birds of prey subsist by feeding on the carcases of the animals which die naturally or by various accidents, and which must be very numerous, from the immense quantity existing on the island.\n\nOur navigator now set out in quest of that extensive coast laid down in Mr Dalrymple's chart, and in which is marked the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> of St Sebastian; but when he came into the place where it is supposed to lie, neither land nor any certain signs of it could be met with. Some islands, however, were discovered, particularly Willis's island, in S. Lat. $54^\\circ$. W. Long. $38^\\circ$. 23'; another named Bird Island and South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEORGIA\">Georgia</a>, situated between $53^\\circ$. 57' and $54^\\circ$. 57'. S. Lat. and between $38^\\circ$. 13' and $35^\\circ$. 34'. W. Long. All these were covered with snow and ice to a great height. Not a tree was to be seen, not even a shrub, nor were there any rivulets or streams of water: the only vegetables to be met with were a coarse strong-bladed grass, wild burnet, and a kind of moss. A considerable quantity of seals and penguins were met with, whose flesh, though very coarse, was preferred by the ship's company, even by Captain Cook himself, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> provisions, which were now greatly decayed. The most southerly land discovered by our navigator was that on which he bestowed the name of Southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THULE\">Thule</a>, and which is situated in S. Lat. $59^\\circ$. 13'. 30'. W. Long. $27^\\circ$. 45'.\n\nThis was still more desolate than South Georgia, being forsaken even by the seals and penguins which are bounded on it. Not a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERB\">herb</a> of any kind was seen upon it, but vast high and barren mountains, the tops of some of which reached above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>; and it may be remarked, that this seems to be the only part of the world, hitherto discovered, entirely unfit for the support of animal life.\n\nSouthern Thule was discovered on the 31st of January 1775; and from this to the 6th of February several other islands were discovered, and named Cape <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a>, Cape Montague, Saunders's Isles, Candelmas Isles, and Sandwich's Land. With regard to this last, Capt. Cook was undetermined whether it was a group of islands or part of a continent lying near the pole, as after all his disappointments, he was still inclined to think that such a continent has an existence, on account of the vast quantity of ice met with in the southern seas; and which from its great height appears to be formed in bays and gulfs of the land, and not in the ocean itself. The greatest part of the southern continent, however, if it has any existence, must be within the polar circle, where the sea is so incumbered with ice, that the land must be inaccessible. So great is the danger in navigating these southern seas, that Captain Cook asserts on the most probable grounds in the world, that such lands as lie to the southward of his discoveries could not be explored; and that even no man would venture farther than he had done. Thick fogs, snow-storms, intense cold, and everything that can render navigation difficult or dangerous, must be encountered; all which difficulties are greatly heightened by the inexpressibly horrid aspect of the country itself. It is a part of the world doomed by nature never once to feel the warmth of the sun's rays, but to be buried in everlasting snow and ice. Whatever ports there may be on the coast, they are almost entirely covered with frozen snow of a vast thickness. If, however, any of them should be so far open as to invite a ship into it, she would run the risk of being fixed there for ever, or of coming out in an ice island. To this it may be added, that the islands and floats on the coast, the great falls from the ice-cliffs in the port, or a sudden snow-storm, might be attended with equally fatal effects. For these reasons our commander determined to abandon the pursuit of a land whose existence was so equivocal, but whose inutility, if it should be discovered, was certain. One thing only remained to complete what he wished to accomplish, and that was to determine the existence of Bouvet's land. In this inquiry he spent 16 days; but having run for 13 quarts of these directly in the latitude assigned to that land, and found no appearance of it or of Cape Circumcision, he concluded, that neither of them had any existence, but that the navigators had been deceived by the appearance of ice-islands. Two days more were spent in quest of some land which had been observed more to the southward, but with the like bad success; after which our commander abandoned all farther thoughts of southern discoveries, and prepared for returning to England. On his way home, however, he determined to direct his course in such a manner as to fall in with the isles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENIA\">Denia</a> and Marfeveen. These are laid down in Dr Halley's variation chart in latitude $41^\\circ$. 30'. S., and about $4^\\circ$. E. from the meridian of Marfeveen.\nof the Cape of Good Hope. None of these islands could be found; and therefore our commander, having very little time to spare either in searching for them or attempting to disprove their existence, made the best of his way to the Cape of Good Hope, and from thence to England. In his passage thither, he visited the isles of St. Helena, Ascension, and Fernando de Noronha. An experiment was made on the use of the still for procuring fresh water at sea; the result of which was, that though the invention was useful upon the whole, yet it would not by any means be advisable to trust entirely to it. Provided indeed that there was not a scarcity of fuel, and that the coppers were good, as much might thus be procured as would support life; but that no efforts would be sufficient to procure the quantity necessary for the preservation of health, especially in hot climates. He was likewise convinced that nothing contributes more to the health of seamen than having plenty of fresh water. His last stage in this second voyage before his arrival in England was at Fayal, one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AZORES\">Azores</a> islands; and his only design of stopping here was to give Mr. Wales an opportunity of finding the rate of the watches going, that so he might be enabled to find the longitude of these islands with the greater certainty.\n\nIn our commander's third voyage he touched at the island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TENERIFFE\">Teneriffe</a> instead of Madeira, looking upon the former to be a better place for procuring refreshments; and was convinced of the justness of his conjecture by the facility with which provisions of all kinds were obtained. The air of the country is exceedingly healthy, and proper for those subject to pulmonary complaints. This was accounted for by a gentleman of the place from the great height of the island, by which it was in the power of any person to change the temperature of the air as he pleased; and he expressed his surprise that physicians, instead of sending their patients to Nice or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a>, did not send them to Teneriffe. From the same gentleman it was learned, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a> shrub grows in that island as a common weed, which is constantly exterminated in large quantities. The Spaniards, however, sometimes use it as tea, and ascribe to it all the qualities of that brought from the East Indies. They give it also the name of tea, and say that it was found in the country when the islands were first discovered. Another botanical curiosity is the fruit called the impregnated lemon, which is a perfect and distinct lemon inclosed within another, and differing from the outer only in being a little more globular.\n\nFrom Teneriffe Captain Cook proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope, and from thence to the southward, where he fell in with two islands, the larger of which is about 15 leagues in circuit, and the smaller about nine; their distance from one another being about five leagues. The one of these islands lies in S. Lat. 46\u00b0 53', and E. Long. 37\u00b0 46'; the other in S. Lat. 46\u00b0 4', E. Long. 38\u00b0 8'. As the ships passed through between them, they could not discern either tree or shrub upon any of them, even with the assistance of their best glasses. The shore seemed to be bold and rocky, their internal parts full of mountains, whose sides and summits were covered with snow. These two, with four others, which lie from 9 to 12 degrees of longitude more to the east, and nearly in the same latitude, had been discovered in the year 1772 by Captain Marion du Fresne and Crozet, two French navigators, in their passage from the Cape of Good Hope to the Philippines. As no names had been assigned to them in a chart of the Southern ocean communicated to Captain Cook in 1775, the two larger ones were by him distinguished by the name of Prince Edward's islands, in honour of his majesty's fourth son; the other four, with a view to commemorate the discoverers, were called Marion's and Crozet's islands.\n\nFrom these our commander steered to the southward voyage in search of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KERGUELEN_S_LAND\">Kerguelen's land</a>, which he had been instructed to touch at, in order to discover, if possible, ten's land, a good harbour there. In his passage to it several new islands were discovered; one, to which Kerguelen had given the name of the Island of Rendezvous, Captain Cook, on account of its shape, changed to that of Bligh's Cap. It is situated in S. Lat. 48\u00b0 29', E. Description Long. 68\u00b0 40' and is a high round rock, inaccessible to that to all creatures but birds. Next day he fell in with Ker-guelen's land, at first thought to be a part of the southern continent, but afterwards found by Kerguelen himself to be an island. The extent of it, however, was not determined either by the French navigator or by Captain Cook. The former reckons it at 200 leagues in circumference, but Captain Cook estimates it at much less. Our navigator could not get any extensive view of it on account of the foggy weather; but as far as could be discovered, it was barren and desolate, inasmuch that there was neither food nor covering for cattle of any kind, so that they would inevitably perish if any were left. Even the sea-coasts were in a great measure destitute of fish; but the shore was covered with innumerable multitudes of seals, together with penguins and other birds; all of which were so void of fear that any quantity whatever might be killed without any difficulty. Not a single tree nor shrub could be seen, nor a piece of drift wood on the shore; and herbage of every kind was likewise very scarce. A prodigious quantity of the sea-weed called by Sir Joseph Banks <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUCUS\">fucus</a> giganteus, was found in one of the bays. The whole variety of plants found in this island did not exceed sixteen or eighteen species. The harbour in which our navigator made his longest stay on this desolate coast was named Port Pallyser, and is situated in S. Lat. 49\u00b0 3', E. Long. 69\u00b0 37'. In this voyage our navigator undoubtedly displayed superior nautical abilities to those of M. Kerguelen, who in two voyages to the place had never been able to bring his ships to anchor on any part of the coast.\n\nFrom Kerguelen's land our navigator proceeded to the coast of New Holland, where he now touched at the southern part called Van Diemen's Land, where he anchored in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVENTURE_BAY\">Adventure bay</a>. Here they found plenty of wood and water, with abundance of grass, coarse indeed, where they went first ashore, but afterwards much finer and proper for the cattle. Here, as everywhere else, the latitudes and longitudes were settled with the greatest exactness. The bottom of Adventure bay was found to lie in S. Lat. 43\u00b0 21', E. Long. 147\u00b0 29'. The inhabitants visited them in a friendly manner, but seemed as stupid and inoffensive as those they had formerly seen. They seemed to be totally ignorant of the use of iron, and set no value upon anything in the ornamental way excepting beads;\nbeads; nor did they seem to be acquainted even with the use of fish hooks. Here they found the stories of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> fauns and satyrs living in hollow trees realized. Some huts covered with bark, and of a most wretched <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, were indeed found near the shore; but the most commodious habitations were afforded by the largest trees. These had their trunks hollowed out by fire to the height of six or seven feet; and there was room enough in one of them for three or four persons to sit round a hearth made of clay; and it may justly seem surprising, that notwithstanding the extreme violence offered to the vegetative powers of the tree by forming this habitation, it still continued to flourish in consequence of one side being left entire.\n\nThe people, notwithstanding their extreme barbarity, were supposed to proceed from the same stock with those of the South Sea islands. As in one of their visits the natives had seized upon two pigs which had been brought ashore, apparently with an intention to kill them, the commander determined to make them a present of these animals; though from their excessive stupidity and inattention there was no probability of their allowing them to propagate, if they had been put directly into their hands. To prevent this, Captain Cook ordered the two they had attempted to seize, being a boar and a sow, to be carried about a mile within the head of the bay, and saw them left by the side of a fresh water rivulet. He was prevented from leaving any other species by a consideration of the barbarity of the inhabitants.\n\nFrom New Holland our navigator proceeded to New Zealand, where he arrived on the 12th of February 1777, and anchored in Queen Charlotte's sound. Here he was desirous of leaving a further supply of animals; but the inhabitants had hitherto shown such carelessness about those which had been left, that he durst not venture to leave any other than two goats, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> and a female with kid, and two hogs, a boar and sow. He was informed, however, that one chief had several cocks and hens in his possession, so that there was some probability of these animals being allowed to multiply; and as ten or a dozen hogs had at different times been left by Captain Cook, besides those put on shore by Captain Furneaux, it seems also to be likely that this race of creatures will increase either in a wild or domestic state, or both. The gardens had still been almost totally neglected, and some of them destroyed. Those which remained, however, produced cabbages, onions, leeks, parsnips, radishes, and a few potatoes. These last had been brought from the Cape of Good Hope, and were so greatly mellowed by the change of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, that with proper cultivation they seemed to bid fair for excelling those of other countries.\n\nOur navigator's next course was towards the island of Otaheite; in the run to which he discovered the island of Mangae, situated in S. Lat. 22\u00b0 57' E. Long. 201\u00b0 53'. From thence he proceeded to Watea, where Omai, now on his way home, recognized three of his countrymen, natives of the Society islands, who had arrived here by the following accident. About 12 years before, 20 of the natives of Otaheite had embarked in a canoe, in order to visit the neighboring island of Ulietea. A violent storm arose, which drove them out of their course, and they suffered incredible hardships by famine and fatigue, so that the greatest part of them perished. Four men continued hanging by the side of the vessel for four days after it was overtaken, when they were at last brought within sight of the people of this island. The latter immediately sent out their canoes, and brought them ashore, treating them afterwards with so much kindness, that the three who now survived expressed no desire of returning to their own country, though they had now an opportunity, but chose rather to remain where they were. This island is situated in S. Lat. 20\u00b0 1' E. Long. 201\u00b0 45', and is about 6 leagues in circumference. The inhabitants are said to be equally amiable in their persons and dispositions.\n\nVisiting a small island named Wenooa-ele, or Onokotia, situated in S. Lat. 19\u00b0 15' and E. Long. 201\u00b0 37', our commander found it without inhabitants, though there were undoubted marks of its being occasionally frequented. Harvey's island, which in his former voyage had been destitute of inhabitants, was now found to be well peopled; but the inhabitants showed such an hostile disposition that no refreshments could be procured; for which reason it was determined to steer for the Friendly islands, where there was a certainty of meeting with an abundant supply. In his way thither he touched at Palmerstone island, from a small island near which a supply of 1200 cocoa nuts was obtained\u2014a proper ed, besides abundance of fish and birds of various kinds, place of Had the island been capable of furnishing water, the refreshment, but captain would have preferred it to any of the inhabited ones for the purpose of procuring refreshments, as water, they could be had in any quantity without molestation from the petulance of the inhabitants. As water at this time happened to be a scarce article, our navigator was obliged to supply himself from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> which fell, and which afforded as much in an hour as he could procure by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a> in a month.\n\nDuring the time of residence at the Friendly islands, our navigator visited one named Hepace, at which no European ship had ever touched before. Here he was entertained in a friendly manner, supplied with refreshments, and left some useful animals. Great additions were made to the geography of these islands, and many curious remarks made on the inhabitants and natural products. It was observed by Mr. Anderson, that the people had very proper notions of the immateriality and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a> of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>; and he thought himself authorized to assert that they did not worship any part of the visible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>.\n\nPassing by a small island named Towbouai, about five or six miles in extent, and situated in S. Lat. 23\u00b0 25' of Omai at E. Long. 210\u00b0 37', our navigator now arrived at Ota-Heiheite. Here Omai met with his relations, some of whom received him with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> indifference; but his meeting with an aunt and a sister was marked with expressions of the most tender regard. It was Hua-Heiheite, however, that was destined for the place of Omai's final residence, and thither the captain repaired on purpose to settle him. The affair was conducted with great solemnity; and Omai brought with him a suitable assortment of presents to the chiefs, went through a great number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> ceremonies, and made a speech, the subject of which had been dictated to him by Captain Cook. The result of the negociation was, that a spot of ground was assigned to him, where...\nhim, extending about two hundred yards along the shore of the harbour, with a proportionable part of an adjacent hill. The carpenters of both ships were then employed in constructing a house for him, in which he might secure his European commodities. At the same time a garden was made for his use, in which were planted flax, vines, pine-apples, melons, and several other garden vegetables. Here he met with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, sister, and sister-in-law, by whom he was very affectionately received; but it was discovered with concern, that none of his relations were able to protect him in case of any attack on his person or property; so that there was too much reason to fear that he would be plundered immediately on the departure of the English. To prevent this, if possible, Captain Cook advised him to conciliate the favour and engage the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> and protection of some of the most powerful chiefs by proper presents; at the same time that he himself took every opportunity of letting the inhabitants know that it was his intention to return to the island again, and if he did not find Omai in the same state of security in which he left him, those by whom he had been injured would certainly feel the weight of his resentment. About a fortnight after leaving Huahine, the captain had a message from Omai; in which he informed him that everything went well, only that his goat had died in kidding, for which he desired another might be sent; and accompanied this request with another for two axes, which were sent along with a couple of kids, male and female. On taking his final leave of the Society islands, Captain Cook observes, that it would have been far better for these poor people never to have known the superiority of the Europeans in such arts as render life comfortable, than after once being acquainted with it to be again abandoned to their original incapacity of improvement; as, if the intercourse between them and us should be wholly discontinued they could not be restored to that happy state of mediocrity in which they were found. It seemed to him that it was become in a manner incumbent on the Europeans to visit these islands once in three or four years, in order to supply them with those conveniences of which they have taught them the use. It is indeed to be apprehended, that by the time the iron tools which were then among them are worn out, they will have forgotten the use of their own; as in this last voyage it was observed that the use of their former tools was almost totally abolished.\n\nHaving left the Society islands, Captain Cook now proceeded to the northward, crossing the equator on the 22d and 23d of December; and on the 24th discovered a low uninhabited island about 15 or 20 leagues in circumference. Here the longitude and latitude were exactly determined by means of an eclipse of the sun. The west side of it, where the eclipse was observed, lies in N. Lat. 1\u00b0 39' E. Long. 202\u00b0 30'. From the time of its discovery it obtained the name of Christmas Island. Plenty of turtle was found upon it, and the captain caused the seeds of the cocoa-nut, yams, and melons, to be planted.\n\nProceeding still to the northward, our navigator next fell in with five islands, to which he gave the general name of Sandwich Isles, in honour of his patron. Their names in the language of the country are Woa-hoo, Atoo, Onecheew, Oreehoua, and Tchoora. They are situated in the latitude of 21\u00b0 30' and 22\u00b0 15' North, and between 199\u00b0 20' and 201\u00b0 30' E. Long. The longitude was deduced from no fewer than 72 sets of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> observations. The largest of these islands is Atoo, and does not in the least resemble the other islands of the South sea formerly visited by our navigator, excepting only that it has hills near the centre, which slope gradually towards the sea-side. The only domestic animals found upon it were hogs, dogs, and fowls. Captain Cook designed to have made the inhabitants of this island a present of some others; but being driven out of it by storms of weather, he was obliged to land them upon a smaller one named Onecheewou. They were a he-goat with two females, and a boar and sow of the English breed, which is much superior to that of the South sea islands. He left also the seeds of melons, pumpkins, and onions. The soil of this island seemed in general to be poor; it was observable that the ground was covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a> and plants, some of which had a more delicious fragrance than had been experienced before. The inhabitants of these islands are much commended, notwithstanding their horrid custom of eating human flesh. In every thing manufactured by them there is an ingenuity and neatness in an uncommon degree; and the elegant form and polish of some of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a>-hooks could not be exceeded by an European artificer, even assisted by all his proper tools. From what was seen of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> also, it appeared that they were by no means novices in that art, and that the quantity and goodness of their vegetable productions might with propriety be attributed as much to their skilful culture as to the fertility of the soil. The language of the Sandwich Isles is almost identically the same with that of Otaheite.\n\nProceeding farther to the northward, our navigators American discovered the coast of New Albion on the 7th of March 1778. Its appearance was very different from that of Yared, the countries with which they had hitherto been conversant. The land was full of mountains, the tops of which were covered with snow; while the valleys between them, and the grounds on the sea-coast, high as well as low, were covered with trees, which formed a beautiful prospect as of one vast forest. The place where they landed was situated in N. Lat. 44\u00b0 33' E. Long. 235\u00b0 20'. At first the natives seemed to prefer iron to every other article of commerce; but at last they showed such a predilection for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, that scarcely a bit of it was left in the ships except what belonged to the necessary instruments. It was observed also, that these people were much more tenacious of their property than any of the savage nations that had hitherto been met with, inasmuch that they would part neither with wood, water, grass, nor the most trifling article, without a compensation, and were sometimes very unreasonable in their demands; with which, however, the captain always complied as far as was in his power.\n\nThe place where the Resolution was now anchored was by our navigator called St George's Sound, but he found afterwards understood that the natives gave it the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOOTKA\">Nootka</a>. Its entrance is situated in the east corner of Hope Bay, in N. Lat. 49\u00b0 33' E. Long. 233\u00b0 12'. The climate, as far as they had an opportunity of observing it, was much milder than that on the eastern coast of the climate.\ncoast of the American continent in the same parallel of latitude; and it was remarkable that the thermometer, even in the night, never fell lower than 42\u00b0, while in the day-time it frequently rose to 60\u00b0. The trees met with here are chiefly the Canadian pine, white cypresses, and some other kinds of pine. There seemed to be a scarcity of birds, which are much harassed by the natives, who ornament their clothes with the feathers, and use the flesh for food. The people are no strangers to the use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, having iron tools in general use among them; and Mr. Gore procured two silver spoons of a construction similar to what may be observed in some Flemish pictures, from a native who wore them round his neck as an ornament. It is most probable that these metals have been conveyed to them by the way of Hudson's Bay and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANADA\">Canada</a>; nor is it improbable that some of them have been introduced from the north-western parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a>.\n\nWhile Captain Cook sailed along this coast, he kept always at a distance from land when the wind blew strongly upon it; whence several large gaps were left unexplored, particularly between the latitudes of 50\u00b0 and 55\u00b0. The exact situation of the supposed straits of Anian was not ascertained, though there is not the least doubt, that if he had lived to return by the same way in 1779, he would have examined every part with his usual accuracy. On departing from Nootka sound, our navigator first fell in with an island in N. Lat. 59\u00b0 49', E. Long. 216\u00b0 58', to which he gave the name of Kay's Island. Several others were discovered in the neighbourhood; and the ship came to an anchor in an inlet named by the captain Prince William's Sound. Here he had an opportunity of making several observations on the inhabitants, as well as on the nature of the country. From everything relative to the former, it was concluded, that the inhabitants were of the same race with the Esquimaux or Greenlanders. The animals were much the same with those met with at Nootka, and a beautiful skin of one animal, which seemed to be peculiar to the place, was offered to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>. Mr. Anderson was inclined to think that it was the same to which Mr. Pennant has given the name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANAAN\">canaan</a> marmot. The alcedo, or great kingfisher, was found here, having very fine and bright colours. The humming bird also came frequently, and flew about the ship when at anchor; though it is scarce to be supposed that it can live throughout the winter on account of the extreme cold. The water-fowl were in considerable plenty; and there is a species of diver which seemed to be peculiar to the place. Almost the only kinds of fish met with in the place were torik and hokut. The trees were chiefly the Canadian and spruce pine, some of which were of a considerable height and thickness. The sound is judged by Captain Cook to occupy a degree and a half of latitude and two of longitude, exclusively of its arms and branches, which were not explored. There was every reason to believe that the inhabitants had never been visited by any European vessel before; but our navigator found them in possession not only of iron but of beads, which it is probable are conveyed to them across the continent from Hudson's Bay.\n\nSoon after leaving Prince William's Sound, our navigators fell in with another inlet, which it was expected would lead either to the northern sea or to Hudson's or Bassin's Bay; but upon examination it was found to end in a large river. This was traced for 210 miles from the mouth, as high as N. Latitude 61\u00b0 30', and promises to vie with the most considerable ones already known, as it lies open by means of its various branches to a very considerable inland communication. As no name was given by our commander to this river, it was ordered by Lord Sandwich to be named Cook's River. The inhabitants seemed to be of the same race with those of Prince William's Sound; and like them had glass beads and knives; they were also clothed in very fine furs; so that it seemed probable that a valuable fur-trade might be carried on from that country. Several attempts have accordingly been made from the British settlements in the East Indies to establish a traffic of that kind; but little benefit accrued from it except to the proprietors of the first vessel, her cargo having greatly lowered the price of that commodity in the Chinese market. It must be observed, that on the western side of the American continent, the only valuable skins met with are those of the sea-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OTTER\">otter</a>; those of the other animals, especially foxes and martens, being of an inferior quality to such as are met with in other parts.\n\nProceeding farther to the northward, our navigators now fell in with a race of people who had evidently visited the islands discovered by the Russians, and seemed to have adopted from them some improvements in dress, &c. In the prosecution of this part of their voyage, it appeared firm that they had been providentially conveyed in the dark through a passage so dangerous, that our commander would not have ventured upon it in the daytime. They were now got in among those islands which had lately been discovered by Captain Beering and other Russian navigators, and came to an anchor in a harbour of Oonalashka, situated in N. Lat. 53\u00b0 55', E. Long. 193\u00b0 30'. Here it was remarked that the inhabitants had as yet profited very little by their intercourse with the Russians; so that they did not even dress the fish they used for their food, but devoured them quite raw.\n\nFrom Oonalashka our navigator proceeded again towards the continent, which he continued to trace as far as possible to the northward. In N. Lat. 54\u00b0 48', E. Long. 195\u00b0 45', is a volcano of the shape of a perfect cone, having the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRATER\">crater</a> at the very summit. On the coast farther to the north the soil appears very barren, producing neither tree nor shrub, though the lower grounds are not destitute of grass and some other plants. To a rocky point of considerable height, situated in N. Lat. 58\u00b0 42', E. Long. 197\u00b0 36', our commander gave the name of Cape Newnham.\n\nHere Mr. Anderson, the surgeon of the Resolution, died of consumption, under which he had laboured for more than twelve months. Soon after he had breathed his last, land being seen at a distance, it was named Anderson's Island; and on the 9th of August the ship anchored under a point of the continent, which he named Cape Prince of Wales. This is remarkable for being the most westerly point of the American continent of Wales, hitherto known. It is situated in N. Lat. 65\u00b0 46', E. Long. 191\u00b0 45'. It is only 39 miles distant from the eastern coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>; so that our commander had the pleasure of ascertaining the vicinity of the two main continents to each other, which had only been imperfectly\nCook's feats done by the Russian navigators. Setting sail from this point next day, he steered to the west and north, when he soon fell in with the country of the Tschutki, which had been explored by Beering in 1728. Here he had an opportunity of correcting M. Stechlin's map, who had placed in these seas an imaginary island, on which he bestowed the name of Alyeckha. Being convinced that the land he had now reached was part of the Asiatic continent, our commander directed his course eastward, in order to fall in with that of America; and on the 17th reached the latitude of 70\u00b0 33' and E. Long. 197\u00b0 41'. Here they began to perceive that brightens in the horizon called by mariners the blink of the ice; and in 70\u00b0 41' they had got quite up to it, so that no farther progress could be made. Next day they made a shift to get as far as 70\u00b0 44'; but the ice was now so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> as a wall, and about ten or twelve feet in height. Its surface was extremely rugged, and farther to the northward appeared much higher. Its surface was covered with pools of water; and great numbers of sea-lions lay upon it, whose flesh they were now glad to use as food. Our commander continued to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> the icy sea till the 29th; but the obstructions becoming every day greater and greater, it was thought proper to give over all further attempts of finding a passage to Europe for that year. He did not, however, omit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of the Asiatic and American coasts until he had fully ascertained the accuracy of Captain Beering's accounts as far as he went, and corrected the errors of M. Stechlin. Great additions were thus made to the geographical knowledge of this part of the globe; and Mr. Coxe observes, that \"it reflects no small honour upon the British name, that our great navigator extended his discoveries much farther in one expedition, and at so great a distance from the point of his departure, than the Russians accomplished in a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of years, and in parts belonging or contiguous to their own empire.\"\n\nAn end of this celebrated navigator's discoveries, however, was now at hand. From Beering's straits he sailed for Oonalasuka, where he arrived on the 2d of October, and laid for some time in order to repair his ships. While the carpenters were employed in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, one-third of the people had permission to go on shore by turns, in order to gather berries, with which the island abounds, and which, though now beginning to decay, were of great service, in conjunction with the spruce-beer, to preserve the people from the scurvy. Such a quantity of fish was likewise procured, as not only served to supply the ships for the present, but likewise allowed a great number to be carried out to sea; so that hence a considerable saving was made of the provisions of the ships, which was an article of very considerable consequence. On the 8th of the month our commander received a very singular present from some persons unknown, by the hands of an Oonalasuka man named Derramoufik. It consisted of a rye loaf, or rather a salmon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATE\">pate</a> in the form of a loaf, and highly seasoned with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>. This man had the like present for Captain Clerke, and each of them was accompanied with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> which none on board could understand: a few bottles of rum, with some wine and porter, were sent in exchange: it being supposed that such a present would be more acceptable than any other thing that could be spared. Corporal Lediard of the marines, an intelligent man, was at the same time directed to accompany Derramoufik, for the purpose of gaining a more satisfactory account of the country. On the tenth of the month he returned with three Russian seamen or furriers, who with several others resided at Egocchac, where they had a dwelling-house, some store houses, and a sloop about 30 tons burden. One of these people was either master or mate of the vessel, and all of them were very sober and decent in their behaviour. The greatest difficulty arose from the want of an interpreter; for which reason the conversation was carried on by signs. However, the captain obtained a sight of two sea-charts, both of which he was allowed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a>. One of them included the sea of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENINSULA\">Peninsula</a>, part of the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a> down to the latitude 41\u00b0; the Kurile islands, and the peninsula of Kamtchatka. The other comprehended all the discoveries that had been made from the time of Captain Beering to the year 1777; but these were found to be very trifling. Indeed our navigator was assured by all the Russians whom he had occasion to see, that they knew of no other islands than those laid down in the charts just mentioned, and that none of them had ever seen any part of the American continent excepting what lies opposite to the country of the Tschutki. With regard to the natives character of Oonalasuka, they are to appearance the most inoffensive and peaceable people in the world, not to be bitants in a state of civilization; though perhaps this may be owing in some measure to the connexion they have long had with the Russians. From the affinity observed between the language of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUINOX\">Equinox</a> Greenlanders, and those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTON\">Norton</a>'s found in N. Lat. 64\u00b0 55', there is great reason to believe that all those nations are of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a>; and if that be the case, there is little reason to doubt that a communication by sea exists between the eastern and western sides of the American continent; which, however, may very probably be shut up by ice in the winter time, or even for the most part throughout the year.\n\nThe return of Captain Cook to the Sandwich Islands, with the lamentable catastrophe that ensued, have been already related under the former article. We shall now briefly enumerate the consequences of his discoveries with respect to the advancement of science. These are principally his having overthrown the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> of a southern continent of immense extent, usually spoken of under the name of Terra Australis incognita; his demonstration of the impracticability of a northern passage either by Asia or America to the East Indies; and his having established a sure method of preserving the health of seamen through the longest sea-voyages. It is remarked by the bishop of Carlisle, that one great advantage resulting from the late surveys of the globe, is the refutation of fanciful theories, too likely to give birth to impracticable undertakings. The ingenious reveries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> philosophers will now be obliged to submit, perhaps with reluctance, to the sober dictates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and experience; nor is it only by discouraging future unprofitable searches that the late voyages are likely to be of service to mankind, but likewise by lessening the dangers.\nCook's dangers and distresses formerly experienced in those discoveries, seas which are within the actual line of commerce and navigation.\n\nThe interests of science, as well as of commerce, are highly indebted to the labours of our illustrious navigator. Before his time almost half the surface of the globe was involved in obscurity and confusion; but now such improvements have been made, that geography has assumed a new face, and become in a manner a new science; having attained such completeness as to leave only some less important parts to be explored by future voyagers. Other sciences besides geography have been advanced at the same time. Nautical astronomy, which was in its infancy when the late voyages were undertaken, is now brought to much greater perfection; and, during Captain Cook's last expedition, many even of the petty officers could take the distance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> from the sun or from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a>, the most delicate of all observations, with sufficient accuracy; and the officers of superior rank would have been ashamed to have it thought that they did not know how to observe for, and compute, the time at sea; a thing before hardly mentioned among seamen. It must, however, be remembered, that a great part of the merit in this respect is due to the board of longitude. In consequence of the attention of that board to the important object just mentioned, liberal rewards have been given to mathematicians for perfecting the lunar tables and facilitating calculations; and artists have been amply encouraged in the construction of watches, and other instruments better adapted to the purposes of navigation than any that formerly existed.\n\nA vast addition of knowledge has been gained with respect to the ebbing and flowing of the tides; the direction and force of the currents at sea; the nature of the polarity of the needle, and the cause of its variations. Natural knowledge has been increased by experiments on the effects of gravity in different and very distant places; and from Captain Cook's having penetrated so far into the southern regions, it is now ascertained, that the phenomenon usually called the aurora borealis, is not peculiar to high northern latitudes, but belongs equally to all cold climates, whether north or south.\n\nNo science, however, perhaps stands more indebted to these voyages than that of botany. At least 1200 new species of plants have been added to those formerly known; and every other department of natural history has received large additions. Besides all this, there have been a vast many opportunities of observing human nature in its different situations. The islands visited in the middle of the Pacific ocean are inhabited by people who, as far as could be observed, have continued unmixed with any different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> since their first settlement. Hence a variety of important facts may be collected with respect to the attainments and deficiencies of the human race in an uncultivated state, and in certain periods of society. Even the curiosities brought from the newly discovered islands, and which enrich the British museum and the late Sir Ashton <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVER\">Lever</a>'s (now Mr Parkinson's) repository, may be considered as a valuable acquisition to this country, and affording no small fund of instruction and entertainment.\n\nThere are few inquiries more generally interesting than those which relate to the migrations of the various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> by which the different parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> have been peopled. It was known in general, that the Asiatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> called the Malayans possessed in former times much the greatest trade of the Indies, and that their ships frequented not only all the coasts of Asia, but even those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a> likewise, and particularly the large island of Madagascar; but that from Madagascar to the Marquesas and Easter island, that is, nearly from the east side of Africa till we approach the west coast of America, a space including almost half the circumference of the globe, the same nation of the oriental world should have made their settlements, and founded colonies throughout almost every intermediate stage of this immense tract, in islands at amazing distances from the mother continent, is a historical fact that before Captain Cook's voyages could not be known, or at least but very imperfectly. This is proved, not only by a similarity of manners and customs, but likewise by the affinity of language; and the collections of words which have been made from all the widely-diffused islands and countries visited by Captain Cook, cannot fail to throw much light on the origin of nations, and the manner in which the earth was at first peopled.\n\nBesides this, information has been derived concerning another family of the earth formerly very much unknown. This was the nation of the Esquimaux or Greenlanders, who had formerly been known to exist only on the north-eastern part of the American continent. From Captain Cook's accounts, however, it appears, that these people now inhabit also the coasts and islands on the west side of America opposite to Kamtchatka. From these accounts it appears also, that the people we speak of have extended their migrations to Norton sound, Oonalashka, and Prince William's sound; that is, nearly to the distance of 1500 leagues from their stations in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENLAND\">Greenland</a> and the coast of Labrador. Nor does this curious fact rest merely on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> arising from the similitude of manners; for it stands confirmed by a table of words, exhibiting such an affinity of language as must remove every doubt from the mind of the most scrupulous inquirer.\n\nFrom the full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of the vicinity of the two great continents of Asia and America, it can no longer be supposed ridiculous to believe, that the latter received its inhabitants from the former; and by the facts recently discovered, a degree of further evidence is added to those which might formerly be derived from nature concerning the authenticity of the Mosaic accounts. It is not indeed to be doubted, that the inspired writings will stand the test of the most rigorous investigation; nor will it ever be found, that true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> and Divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">Revelation</a> can militate against each other. The rational friends of religion are so far from dreading the spirit of inquiry, that they wish for nothing more than a candid and impartial examination of the subject, according to all the lights which the improved reason and enlarged science of man can afford.\n\nAnother good effect of the voyages of Captain Cook is, that they have excited in other nations a zeal for similar undertakings. By order of the French government, Messrs de la Peyrouse and de Langle sailed from Brest in August 1785, in the frigates Bouffle and Astrolabe, on an enterprise, the purpose of which was\nto improve geography, astronomy, natural history, and philosophy, and to collect an account of the customs and manners of different nations. For the more effectual prosecution of the design, several gentlemen were appointed to go out upon the voyage, who were known to excel in different kinds of literature. The officers of the Bouffole were men of the best information and firmest resolution; and the crew contained a number of artificers in various branches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>. Marine watches, &c., were provided, and M. Dagelet the astronomer was particularly directed to make observations with M. Condamin's invariable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a>, to determine the difference in gravity, and to ascertain the true proportion of the equatorial to the polar diameter of the earth. It has likewise been made evident, that notwithstanding all that has been done by Captain Cook, there is still room for a farther investigation of the geography of the northern parts of the world. The object accordingly was taken up by the empress of Russia, who committed the care of the enterprise to Captain Billings an Englishman in her majesty's service. We shall only make one observation more concerning the benefits likely to accrue from the voyages of Captain Cook, and that is relative to the settlement in Botany bay. Whatever may be supposed to accrue to the nation itself from this settlement, it must undoubtedly give the highest satisfaction to every friend to humanity to be informed, that thus a number of unhappy wretches will be effectually prevented from returning to their former scenes of temptation and guilt, which may open to them the means of industrious subsistence and moral reformation. If the settlement be conducted with wisdom and prudence, indeed it is hard to say what beneficial consequences may be derived from it, or to what height it may rise. Rome, the greatest empire the world ever saw, proceeded from an origin little, if at all, superior to Botany bay. For an account of this settlement see the article New-Holland.\n\nOne other object remains only farther to be considered with regard to these voyages, and that is the advantages which may result from them to the discovered people. Here, however, it may perhaps be difficult to settle matters with precision. From the preceding accounts, it must be evident that the intentions of Captain Cook were in the highest degree benevolent; and if at any time the people were the sufferers, it must have been through their own fault. In one instance indeed it might be otherwise, and that is with respect to the venereal disease. The evidence in this case cannot be altogether satisfactory. Mr Samwell, who succeeded Mr Anderson as surgeon of the Resolution, has endeavoured to show, that the natives of the lately explored parts of the world, and especially of the Sandwich islands, were not injured by the English; and it was the constant care and solicitude of Captain Cook to prevent any infection from being communicated to the people where he came. But whether he was universally successful in this respect or not, it is evident that the late voyages were undertaken with a view exceedingly different from those of former times. The horrid cruelties of the Spanish conquerors of America cannot be remembered without concern for the cause of religion and human nature; but to undertake expeditions with a design of civilizing the world, and meliorating its condition, is certainly a noble object. From the long-continued intercourse between this country and the South sea islands, there cannot be any doubt that some degree of knowledge must already have been communicated to them. Their stock of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> must naturally be enlarged by the number of uncommon observations which has been presented to them, and new materials furnished for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of their rational faculties. A considerable addition must be made to their immediate comfort and enjoyment by the introduction of useful animals and vegetables; and if the only benefit they should ever receive from Britain should be the having obtained fresh means of subsistence, this of itself must be considered as a valuable acquisition. Greater consequences, however, may soon be expected. The connexion formed with these people may be considered as the first step towards their improvement; and thus the blessings of civilization may be spread among the various tribes of Indians in the Pacific ocean, which in time may prepare them for holding an honourable place among the nations of the earth.\n\nAs a supplement to this account of the discoveries made by Captain Cook himself, we shall here subjoin a Captain Clerke, &c., until the return of the ships to England. At the time of Captain Cook's death, the great point of a north-west passage remained in some measure to be still determined: for though, by the event of the former attempt, it had been rendered highly improbable that they should succeed in this, it was still resolved to try whether or not, at certain seasons of the year, the ice might not be more open than they had hitherto found it. The first object that naturally occurred, however, was the recovery of Captain Cook's body; for which Mr King was of opinion that something for vigorous measure ought instantly to be pursued. His motives for this, besides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> regard he had for the captain, were to abate the confidence which must be supposed to ensue on the part of the natives, by which would probably incline them to dangerous attempts; and this the more particularly, as they had hitherto discovered much less fear of the fire arms than other savage nations were accustomed to do. Mr Samwell also takes notice of the intrepidity of the natives in this respect; but ascribes it, in the first instance, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of their effects; and in the next, to a notion, that as the effects of these arms were occasioned by fire, they might be counteracted by water. For this purpose they dipped their war-mats in water; but finding themselves equally vulnerable after this method had been pursued, they became more timid and cautious.\n\nAs matters stood at present, there was even reason to dread the consequences of a general attack upon the ships; and therefore Mr King was the more confirmed in his opinion of the necessity of doing something to convince them of the prowess of their adversaries. In these apprehensions he was seconded by the opinion of the greater part of the officers on board; and nothing seemed more likely to encourage the islanders to make the attempt than an appearance of being inclined to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>, which they would certainly attribute to weakness or fear. Captain Clerke, however, and those who were in favour of conciliatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, urged\nCook's Difcoveries urged, that the mischief was already irreparable; that the natives, by reason of their former friendship, had a strong claim to the regard of the English; and that the more particularly, as the late calamitous accident did not appear to have taken its rise from any premeditated design: they urged also the ignorance of the king concerning the theft, and the mistake of the illanders who had armed themselves on a supposition that some attempt would be made to carry off the king. To all this was added, that the ships were in want of refreshments, particularly water; that the Resolution's foresail would require seven or eight days before it could be properly repaired; and as the spring was fast advancing, the speedy prosecution of the voyage to the northward ought now to be the only object; that a vindictive contest with the natives might not only justify an imputation of needless cruelty, but would occasion great delay in the equipment of the ships.\n\nIn consequence of the prevalence of these sentiments lenient measures were adopted, though the behaviour of the natives continued to be very insolent. A great body (still kept possession of the shore; many of whom came off in their canoes within pistol-shot of the ships, and provoking the people by every kind of insult and defiance. A train of negotiations for Captain Cook's body took place; in which the natives showed the most hostile and treacherous disposition, and, as afterwards appeared, had cut the flesh from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> and burnt it. A piece of about ten pounds weight was brought by two natives at the hazard of their lives, who gave information that the rest had been burnt, and that the bones were in the possession of the king and some of the principal chiefs. Information was given, at the same time, that the chiefs were very devious of war, in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> the death of their countrymen.\n\nThus it appeared that the pacific <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> had answered no good purpose. No satisfactory answer had been given to the demands made of the bodies of the slain; nor was any progress made in the great work intended, viz. a reconciliation with the natives; they still remained on shore in a hostile posture, as if determined to oppose any endeavours that might be made by our people to land; at the same time that a landing was become absolutely necessary, in order to complete the stock of water. Had this spiritless conduct been persisted in, there is not the least doubt that neither this purpose nor any other could have been effected. The insolence of the natives became every day greater and greater; insomuch that one of them had the audacity to come within musket shot of the Resolution, and, after throwing several stones, waved Captain Cook's hat over his head, while his countrymen on shore were exulting and encouraging his audacity. By this insult the people were so highly enraged, that coming on the quarter-deck in a body, they begged that they might no longer be obliged to put up with such reiterated provocation, but might be allowed to make use of the first opportunity of revenging the death of their captain. The necessity of more vigorous measures, therefore, being now apparent, a few discharges of the great guns, with the burning of a village and some other acts of severity, at last produced the mangled remains of Captain Cook. They were wrapped up in a bundle, in which were found both his hands entire, which were easily known by a scar in one of them dividing the fore-finger from the thumb the whole length of the metacarpal bone. Along with these was the skull, but with the scalp separated from it, and the bones of the face wanting; the scalp, with the ears adhering to it, and the hair cut short; the bones of both the arms, and the skin of the fore-arms hanging to them; the bones of the thighs and legs joined together, but without the feet. The ligaments of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> were observed to be entire; the whole showing evident marks of being in the fire, except the hands which had the flesh remaining upon them, and were cut in several places and crammed with salt, most probably for the purpose of preserving them. The skull was not fractured; but the scalp had a cut in the back part of it. The lower jaw and feet were wanting, having been seized by different chiefs.\n\nHaving accomplished the purposes of their stay in Unsuccess this place, Captain Clerke set sail from Karakakooa bay (attempts in Owhyhee towards Mowee, with a design to explore the coasts of that island more fully than had been done, but were unable to accomplish their purpose; nor indeed was it in their power to accomplish any discovery of consequence among these islands. The only intelligence worth mentioning which they were able to procure was, that wars had ensued about the property of the goats which were left by Captain Cook on the island of Onecheew, as has been already mentioned, and that during the contest, all these poor animals, who had already begun to multiply, were destroyed; so that the benevolent attempts of our illustrious navigator in favour of these illanders had proved abortive.\n\nOn quitting the island of Onecheew, our navigators set sail for another named Modopappo, which they were assured by the natives lay within five hours sailing of Tahoora, a small island in the neighbourhood of Onecheew. In this they proved unsuccessful; on which it was determined to steer for the coast of Kamtschatka. In the passage thither they arrived at the place where De Gama is said to have discovered a great extent of land; but of this they could discover no appearance. This imaginary continent is said to have been discovered by a navigator called John de Gama, but who seems also to have been imaginary, as no person can find out either the country where he lived, or the time when he made the discovery. We are informed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULLER\">Muller</a>, that the first account of it was published by Texeira in a chart of 1649, who places it between the latitude of 44 and 45 degrees, and about 160 east longitude, and calls it \"land seen by John de Gama, in a voyage from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a> to New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>.\" By the French geographers it is removed five degrees farther to the east. When they arrived at Kamtschatka they were entertained in the most hospitable manner, and furnished with every thing that reception could be procured in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> and barren region, beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> barbarous and inhospitable, out of the reach of civilization, bound and barricaded with ice, and covered with summer snow, we experienced the tenderest feelings of humanity, joined to a nobleness of mind and elevation of sentiment which would have done honour to any clime.\nCook's clime or nation.\" From Major Behm, in particular, they received so many and so great obligations, that an handsome acknowledgment was made him by the Royal Society, as has been already observed. Even the sailors were so struck with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>, that they voluntarily requested that their allowance of grog might be withheld, in order to compliment the garrison of Bolcheretisk with the spirits; saying, that they knew brandy was extremely scarce in that country, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> on shore having offered four roubles a bottle for it. The officers, however, would not allow them to suffer by their generosity in this inclement country and season of the year (the month of March not being yet expired); but in room of the small quantity of brandy which Major Behm consented to accept, substituted an equal quantity of rum.\n\nIt is worth observing, that the kindness with which the empress had ordered the British navigators to be treated in this part of her dominions was amply rewarded, even with no less than the addition of a new kingdom to the Russian empire, which hitherto her arms had not been able to subdue. Among the northern Asiatics none had been able to maintain their independence except the Tchutski, who inhabit the north-east extremity of the continent. No attempt to subdue these people had been made since the year 1750, when the Russian forces had at last been obliged to retreat, after having lost their commanding officer. The Russians afterwards removed their frontier fortresses from the river Anadyr to the Ingiga, which runs into the northern extremity of the sea of Okotsk, and gives its name to a gulf to the west of the sea of Penneshawk. On the day that Captains Clerke and Gore arrived at Bolcheretisk, Major Behm received dispatches from this fort, acquainting him that a party of the Tchutski had been there with voluntary offers of friendship and tribute. That on asking the reason of such an unexpected alteration in their sentiments, they had acquainted his people that two large Russian boats had visited them towards the end of the preceding summer; that they had been shown the greatest kindness by the people who were in them, and had entered into a league of amity with them; and that, in consequence of this, they came to the Russian fort in order to settle a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> upon terms agreeable to both nations. This incident had occasioned much speculation, and could never have been understood without the assistance of those who were now present: the large Russian boats having been in truth no other than the Resolution and Discovery, under Captains Cook and Clerke.\n\nAbout the middle of May the snow began to melt very fast in this inhospitable region, and the ships being now on their passage northward, met with an excellent opportunity of supplying themselves with fish. The beach was cleared of ice on the 15th of the month; from which time vast quantities came in from every quarter. Major Behm had ordered all the Kamtschadals to employ themselves in the service of the English ships; so that often they found it impossible to take on board the quantities that were sent. They chiefly consisted of herrings, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TROUT\">trout</a>, flat fish, and cod. These fish were here found in such plenty, that once the people of the Discover surrounded such an amazing quantity with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEINE\">seine</a>, that they were obliged to throw out a very considerable number, lest the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> should have been broken to pieces; and the cargo was still so abundant, that, besides having a stock for immediate use, they filled as many casks as they could conveniently spare for salting; and after sending on board the Resolution a tolerable quantity for the same purpose, they left behind several bushels on the beach.\n\nWhile they remained in this country an opportunity offered of observing the pernicious effects of spirituous liquors in producing the sea-fever. All the Russian soldiers were in a greater or lesser degree afflicted with that disorder, some of them being in the last stage of it; and it was particularly observed that a sergeant, with whom our people had kept up a most friendly intercourse, had, in the course of a few days, brought upon himself the most alarming febrile symptoms, by drinking too freely of the liquors with which he had been presented by the English. Captain Clerke soon relieved them, by putting them under the care of the surgeons of the ships, and supplying them with sour-kraut, and malt for sweet-wort. In consequence of this a surprising alteration was soon observed in the figures of most of them; and their speedy recovery was principally attributed to the sweet wort.\n\nOn the 12th of June they began to proceed northward along the coast of Kamtschatka, and three days after had an opportunity of observing an eruption of one of the volcanoes of that peninsula. On the 15th before daylight, they were surprised with a rumbling noise like distant thunder; and when the day appeared, found the decks and sides of the ships covered near an inch thick with fine dust like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMERY\">emery</a>. The air at the same time loaded and obscured with this substance; and in the neighbourhood of the volcano itself it was so thick that the body of the hill could not be discovered. The explosion became more loud at 12 o'clock, and during the afternoon, being succeeded by showers of cinders, generally of the size of pease, though some were as large as hazel-nuts. Along with these there also fell some small stones which had undergone no alteration from the action of the fire. In the evening there were dreadful claps of thunder, with bright flashes of lightning, which, with the darkness of the sky, and the sulphurous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> of the air, produced a most awful and tremendous effect. The ships were at this time about 24 miles distant from the volcano; and it appeared that the volcanic shower had been carried to a still greater distance, as they next day found the bottom of the sea to consist of such small stones as had fallen upon the decks of the ships. The mountain was still observed to be in a state of eruption on the 18th.\n\nFor some time Captain Clerke kept the coast of Kamtschatka in view, with a design to make an accurate survey of it; but in this he was disappointed by the foggy and squally weather; however, he determined the position of some remarkable promontories, and at last finding the season too far advanced to accomplish his design, set sail for Bering's straits, chiefly with a view to ascertain the situation of the projecting points of the coast.\n\nOn the 3d of July our navigators came in sight of the\nquish all hopes of proceeding farther on the American side. Another effort was still resolved on to try the practicability of a north-west passage; and for this purpose our navigators altered their direction on the 21st of July, passing through a great quantity of loose ice. About ten at night the main body was discovered at a very small distance, so that they were obliged to proceed to the southward. During this perilous navigation, the Discovery, after having almost got clear out from the ice, became so entangled by several large pieces, that her progress was stopped, and she immediately dropped to leeward, falling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROADSIDE\">broadside</a> foremost on the edge of a considerable body of ice, on which she struck with violence, there being an open sea to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINDWARD\">windward</a>. At length the ship was either broken or moved so far, that the crew had an opportunity of making an effort to escape. But unluckily, before the ship gathered way sufficient to be under command, she fell to leeward a second time upon another piece of ice; and the swell rendering it unsafe to lie to windward, and finding no prospect of getting clear, they pushed into a small opening, and made the vessel fast to the ice with hooks. Here the Resolution for some time lost sight of her consort, which occasioned no small uneasiness in both vessels; but at length, on a change of wind, the Discovery, setting all her sails, forced a passage, though not without losing a considerable part of her sheeting, and becoming very leaky by reason of the blows she had received.\n\nThus the two vessels continued to make every effort to penetrate through the immense quantities of ice with which those seas are filled winter and summer, but without success. Captain Clerke therefore finding that it was impossible either to get to the northward, or even to reach the Asiatic continent, the ships being also greatly damaged, determined to proceed southward to the bay of Avatika, on the Kamtschadale coast, to rest, and afterwards take a survey of the coasts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAPAN\">Japan</a> before the winter should set in.\n\nDuring this navigation, two general conclusions were adopted relative to the extent of the Asiatic coast, in opposition to the opinion of Mr Muller. One is, that the promontory, called the East Cape, is in reality the most easterly point of Asia; and that no part of that quarter of the globe extends farther than the longitude of $190^\\circ 22'$ E. The other conclusion is, that the latitude of the most north-easterly point of Asia does not exceed $70^\\circ$ N. but is rather somewhat below it. As the present discoveries, however, were terminated on the Asiatic side in the 60th degree of latitude, the probable direction of the coast afterwards can only be conjectured. The only sources of knowledge in this case are the Russian charts and journals; and these in general are so defective and contradictory, that the particulars of their real discoveries can scarce be collected. Hence the Russian geographers are greatly divided in their opinions concerning the extent and figure of the peninsula of the Tschutski. Mr Muller, in a map published 1751, supposes it to extend north-east as far as the latitude of $75^\\circ$, and E. Long. $19^\\circ$ ending in a round cape, which he calls Tschukofsko Nos. To the southward of this cape he supposes the coast to form a bay to the west, bounded in the latitude of $67^\\circ 18'$ by Serdze Kamen, the most northerly point observed by Beering in his expedition in 1728. A new form is given to the whole peninsula in a map published by the academy at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETERBURGH\">Peterburgh</a> in 1776. Here its most north-easterly extremity is placed in N. Lat $73^\\circ$. E. Long. $178^\\circ 30'$; and its most easterly point in N. Lat. $65^\\circ$. E. Long. $189^\\circ 30'$. All the other maps vary between these two situations; and the only thing in which all of them agree is the position of the East cape in N. Lat. $66^\\circ$. The form of the coast, however, is very erroneous in the map published by the academy, and may be entirely disregarded. In Mr Muller's map, the northern part of the coast has some resemblance to that laid down in Captain Cook's and Clerke's survey, as far as the latter extends; only that Mr Muller does not make it trend sufficiently to the west, but supposes it to recede only five degrees of longitude between the latitudes of $66^\\circ$ and $69^\\circ$; whereas it really recedes almost ten.\n\nWe must next examine Mr Muller's authority for supposing the coast to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> round to the north and north-east in such a manner as to form a large promontory. Mr Cox, whose accurate researches into this matter must give great weight to his opinion, thinks, that the extremity of the promontory was never doubted by any person except Defnesh and his party; who sailed, in the year 1648, from the river Kovyma, and are imagined to have got round to the river Anadyr. The account of this voyage, however, gives no geographical delineation of the coast, so that its figure must be determined by other circumstances; and from these it evidently appears, that the Tschukofsko Nos. of Defnesh is in reality the East cape of Captain Cook. Speaking of this nos., he says, that a person, with a favourable wind, may sail from the isthmus to the Anadyr in three days and three nights. This agrees entirely with the situation of the East cape, which is about 120 leagues from the mouth of the river Anadyr; and there being no other isthmus to the north between that and the latitude of $69^\\circ$, it seems evident, that by this description he certainly means either the East cape or some other situated to the southward of it. In another place he says, that opposite to the isthmus there are two islands upon which some of the Tschutski nation were observed, having pieces of the teeth of sea-horses fixed in their lips; and this exactly coincides with the two islands that lie to the south-east of the East cape. Our navigators indeed did not observe any inhabitants upon these islands; but it is by no means improbable, that some of those of the American coast, whom the above description perfectly suits, might have accidentally been there at the time, and been mistaken for a tribe of Tschutski.\n\nOther circumstances, though less decisive than those just mentioned, concur in the same proof. Defnesh says, that in sailing from the Kovyma to the Anadyr, a great promontory, which projects far into the sea, must be doubled; and that this promontory extends between north and north-east. From these expressions, perhaps, Mr Muller was induced to represent the country of the Tschutski in the form we find in his map; but if he had been acquainted with the position of the East cape as determined by Captain Cook, and the striking agreement between that and the promontory or isthmus in the circumstances above-mentioned,\nit is most probable that he would not have deemed these expressions of sufficient weight to authorize his extending the north-eastern extremity of Asia either as far to the north or to the east as he has done.\n\nAnother authority used by Mr Muller seems to have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> of the Cossack Popoff, taken at the Anadirskoi Ostrog in 1711. Popoff was sent by land, in company with several others, to demand tribute of the independent Tchukotki tribes, who inhabited the country about the Nefs. In the account of this journey, the distance between Anadirsk and Tchukotkoi Nefs is represented as a journey of ten weeks with loaded rein-deer. From such a vague account, indeed, we can judge but very little; but as the distance between the East cape and Anadirsk does not exceed 200 leagues, and consequently might be accomplished in the space above mentioned at the rate of 12 or 14 miles a day, we cannot reckon Popoff's account of its situation inconsistent with the supposition of its being the East cape. It may likewise be observed, that Popoff's route lay along the foot of a rock named Matkol, situated at the bottom of a spacious gulf, which Muller supposes to have been the bay he lays down between the latitudes of 66\u00b0 and 72\u00b0; and he accordingly places the rock Matkol at the centre of it; but it seems more probable that it might be a part of the gulf of Anadyr, which they would undoubtedly pass in their journey towards the East cape.\n\nBut what seems to put the matter beyond all doubt, and to prove that the cape which Popoff visited cannot be to the northward of 69\u00b0 Lat. is that part of his deposition which relates to an island lying off the Nefs, from whence the opposite coast might be discerned; for as the opposite continents, in the latitude of 69\u00b0, diverge so far as to be upwards of 100 leagues distant, it is highly improbable that the Asiatic coast should again trend eastward in such a manner as to come almost in sight of that of America. As an additional proof of the position in question, we may observe, that the Tchukotkoi Nefs is constantly laid down as dividing the sea of Kovyma from that of Anadyr; which could not possibly be the case if any large cape had projected to the north-east in the higher latitudes.\n\nThe next question to be determined is, to what degree of latitude the northern coast of Asia extends before it inclines directly westward? Captain Cook was always strongly inclined to believe, that the northern coast of this continent, from the Indigirka eastward, has hitherto been usually laid down above two degrees to the northward of its true situation; for which reason, and on the authority of a map that was in his possession, as well as from intelligence received at Oonalashka, he placed the mouth of the Kovyma in the latitude of 68\u00b0. Should he be right in his conjecture, it is probable that the coast of Asia does not anywhere extend beyond the latitude of 70\u00b0 before it trends to the west; and consequently our navigators must have been only one degree from its northern extremity. This seems to be confirmed by the silence of the Russian navigators concerning any extent of continent to the northward of Shelatfko Nefs; nor do they mention any remarkable promontory, except the East cape between the Anadyr and the Kovyma. Another particular which Deshneff relates may perhaps be deemed a further confirmation of this opinion, viz. that he met with no obstruction from ice in sailing round the northern extremity of Asia; though he adds, that this sea is not at all times free of it, which indeed appears evidently to be the case. That part of the continent which lies between Cape North and the mouth of the Kovyma is about 125 leagues in extent. A third part of this space, from Kovyma eastward, was explored in the year 1723 by Feodor Amstif, who informed Mr Muller that its direction was easterly. Since that time it has been surveyed with some accuracy by Shalauroff, whose chart makes it trend north-east-by-east as far as Shelatfko Nefs, which he places at the distance of about 43 leagues east of the Kovyma. The space therefore, between the Nefs and Cape North, somewhat more than 80 leagues, is the only part of the Russian dominions now remaining unexplored. But if the Kovyma be erroneously laid down in point of longitude as well as latitude, a supposition far from being improbable, the extent of the undiscovered coast will be considerably diminished.\n\nThe following are the reasons why it may be supposed that the mouth of the Kovyma is placed too far to the westward in the Russian charts: 1. Because the accounts that have been given of the navigation of the Frozen ocean from that river round the north-eastern extremity of Asia to the gulf of Anadyr, do not agree with the supposed distance between those places. 2. Because the distance from the Anadyr to the Kovyma over land is by some Russian travellers represented as a journey of no very great length, and easily performed. 3. Because the coast from the Shelatfko Nefs of Shalauroff appears to trend directly south-east towards the East cape. From all which it may be inferred, with some degree of probability, that only 60 miles of the northern Asiatic coast remain to be explored.\n\nWith regard to a north-west passage from the Atlantic into the Pacific ocean, it is highly probable that no such thing exists to the southward of the 56th north degree of latitude. If, in reality, it exists anywhere, north-east it must certainly be either through Baffin's bay, or passage by the north of Greenland in the western hemisphere, to the Pacific ocean, or in the eastern, through the Frozen sea to the north of Siberia; so that in whichever continent it is seated the navigator must pass through Bering's straits.\n\nAll that remains now to be considered therefore is, the impracticability of penetrating into the Atlantic ocean through these straits. From the voyages of our navigators it appears, that the sea to the northward of Bering's straits is more free from ice in August than in July, and perhaps may be still more so in some part of September. But after the autumnal equinox the length of the day diminishes so fast, that no farther thaw can be expected; and it would be unreasonable to attribute to great an effect to the warmth of the last fortnight of September as to imagine it capable of differing the ice from the most northern part of the American coast. Even admitting this to be possible, it must at least be allowed that it would be highly imprudent to endeavour to avoid the Icy cape, by running to the known parts of Baffin's bay, a distance of about 1260 miles, in so short a time as that passage can be supposed to be open. On the side of Asia there appears still less probability of success, as appears from\nthe testimony of the Russian as well as the English navigators. The voyage of Dezhnev indeed proves the possibility of circumnavigating the north-eastern extremity of Asia; but even this affords a very slender foundation to hope for any great benefit, as no person besides himself appears to have succeeded in the attempt, though more than a century and a half has now elapsed since the time of his voyage. But even supposing that, in some very favourable season, this cape might be doubled, still the cape of Tai-mura remains, extending as far as the 78th degree of latitude, and round which none pretend ever to have failed.\n\nThese arguments seem conclusive against any expectation of a north-west or north-east passage to the East Indies, unless on the supposition of an open sea very near the polar regions. The probability of getting into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLAR_SEAS\">polar seas</a> is considered under the article Pole; and indeed from what has already been advanced must appear very little. Waving this subject therefore at present, we shall return to the remarks made by our navigators during their second voyage.\n\nIn this they did little more than confirm what had been observed during the first: for it never was in their power to approach the continent of Asia in any higher latitude than 67\u00b0, nor that of America in any part, excepting a few leagues, between 68\u00b0 and 68\u00b0 20', which they had not seen before. In both years the ice was met with sooner on the Asiatic than the American coast; but in 1779 they met with it in lower latitudes than in 1778. As they proceeded northward, the ice was found universally more compact and solid, though they were astonished at the same time that the greatest part of what they met with was moveable. Its height on a medium was estimated at eight or ten feet; though some of the highest might be about 16 or 18. The currents were generally at the rate of one mile in the hour, and more generally felt from the south-west than from any other quarter. Their force, however, was so inconsiderable, whatever their direction might be, that no conclusion could possibly be drawn from them concerning the existence or non-existence of a northern passage. With regard to the temperature of the weather, July was found much colder than August. In the former, the thermometer was once at 20\u00b0, and very frequently at 30\u00b0; whereas during the last year it was very uncommon in August to have it as low as the freezing point. High winds were experienced in both seasons, all of which blew from the south-west. The air was foggy whenever the weather became calm; but the fogs were observed to accompany southerly winds much more than others.\n\nThe straits, in the nearest approach of the continents to each other, in the latitude of 66\u00b0, are about 13 leagues over; beyond which they diverge to N. E. by E. and W. N. W.; so that in the latitude of 69\u00b0, their distance from each other is about 300 miles. A great resemblance is observed between the continents on both sides of the straits. Both are destitute of wood; the shores are low, with mountains further inland, rising to a great height. The soundings in the mid-way between them were from 29 to 30 fathoms, gradually decreasing as either continent was approached; with this difference, however, that the water was somewhat shallower on the coast of America than that of Asia, at an equal distance from land. The bottom, towards the middle, was a soft slimy mud; and near either shore was a brownish sand intermixed with a few shells and small fragments of bones. There was but little tide or current, and what there was came from the west.\n\nBefore the ships could reach the peninsula of Kamtchatka, Captain Clerke expired; in consequence of which the command of the Discovery devolved upon Mr King, Captain Gore being now the superior officer. On the return to Kamtchatka, Captain Clerke was buried in the spot on which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> was to be erected; it having been his own desire to be interred in the church.\n\nBy the time they arrived at this peninsula, the face of the country was greatly improved; the fields being covered with the most lively verdure, and every plant in the most flourishing state. The eruption of the bay volcano which they had observed on their last departure from Kamtchatka, had done little or no damage notwithstanding its violence. Several stones had fallen about the size of a goose's egg, but none larger. At this visit it was observed by our navigators, that the complexions of the Russians seemed to be much more unhealthy and fallow than when they saw them formerly; and the Russians made the same observation upon the complexions of their guests. As no certain cause for this alteration could be perceived, the blame was by both parties laid on the verdure of the country; which, by contrasting itself with the colour of the people, made the latter appear to disadvantage.\n\nHaving repaired as well as they could the damages sustained by the ships among the ice, our navigators now began to proceed on their voyage southward; but the shattered condition of their vessels, with the little time they had now to spare on voyages of discovery, after having been so long at sea, now rendered them much less successful than formerly. Before leaving the peninsula, however, they took care to give such a description of the bay of Awatska as must be of great service to future navigators. This bay lies in 52\u00b0 51' N. Lat. and 158\u00b0 48' E. Long, in the bight of another bay formed by Cape Gavaree to the south, and Cheeponkoi Nofs to the north. The latter of these bears from the former N. E. by N., and is 32 leagues distant. From Cape Gavaree to the entrance of Awatska bay the coast takes a northerly direction, and extends about 11 leagues. It consists of a chain of ragged cliffs and rocks, and in many parts presents an appearance of bays or inlets; but on a nearer view, low grounds were perceived by which the headlands were connected. From the entrance of Awatska bay, Cheeponkoi Nofs bears E. N. E. distant 17 leagues. The shore on this side is flat and low, with hills behind gradually rising to a considerable height. The latitude of Cape Gavaree is 52\u00b0 21'. By this remarkable difference of the land on both sides the cape, navigators may be directed in their course towards it from the southward. When they approach it from the northward, Cheeponkoi Nofs becomes very conspicuous; it being a high projecting headland, and united to the continent by a large extent of level ground lower than the Nofs; and presents the same appearance...\nShould the weather happen to be sufficiently clear to admit a view of the mountains both on the sea coast and in the neighbourhood, the situation of Awatika bay may be known by the two high ones to the south of it. That nearest the bay is in the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> loaf, the other flat at top, and not quite so high. Three very conspicuous mountains appear on the north side of the bay; of which that to the west appears to be the highest; the next, being a volcano, is readily known by the smoke which it emits; the third is the most northerly, and might properly be called a clutter of mountains, as it presents several flat tops to view.\n\nWhen got within the capes, the entrance of the bay of Awatika to the north is pointed out by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTHOUSE\">lighthouse</a> on a perpendicular headland. Many sunken rocks lie to the eastward of this headland, stretching two or three miles into the sea; and which with a moderate sea or swell will always show themselves.\n\nA small round island lies four miles to the south of the entrance, principally composed of high pointed rocks, one of which is very remarkable. The entrance into the bay is at first about three miles wide, and one and an half in the narrowest part; the length is four miles in a north-west direction. Within the mouth is a noble haven about 25 miles in circumference; in which are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a> of Rokoweera to the east, Tarcinika to the west, and St Peter and St Paul to the north.\n\nOn leaving Kamtchatka, it was unanimously judged improper to make any attempt to navigate the seas between the continent of Asia and Japan. Instead of this, it was proposed to steer to the eastward of that island, and in the way thither to sail along the Kuriles; examining particularly those that are situated nearest to the northern coast of Japan, which are said to be considerable, and neither subject to the Russians nor Japanese. In case they should have the good fortune to meet with some secure and commodious harbour in one of these islands, it was supposed that they might prove of considerable importance, as convenient places for shelter for subsequent navigators, who might be employed in exploring these seas, as the means of producing a commercial intercourse among the adjacent dominions of the two above-mentioned empires. The next object was to take a survey of the coasts of the islands of Japan; after which they designed to sail for the coast of China as far north as possible, and then fall along it southward to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACAO\">Macao</a>.\n\nIn pursuance of this plan, they sailed along the coast of Kamtchatka, till they came to the southern point called Cape Lopatka, whose situation they determined to be in Lat. 51\u00b0 0' E. Long. 156\u00b0 45'. To the north-west they observed a very lofty mountain whose summit was lost in the clouds; and the same instant the first of the Kurile islands, named Shoomka, made its appearance in the direction of west, half south.\n\nThe passage betwixt the southern extremity of Cape Lopatka and the island of Shoomka, though only one league in breadth, is extremely dangerous, both on account of the rapidity of the tides, and of the sunk rocks which lie off the cape. In the course of this voyage, they had occasion to observe, that a violent swell from the north-east frequently took place, though the wind had been for some time in the western quarter; a circumstance for which they seem to have been altogether unable to account.\n\nThe tempestuous weather which now occurred prevented any discoveries from being made among the Kurile islands; however, they again sailed over the space assigned to the land of De Gama, without being able to find it; and from comparing several accounts of the Russian navigators with one another, it was judged extremely probable, that the land of Jefo, so frequently laid down in former maps, is no other than the most southerly of the Kurile islands. On coming in view of the coast of Japan, they had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> to find that they could not approach the land by reason of the tempestuous weather and bad state of the ships; the coasts of these islands being extremely dangerous. Passing from thence in quest of the Bathee islands, they found amazing quantities of pumice-stone floating in the sea; so that they seemed inclined to believe, with Mr Muller, that if there had formerly been any part of the continent, or large island, called the Land of Jefo, it must have disappeared in a volcanic convulsion; which also must have been the case with that called the Company's Land and Staten Island. Though they had not the good fortune to find the Bathee islands, they discovered one in 24\u00b0 48' N. Lat. 141\u00b0 20' E. Long., which from its appearance, and the sulphurous smell emitted by it, they named Sulphur Island. After this nothing remarkable occurred till their arrival at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTON\">Canton</a> in China, where, having laid for some time in order to put their ships in repair, they at last set sail for Britain; but through fleets of weather were driven as far north as Stromness in Orkney. From thence Captain Gore sent a dispatch to the lords of the admiralty to inform them of his arrival; and on the 4th of October 1780 the ships reached the Nore, after an absence of four years, two months, and twenty-two days.","sp":233,"ep":271},{"h":"COOKERY","t":"the art of preparing and dressing victuals for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>: An art in its simplest and ordinary modes, sufficiently familiar to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>-keeper; and, in its luxurious refinements, too copiously detailed in manuals and directories published for the purpose, to require any enlargement here, were it even a topic that at all deserved consideration in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>.","sp":271,"ep":271},{"h":"COOLERS","t":"in Medicine, those remedies which were supposed to produce an immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, being such as have their parts in less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> than those of the organs of feeling; as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> and all acid liquors. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">Or</a> they are such as were supposed, by a particular viscosity or grossness of parts, to give the animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> a greater consistence than they had before, and consequently retard their motion, having less of that intestine force on which their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> depends: this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> was ascribed to cucumbers and similar substances.","sp":271,"ep":271},{"h":"COOMB","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Combs of corn, a dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> containing four bushels, a half or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>.","sp":271,"ep":271},{"h":"COOPER","t":"Anthony Ashley, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHAFTESBURY\">Shaftesbury</a>, was son of Anthony earl of Shaftesbury, and grandson of Anthony\nAnthony first earl of Shaftesbury, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> of England. He was born in 1671, at Exeterhouse in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, where his grandfather lived, who from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of his birth conceived so great an affection for him, that he undertook the care of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>; and he made so good a progress in learning, that he could read with ease both the Latin and Greek languages when only 11 years old. In 1683, his father carried him to the school at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINCHESTER\">Winchester</a>, where he was often insulted on his grandfather's account, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> was odious to the zealots for despotic power: he therefore prevailed with his father to consent to his desire of going abroad. After three years stay abroad, he returned to England in 1689, and was offered a seat in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> in some of those boroughs where his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> had an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>. But this offer he did not now accept, that he might not be interrupted in the course of his studies, which he prosecuted five years more with great vigour and success; till, on Sir John Trenchard's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, he was elected burgess for Pool. Soon after his coming into parliament, he had an opportunity given him of expressing that spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> by which he uniformly directed his conduct on all occasions. It was the bringing in and promoting \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> for regulating trials in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a>.\" But the fatigues of attending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of commons in a few years impaired his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, that he was obliged to decline coming again into parliament after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> in 1698. He then went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, where the conversation of Mr Bayle, Mr le Clerc, and several other learned and ingenious men, induced him to reside a twelvemonth. During this time, there was printed at London, in 8vo, an imperfect edition of Lord Ashley's Inquiry concerning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">Virtue</a>. It had been surreptitiously taken from a rough draught, sketched when he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more than 20 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. His lordship, who was greatly chagrined at this event, immediately bought up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> before many books were sold, and set about completing the treatise, as it afterwards appeared in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Characteristics. Soon after Lord Ashley's return to England, he became, by the decease of his father, earl of Shaftesbury. But his own private affairs hindered him from attending the house of lords till the second year of his peerage, when he was very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> to support <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> William's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, who was at that time projecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a>. So much was he in favour with King William, that he had the offer of secretary of state; but his declining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> would not allow him to accept it. Though he was disabled from engaging in business, the king consulted him on matters of very high importance; and it is pretty well known that he had the greatest share in composing that celebrated last speech of King William, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 31, 1701. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>'s accession to the throne, he returned to his retired manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, being no longer advised with concerning the public; and was then removed from the vice-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRALTY\">admiralty</a> of Dorset, which had been in the family for three generations. In 1703, he made a second journey to Holland, and returned to England the year following. The French prophets, soon after this, having by their enthusiastic extravagancies made a great noise throughout the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, and among different opinions, some advising a prosecution, the lord Shaftesbury apprehended that such measures tended rather to inflame than to cure the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>. This was the origin of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">Letter</a> concerning Enthusiasm, which he sent to Lord Somers, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>; and which being approved of by that nobleman and other gentlemen to whom it was shown, was published in 1708, though without the name of the author, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> that of the person to whom it was addressed. His Morality, a philosophical Rhapsody, being a recital of certain conversations on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> and moral subjects, appeared in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1709; and in the May following his Sentiments Concerning an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> upon the freedom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">Wit</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">Humour</a>, in a Letter to a Friend. It was in the same year that he entered into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> state with Mrs Jane Ewer, the youngest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Thomas Ewer, Esq., of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEE\">Lee</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HERTFORDSHIRE\">Hertfordshire</a>. By this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>, to whom his lordship was related, he had an only son, Anthony the late earl of Shaftesbury. In 1710, his Soliloquy, or Advice to an Author, was published at London in 8vo. While he was thus employing himself in literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, his health declined so fast, that it was recommended to him to seek assistance from a warmer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>. Accordingly, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1711, he set out for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>, and pursuing his journey by way of France, was obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Berwick's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, which at that time lay encamped near the borders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIEDMONT\">Piedmont</a>. Here he was entertained by that famous general in the most friendly manner, and every assistance was given him to conduct him in safety to the duke of Savoy's dominions. Our noble author's removal to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> was of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to the re-establishment of his health; for after having resided at Naples about a year and a half, he departed this life on the 4th of February, O.S. 1712-13, in the 42nd year of his age. The only pieces which he finished after he came to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, were the Judgment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>, and the Letter concerning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">Design</a>, which last was added to that impertinent of the Characteristics which appeared in 1732. It was in 1711 that the first edition was published of all the Characteristics together, and in the order in which they now stand. But this publication not being entirely to his lordship's satisfaction, he chiefly employed the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his life in preparing his writings for a more elegant edition; which was given to the world in 1713, soon after his decease. The several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a> that were then first interposed through the volumes were all invented by himself, and designed under his immediate inspection; and for this purpose he was at the pains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> up a most accurate set of instructions, the manuscript of which is still preserved in the family. That no mistakes might be committed, the earl did not leave to any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> so much as the drudgery of correcting the press. In the three volumes of the Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, and Times, he completed the whole of his works which he intended for the public eye. Not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before his death he had formed a scheme of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> a discourse on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>, and the other arts of design, which, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he had lived to have finished it, might have proved a very pleasing and useful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, as he had a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> in subjects of that kind; but his premature decease prevented his making any great progress in the undertaking. The earl of Shaftesbury had an esteem for the works of the best English divines; one remarkable instance of which was displayed in his writing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">Preface</a> to a volume of Dr Whichcot's\nWhichcot's Sermons, published in 1698. Copies of these sermons had been taken in short-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, as they were delivered from the pulpit; and the earl had so high an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of them, that he not only introduced them to the world by his preface, but had them printed under his own particular inspection. In his Letters to a Young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">Man</a> at the University, he speaks of Bishop Burnet and Dr Hoadly in terms of great applause, and has done <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to the merits of Tillotson, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARROW\">Barrow</a>, Chillingworth, and Hammond, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> pillars of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> against fanaticism. But whatever regard his lordship might have for some of our divines, it was to the writings of antiquity that his admiration was principally directed. These were the constant objects of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, and from them he formed his system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, which was that of the civil, social, and theistic kind.\n\nOf Lord Shaftesbury's character, as a writer, different accounts have been given. As one of his greatest admirers, may be mentioned Lord Monboddo; who, speaking of his Rhapsody in particular, does not hesitate to pronounce it not only the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a> in English, out of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>, but the sublimest philosophy; and, if we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> join with it the Inquiry, the completest system both of morality and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>, that we have in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, and, at the same time, of the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and elegance for the style and composition.\n\nEven several of the authors who have distinguished themselves by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> opposition to many of the sentiments which occur in the Characteristics, have nevertheless mixed no small degree of applause with their censures. \"I have again perused, with fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> and fresh concern (says Mr Balguy, in his Letter to a Deist), the volumes of Characteristics\u2014I heartily wish the noble author had been as unprejudiced in writing as I was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a>. If he had, I am persuaded his readers would have found <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> pleasure and double instruction. It seems to me, that his lordship had little or no temptation to pursue any singularities of opinion by way of distinction. His fine genius would sufficiently have distinguished him from vulgar authors in the high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>; on which account his deviations seem the more to be lamented. The purity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a> of his style, and the delicacy of his sentiments, are and must be acknowledged by all readers of taste and sincerity. But nevertheless, as his beauties are not easy to be overlooked, so neither are his blemishes. His works appear to be tainted with too many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> errors, and his fine thoughts are so often mingled with absurdities, that however we may be charmed with the one, we are forced to condemn the other.\" Mr Balguy hath farther observed, with regard to the Inquiry concerning Virtue, which is the immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his animadversion, that though he cannot agree in every particular contained in it, he finds little more to do than to tell how much he admires; and that he thinks it indeed, in the main, a performance so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> and exact as to deserve higher praises than he is able to give it.\n\nDr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">Brown</a>, in his essay on the Characteristics, observes, that the earl of Shaftesbury hath in that performance mingled beauties and blots, faults and excellencies, with a liberal and unsparing hand. At the same time, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> applauds that generous spirit of freedom which shines throughout the whole. Another direct antagonist of the earl of Shaftesbury, Dr Lealand, has observed, that no impartial man will deny him the praise of a fine genius. \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the writer (continues the doctor), his lively and beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, the delicacy of taste he hath shown in many instances, and the graces and embellishments of his style, though perhaps sometimes too affected, have procured him many admirers. To which may be added his refined sentiments on the beauty and excellency of virtue, and that he hath often spoken honourably of a just and good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a>, which ministers and governs the whole in the best manner; and hath strongly affected, in opposition to Mr Hobbes, the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between good and evil; and that man was originally formed for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of mutual kindness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>; and not only so, but for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> too. These things have very much prejudiced many persons in his favour, and prepared them for receiving, almost implicitly, whatever he hath advanced.\" Dr Johnson, as we are informed by Sir John Hawkins, bore no good-will to Lord Shaftesbury; neither did he seem at all to relish the cant of the Shaftesburian school, nor inclined to admit the pretensions of those who professed it, to tastes and perceptions which are not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to all men; a taste in morals, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> and prose writing, in painting, in sculpture, in music, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>! A taste that censured every production, and induced them to reprobate every effort of genius that fell short of their own capricious standard.\n\nThe grand point in which our noble author has rendered himself justly obnoxious to the friends of religion, is his having interspersed through the Characteristics a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of insinuations that appear to be unfavourable to the cause of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a>. There have not however been wanting many among his admirers, who have thought that he ought not to be reckoned among the deistical writers. The author of animadversions upon Dr Brown's three Essays on the Characteristics, observes, that it is \"imprudent, to say no worse, in some sincere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> for Christianity, to reject the friendly advice and affluence of so matterly a writer as the lord Shaftesbury, and to give him up to the Deists as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDELITY\">infidelity</a>.\" But it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of fact, and not considerations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> or imprudence, that must determine the question. In support of his lordship's having been a believer in our holy religion, may be alleged, his Preface to Whichcot's Sermons, and his Letters to a Student at the university: in both which works he constantly expresses himself in such language as seems to indicate that he was really a Christian. And with regard to the letters, it may be remarked, that they were written in 1707, 1708, and 1709, not many years before his lordship's death. Nevertheless, there are in the Characteristics to many sceptical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>, that he must be considered as having been a doubter at least, if not an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> unbeliever, with respect to revelation. But if he must be ranked among the Deists, we agree with the observation of one of his biographers; that he is a very different Deist from numbers who have appeared in that character; his general principles being much less exceptionable.\n\nThe style of Lord Shaftesbury's compositions is also a point upon which various and contradictory sentiments\nments have been entertained. But for the fullest and most judicious criticism that has appeared upon that subject, we may refer the reader to Dr Blair's Lectures on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">Rhetoric</a> and Belles Lettres, vol. i. p. 192, 193, 207, 208, 234, 263, and 396\u2014398.\n\nCooper, Samuel, a very eminent English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINIATURE\">miniature</a> painter, born in 1609, and bred under the care of his uncle John Hopkins. He derived, however, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> excellence from a study of the works of Van Dyck, in whose time he lived; inasmuch that he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> styled \"Vandyck in little.\" His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> was chiefly confined to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, in which, with all its dependencies, especially the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, he was inimitable; but if he descended lower his incorrectness was notorious. He died in 1672; and his pieces are universally admired all over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, selling for incredible prices.\u2014He had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, Alexander, likewise a good miniature painter, who became limner to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTINA\">Christina</a> queen of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>.\n\nCooper, Thomas, a pious and learned prelate in the reign of Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> about the year 1517. He was educated in the school adjoining to Magdalene <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, of which he was a chorister, where also, in 1539, he was elected probationer, and fellow in the following year. About the year 1546, quitting his fellowship, he applied himself to the study of physic, in 1556 took the degree of bachelor in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>, and practised as physician at Oxford. Being inclined to the Protestant religion, probably this was only a prudent fulfiling of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> intentions during the popish reign of Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>; for, on the accession of Elizabeth, he resumed the study of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>, became a celebrated preacher, was made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAN\">dean</a> of Christ-church, and vice-chancellor of the university, having accumulated the degrees of bachelor and doctor in divinity. In 1569 he was made dean of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLOUCESTER\">Gloucester</a>; and, the year following, bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a>: whence, in 1584, he was translated to the see of Winchester, in which city he died on the 29th of April 1594, and was buried in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> there, on the south side of the choir. The several writers who have mentioned Dr Cooper, unanimously give him the character of an eloquent preacher, a learned divine, and a good man. He had the misfortune, while at Oxford, to marry a lady whose gallantries became notorious: nevertheless he would not be divorced from her; knowing that he could not live without a wife, he did not choose to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> with the scandal of a second marriage.\"\u2014He wrote, 1. The Epitome of Chronicles from the 17th year after Christ to 1540, and thence after to 1560. 2. Thesaurus linguae Romanae et Britannicae. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DICTIONARY\">dictionary</a>, which is an improvement upon Elyot's, was much admired by Queen Elizabeth, who thenceforward determined to promote the author. 3. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> exposition of such chapters of the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a> as usually are read in the church, at common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a>, on Sundays throughout the year. 4. An admonition to the people of England. 5. Sermons.\n\nCooper, John Gilbert, a polite writer of the present age, was born in 1723; and was descended from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> family in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTTINGHAM\">Nottingham</a>, whose fortune was injured in the last century by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>. He resided at Thurgarton priory in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTTINGHAMSHIRE\">Nottinghamshire</a>, which was granted by King Henry VIII. to William Cooper, one of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>. This mansion Mr Cooper inherited from his father, who in 1639 was high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a> of the county; and transmitted it to his son, who filled the same respectable office in 1783. After passing through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> school under Dr John Nicoll, along with the late Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBEMARLE\">Albemarle</a>, Lord Buckinghamshire, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> Johnson, Mr George Ashby, and many other eminent and ingenious men, he became in 1743 a fellow-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONER\">commoner</a> of Trinity-college, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, and resided there two or three years; but quitted the university on his marriage with Sufanna the daughter of William Wright, Esq.; son to the lord keeper of that name, and recorder of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEICESTER\">Leicester</a> 1729\u20141763. In the year 1745 he commenced author by the publication of The Power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">Harmony</a>, a poem in 4to; and in 1746 and 1747 he produced several Essays and Poems under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIGNATURE\">signature</a> of Philalethes, in a periodical work called The Museion, published by Mr Dodley. In the same year he came forward as an author, with his name, by a work which received much assistance from his friend the Reverend John Jackson of Leicester, who communicated several learned notes, in which he contrived to manifest his dislike to his formidable antagonist Mr Warburton. It was entitled The Life of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a>, collected from the Memorabilia of Xenophon, and the Dialogues of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>, and illustrated farther by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, Diodorus Siculus, Cicero, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCLUS\">Proclus</a>, Apuleius, Maximus Tyrius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOETHIUS\">Boethius</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOGENES\">Diogenes</a> Laertius, Aulus Gellius, and others, 1749, 8vo. In this work Mr Cooper gave evident marks of superior genius; warm, impetuous, and impatient of restraint. In 1754, Mr Cooper published his Letters on Taste, 8vo; an elegant little volume, on which no small share of his reputation is founded; and in 1755, The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">Tomb</a> of Shakespeare, a Vision, 4to; a decent performance, but in which there is more of wit and application than of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> or genius. In 1756 he assisted Mr Moore, by writing some numbers of the World; and attempted to rouse the indignation of his countrymen against the Hessians, at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a> brought over to defend the nation, in a poem called the Genius of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, addressed to Mr Pitt. In 1758, he published Epistles to the Great, from Arisippus in Retirement, 4to; and The Call of Arisippus, Epistle IV. to Mark Akenside, M.D. Also, A Father's Advice to his son, in 4to. In the Annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">Register</a> of the same year is his Translation of an Epistle from the King of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a> to Monseigneur Voltaire. In 1759, he published Ver Vert; or the Nunnery Parrot; an Heroic Poem, in four cantos, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> to the Abbots of D***; translated from the French of Monsieur Gresset, 4to; reprinted in the first volume of Dilly's Repository, 1777; and, in 1764, Poems on several subjects, by the Author of the Life of Socrates; with a prefatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVERTISEMENT\">Advertisement</a> by Mr Dodley. In this little volume were included all the separate poetical pieces which have been already mentioned, excepting Ver Vert, which is a sprightly composition.

See Copernicus.\n\nCopernicus, Nicolaus, an eminent astronomer, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THORN\">Thorn</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a>, Jan. 10, 1472. He was taught the Latin and Greek languages at home; and afterwards sent to Cracovia, where he studied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> and physic. His genius in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> was naturally turned to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, which he pursued through all its various branches. He set out for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> when he was 23 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>; but staid at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a> some time, for the sake of being with the celebrated astronomer of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, Dominicus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARIA\">Maria</a>: whose conversation, however, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>, he affected, not so much as a learner, as an assistant to him in making his observations. From thence he passed to Rome, where he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> sooner arrived than he was considered as not inferior to the famous Regiomontanus; and acquired, in short, so great a reputation, that he was chosen professor of mathematics, which he taught for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time with great applause. He also made\nCopernicus made some astronomical observations there about the year 1500. Returning to his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> some years after, he began to apply his vast knowledge in mathematics to correct the system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a> which then prevailed. He set himself to collect all the books which had been written by philosophers and astronomers, and to examine all the various hypotheses they had invented for the solution of the celestial phenomena; to try <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> a more symmetrical order and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the parts of the world could not be discovered, and a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> and exquisite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> in its motions established, than what the astronomers of those times so easily admitted. But of all their hypotheses none pleased him so well as the Pythagorean, which made the sun to be the centre of the system, and supposed the earth to move not only round the sun, but round its own axis also. He thought he discerned much beautiful order and proportion in this; and that all that embarrassment and perplexity from epicycles and eccentricities, which attended the Ptolemaic hypothesis, would here be entirely removed.\n\nThis system, then, he began to consider, and to write upon, when he was about 35 years of age. He employed himself in contemplating the phenomena carefully; in making mathematical calculations; in examining the observations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, and in making new ones of his own; and after more than 20 years chiefly spent in this manner, he brought his scheme to perfection, and established that system of the world which goes by his name, and is now universally received, (see Astronomy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>). His system, however, was then looked upon as a most dangerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a>; for which he was thrown into prison by Pope Urban VIII. and not suffered to come out till he had recanted his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>; that is, till he had renounced the testimony of his senses. He died the 24th of May 1543, in the 70th year of his age.\n\nThis extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> had been made canon of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">Worms</a> by his mother's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, Lucas Wazebrodius, who was bishop of that place. He was not only the greatest of astronomers, but a perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the Greek and Latin tongues; to all which he joined the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and innocence of manners.\n\nThe following is the account of the discoveries of Copernicus by Dr Smith, in his Essays on Philosophical Subjects.\n\n\"The confusion (says Dr Smith) in which the old hypotheses represented the heavenly bodies, was, as Copernicus himself tells us, what first suggested to him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of forming a new system, that these, the noblest works of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, might no longer appear devoid of that harmony and proportion which discover themselves in her meanest productions. What most of all dissatisfied him was, the notion of the equalizing circle, which, by representing the revolutions of the celestial spheres as equable only when surveyed from a point that was different from their centres, introduced a real inequality into their motions; contrary to that most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a>, and indeed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> idea, with which all the authors of astronomical systems, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>, Eudoxus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIPPARCHUS\">Hipparchus</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a> themselves, had hitherto set out, that the real motions of such beautiful and divine objects must necessarily be perfectly regular, and go on, in a manner as agreeable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> as the objects themselves are to the senses. He began to con-\n\nVol. VI. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">Part</a> II.\nCopernicus, midnight, they appear nearest the earth, are largest, and most sensible to the eye, and seem to revolve backwards in their retrograde <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. To explain these appearances, the system of Ptolemy supposed each of these planets to be at the upper part of their several epicycles in the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, and at the lower in the other. But it afforded no satisfactory principle of connection, which could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> the mind easily to conceive how the epicycles of those planets, whose spheres were so distant from the sphere of the sun, should thus, if one may say so, keep time to its motion. The system of Copernicus afforded this easily; and like a more simple machine, without the assistance of epicycles, connected together, by fewer movements, the complex appearances of the heavens. When the superior planets appear nearly in conjunction with the sun, they are then in the side of their orbits, which is almost opposite to, and most distant from, the earth, and therefore appear smallest and least sensible to the eye. But as they then revolve in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> which is almost contrary to that of the earth, they appear to advance forward with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> velocity; as a ship that sails in a contrary direction to another, appears from that other to fail both with its own velocity and the velocity of that from which it is seen. On the contrary, when those planets are in opposition to the sun, they are on the same side of the sun with the earth, are nearest it, most sensible to the eye, and revolve in the same direction with it; but as their revolutions round the sun are slower than that of the earth, they necessarily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> behind by it, and therefore seem to revolve backwards; as a ship which sails slower than another, though it sails in the same direction, appears from that other to fail backwards. After the same manner, by the same annual revolution of the earth, he connected together the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> and retrograde motions of the two inferior planets, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a> appearances of all the five.\n\nThus far did this new account of things render the appearances of the heavens more completely coherent than had been done by any of the former systems. It did this, too, by a more simple and intelligible, as well as more beautiful machinery. It represented the sun, the great enlightener of the universe, whose body was alone larger than all the planets taken together, as established immovable in the centre, shedding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> on all the worlds that circulated around him in one uniform direction, but in longer or shorter periods, according to their different distances. It took away the diurnal revolution of the firmament, whole rapidity, upon the old hypothesis, was beyond what even thought could conceive. It not only delivered the imagination from the embarrassment of epicycles, but from the difficulty of conceiving these two opposite motions going on at the same time, which the system of Ptolemy and Aristotle bestowed upon all the planets; I mean, their diurnal westward, and periodical eastward revolutions. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH_S\">earth's</a> revolution round its own axis took away the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> for supposing the first, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> was easily conceived when by itself. The five planets, which seem, upon all other systems, to be objects of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> by themselves, unlike to every thing to which the imagination has been accustomed, when supposed to revolve along with the earth round the sun, were naturally apprehended to be objects of the same kind with the earth, habitable, opaque, and enlightened only by the rays of the sun. And thus this hypothesis, by classing them in the same species of things, with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> that is of all others the most familiar to us, took off that wonder and uncertainty which the strangeness and singularity of their appearance had excited; and thus far, too, better answered the great end of philosophy.\n\nNeither did the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and simplicity of this system alone recommend it to the imagination; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> and unexpectedness of that view of nature which it opened to the fancy, excited more wonder and surprise than the strangeness of those appearances, which it had been invented to render natural and familiar, and these sentiments still more endeared it. For though it is the end of philosophy to allay that wonder which either the unusual or seemingly disjointed appearances of nature excite, yet it never triumphs so much as when, in order to connect together a few, in themselves perhaps inconsiderable objects, the has, if I may say so, created another constitution of things, more natural indeed, and such as the imagination can more easily attend to, but more new, more contrary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> opinion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a>, than any of those appearances themselves. As in the influence before us, in order to connect together some seeming irregularities in the motions of the planets, the most inconsiderable objects in the heavens, and of which the greater part of mankind have no occasion to take any notice during the whole course of their lives, she has, to talk in the hyperbolic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TYCHO_BRAHE\">Tycho Brahe</a>, moved the earth from its foundations, sloped the revolution of the firmament, made the sun stand still, and subverted the whole order of the universe.\n\nSuch were the advantages of this new hypothesis, as they appeared to its author when he first invented it. But though that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a>, so natural to the learned, and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> which they are so apt to take in exciting, by the novelty of their supposed discoveries, the amazement of mankind, may notwithstanding what one of his disciples tells us to the contrary, have had its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> in prompting Copernicus to adopt this system; yet when he had completed his Treatise of Revolutions, and began coolly to consider what a strange doctrine he was about to offer to the world, he so much dreaded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> of mankind against it, that, by a species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINENCE\">continence</a> of all others the most difficult to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, he detained it in his closet for thirty years together. At last, in the extremity of old age, he allowed it to be extorted from him, but died as soon as it was printed, and before it was published.\n\nCopernicus, the name of an astronomical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, invented by Mr Whitton, to exhibit the motion and phenomena of the planets, both primary and secondary. It is built upon the Copernican system, and for that reason called by his name.","sp":276,"ep":278},{"h":"COPHTI","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPTS\">COPTS</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> COPTI, a name given to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, who are of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> of Jacobites.\n\nThe critics are extremely divided about the origin and orthography of the word; some write it Cophi, others Cophites, Cophites, Copts, &c. Scaliger derives the name from Coptos, an anciently celebrated town of Egypt, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> of the Thebaid. Kircher refutes this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, and maintains, that the word originally signifies \"cut\" and \"circumscribed;\" and\nwas given these people by the Mahometans, by way of reproach, because of their practice of circumcision: but P. Sollier, another Jesuit, refutes this opinion. Scaliger afterwards changed his opinion, and derived the word from \u0391\u03bd\u03c5\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> name of Egypt, by retrenching the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYLLABLE\">syllable</a>: but this opinion, too, P. Sollier disputes. John de Leo and others say, that the Egyptians anciently called their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> Elcbibth, or Cibth, from Cibth their first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, whence Coptite, &c. others say from Cobtim <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> king of Egypt. Vanleb derives the word Copt from Copt, son of Misfrain, grandson of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOAH\">Noah</a>. All these etymologies P. Sollier rejects, on this principle, that were they true, the Egyptians ought all equally to be called Cophi; whereas, in effect, none but the Christians, and among those none but the Jacobites, bear the name, the Melchites not being comprehended under it. Hence he chooses to derive the word from the name Jacobite, retrenching the first syllable; whence Cobite, Cobea, Copta, and Copta.\n\nThe Copts have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a> who resides at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a>, but he takes his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>; he has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> under him, but 11 or 12 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>. The rest of the clergy, whether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> or regular, is composed of the orders of St Anthony, St Paul, and St Macarius, who have each their monasteries. Besides the orders of priests, deacons, and subdeacons, the Copts have likewise archimandrites, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> whereof they confer with all the prayers and ceremonies of a strict ordination. This makes a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> among the priests; and besides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and authority it gives them with regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a>, it comprehends the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> and functions of archpriests. By a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of 600 years standing, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> elected bishop be not already archimandrite, that dignity must be conferred on him before episcopal ordination. The second person among the clergy, after the patriarch, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TITULAR\">titular</a> patriarch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, who also resides at Cairo, because of the few Copts at Jerusalem; he is, in effect, little more than the bishop of Cairo: only he goes to Jerusalem every Easter, and visits some other places in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a> near Egypt, which own his jurisdiction. To him belongs the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the Coptic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, during the vacancy of the patriarchal see.\n\nTo be elected patriarch, it is necessary the person have lived all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINENCE\">continence</a>; it is he confers the bishoprics. To be elected bishop, the person must be in the celibate; or, if he has been married, it must not be above once. The priests and inferior ministers are allowed to be married before ordination; but are not obliged to it, as Ludolphus erroneously observes. They have a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of deacons, and even confer the dignity frequently on children. None but the lowest rank among the people commence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a>; whence arises that excessive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> found among them; yet the respect of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAITY\">laity</a> towards the clergy is very extraordinary. Their office is longer than the Roman office, and never changes in anything: they have three liturgies, which they vary occasionally.\n\nThe monastic life is in great esteem among the Copts: to be admitted into it, there is always required the consent of the bishop. The religious Copts make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOW\">vow</a> of perpetual chastity; renounce the world, and live with great austerity in deserts: they are obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> in their clothes and their girdle, on a mat stretched on the ground; and to prostrate themselves every evening 150 times, with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> on the ground. They are all, both men and women, of the lowest class of the people; and live on alms. The nunneries are properly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>; and few enter but widows reduced to beggary.\n\nF. Roderic reduces the errors and opinions of the Copts to the following heads: 1. That they put away their wives, and espouse others while the first are living. 2. That they have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> sacraments, viz. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a>, the eucharist, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a>, ordination, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, fasting, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a>. 3. That they deny the Holy Spirit to proceed from the Son. 4. That they only allow of three ecumenical councils; that of Nice, Constantinople, and Ephesus. 5. That they only allow of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, and operation, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ, after the union of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>. For their errors in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>, they may be reduced, 1. To the practice of circumcising their children before baptism, which has obtained among them from the 12th century. 2. To their ordaining deacons at five years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. 3. To their allowing of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> in the second degree. 4. To their forbearing to eat blood; to which some add their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of a baptism by fire, which they confer by applying a hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> to their forehead or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a>. \u2014Others palliate these errors, and show that many of them are rather abuses of particular persons than doctrines of the feet. This seems to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with regard to their polygamy, eating of blood, marrying in the second degree, and the baptism of fire; for circumcision, it is not practised as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, nor as of any divine appointment, but merely as a custom which they derive from the Ishmaelites; and which, perhaps, may have had its origin from a view to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> and decency in those hot countries.\n\nThe Copts, at different times, have made several reunions with the Latins; but always in appearance only, and under some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of their affairs. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of Pope Paul IV. a Syrian was dispatched to Rome from the patriarch of Alexandria, with letters to that pope; wherein he acknowledged his authority, and promised obedience; desiring a person might be dispatched to Alexandria, to treat about a reunion of his church to that of Rome; pursuant to which, Pius IV., successor to Paul, chose F. Roderic, a Jesuit, whom he dispatched in 1561, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of apostolical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUNCIO\">nuncio</a>. But the Jesuit, upon a conference with two Copts deputed for that purpose by the patriarch, was made to know, that the titles of father of fathers, pastor of pastors, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of all churches, which the patriarch had bestowed on the pope in his letters, were no more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> matters of civility and compliment; and that it was in this manner the patriarch used to write to his friends: they added, that since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHALCEDON\">Chalcedon</a>, and the establishment of several patriarchs independent of one another, each was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> and master of his own church. This was the answer the patriarch gave the pope, after he had received a sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> remitted to him from Rome, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the Venetian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a>.","sp":278,"ep":279},{"h":"COPHTIC","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Coptic, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPTS\">Copts</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> language of the Egyptians, mixed with...\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPHIC\">COPHIC</a> a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of Greek, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> it is written in being all Greek.

Kircher is the first who published a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a> and vocabulary of the Coptic. There is not known any book extant in the Coptic, except translations of the Holy Scriptures, or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> offices; or others that have relation thereto, as dictionaries, &c.\n\nThe ancient Coptic is now no longer found but in books; the language now used throughout the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> is Arabic. The old Coptic, which Kircher maintains to be a mother tongue, and independent of all others, had been much altered by the Greeks: for besides that it has borrowed all its characters from the Greek, with a very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a>, a great number of the words are pure Greek. Vossius, indeed, affirms, that there was no Coptic language till after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> became subject to the Arabs. The language, according to him, is a mixture of Greek and Arabic: the very name thereof not being in the world till after the Arabs were masters of the country. But this, M. Simon observes, proves nothing; except that what was anciently called Egyptian, has since by the Arabs been called Coptic, by a corruption of speech. There are, it is true, Arabic words in the Coptic; yet this by no means proves but that there was a language before that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, either Coptic or Egyptian. Pietro de la Valle observes, that the Copts have entirely lost their ancient tongue; that it is now no longer understood among them; that they have nothing extant therein but some sacred books; and that they still say <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> in it.\n\nAll their other books have been translated into Arabic, which is their vulgar tongue; and this has occasioned the originals to be lost: it is added, that they rehearse the epistles and gospels in the mass twice; once in Arabic and once in Coptic.

Under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of Roman artists their thongs of leather would naturally be laid aside, and the junci, or rushes of the plains, worked up into cordage.

In the year 755, Abdoullahman, only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> of the Omnidid line, having passed over from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of a few desperate followers, found means to raise a rebellion in Spain; when, after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> fought on the banks of the Guadalquivir, in which he overthrew the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> of the Abbasid caliph of Damascus, he became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of all the Moorish possessions in the south of Spain, and in 759 fixed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> residence at Cordova. Then began those flourishing ages of Arabian gallantry and magnificence which rendered the Moors of Spain superior to all their contemporaries in arts and arms, and made Cordova one of the most splendid cities of the world. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> prospered under the happy sway of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a>; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> was changed from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of desolation, which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> wars and harsh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the viceroys had brought on, into a most populous flourishing state, exceeding in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, number of inhabitants, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>, and industry, any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> or subsequent era of the Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>. He added new fortifications to the town, built himself a magnificent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> with delicious gardens, laid causeways through the marshes, made excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> to open ready <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> between the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, and in 786 began the great mosque, which he did not live to finish.\n\nDuring the course of two centuries, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> of all professors of the polite arts, and of such as valued themselves upon their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> and knightly accomplishments; whilst the rest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> was buried in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, debased by brutality of manners, or distracted by superstitious disputes. England, weakened by its heptarchy, was too inconsiderable even to be mentioned in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> history of the times. France, though it had a gleam of reputation under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLEMAGNE\">Charlemagne</a>, was still a barbarous unpolished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> was in utter confusion; the frequent revolutions and change of masters rendering it impossible for learning, or any thing good to acquire a permanent footing in so unstable a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, though still in possession of the arts and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> of ancient Rome, had lost all vigour, and seemed absorbed in the most futile of all pursuits, viz. that of scholastic argument and religious subtleties.\n\nThe residence of the Omnidid caliphs was long conspicuous for its supreme magnificence, and the crowds of learned men who were allured to it by the protection offered by its sovereigns, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of the country, the wholesomeness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, and the variety of pleasures that returned incessantly in one enchanting round.\n\nCordova became the centre of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a>, industry, and genius. Tilts and tournaments, with other costly shows, were long the darling pastimes of a wealthy happy people; and this was the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> in the west where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, and physic were regularly studied and practised. Music was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less honoured; for we find, that in 844 a famous musician called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALI\">Ali</a> Zerib came to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> at Cordova, and formed several pupils, who were supposed to equal the most celebrated performers that were ever known even in the East. That <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> was greatly encouraged, we need no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> than the great and expensive fabrics undertaken and completed by many of these Spanish monarchs. Whatever faults may be justly condemned in their manner by the connoisseur, accustomed to the chastest noble graces of the Grecian proportions, certainly nobody can behold what remains of these Moorish edifices, without being strongly impressed with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> idea of the genius of the artists, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> who carried their plans into execution.\n\nThese sultans not only gave the most distinguished protection to arts and sciences, and to the persons learned in any of them, but were themselves eminently versed in various branches of knowledge. Alkahem II. collected so immense a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a> that before the end of his reign the royal library contained no less than 600,000 volumes, of which the very catalogue filled 40 huge folios. The university of Cordova was founded by him, and under such favourable auspices rose to the highest pitch of celebrity.\n\nAbdoullahman was succeeded by his son Hifsem, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> and architecture was not in the least inferior to that of his father. He put the finishing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> to the mosque, which the plunder of the southern provinces of France enabled him to complete in the course of a few years. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> over the Guadalquivir was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of Hifsem's after his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>.\n\nAlkahem succeeded Hifsem.\n\nAbdoullahman II. was also passionately fond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>. He was the first that brought the supplies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> to Cordova by means of leaden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> laid upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-AQUEDUCTS\">aqueducts</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>. The quantity was so considerable, that every part of the palace, the mosques, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a>, squares, and public edifices, had all of them their fountains constantly playing. A great many of these works still subsist. He paved the whole city, and erected several mosques.\n\nAfter him reigned Mahomet Almundar, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABDALLAH\">Abdallah</a>, and Abdoullahman III., who surpassed all his predecessors in splendor, riches, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>. His subjects vied with each other in profusion and magnificence. This monarch was succeeded by his son Alkahem II., who left a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> to succeed him, and the kingdom to be governed by the famous vizir Mahomet Abenamir, sur-\nCOR\n\nnamed Almanzor, or \"the defender,\" from his great victories and wise conduct. His descendants inherited from him the visirship, and a power as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they had been caliphs, until the weakness of the sovereigns encouraged, and the influence of the ministers provoked, the grandees to disturb the state with their jealousies and dissensions. These broils occasioned such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a>, as overthrew the throne of Cordova, and destroyed the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of Abdoulrahman. Thus the glorious edifice, founded by the valour and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> of that conqueror, and cemented by similar virtues in many of his successors, sunk into nothing as soon as the sceptre devolved upon weak enervated princes, whose indolence and incapacity transferred the management of every thing to a visir. Many petty kingdoms sprung up out of the ruins of this mighty empire; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> soon found opportunities of destroying, by separate attacks, that tremendous power, which when united had proved an overmatch for their utmost force.\n\nNew Cordoba, a considerable town of South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TUCUMAN\">Tucuman</a>, with a bishop's see, 175 miles from St Jago.

Grolier relates an observation concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of Corea, which, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, furnishes a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the revolutions which the surface of our globe has undergone. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Chinese book affirms, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> where Kipe, the king of Corea, established his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, was built in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> which forms at present a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the territories of Yong-ping-fou, a city of the first class in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Petcheli. \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> this (says he) be admitted as a fact, we may from thence conclude, that these territories formerly belonged to Corea; and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> of Lea-tong, which at present separates this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> from the province of Petcheli, did not then exist, and that it has been formed since; for it is not probable that the sovereign would have fixed his residence without the boundaries of his kingdom, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> in a place where he was separated from it by a wide and extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. This conjecture is confirmed by certain facts admitted by the Chinese. Thus when Yu, named the Great, undertook to drain and carry off the waters which had inundated the low grounds of several provinces, he began by the river Hoang-ho, the overflowing of which caused the greatest devastation. He went in search of its source to the bottom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a>, from whence he directed its course across the provinces of Chen-fu, Chen-fu, Honan, and Petcheli. Towards its mouth, in order to weaken the rapidity of its waters, he divided them into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> channels, through which he caused the river discharge itself into the eastern sea near the mountain of Kie-che-chan, which then formed a promontory. Since that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to the present, that is, about 3050 years, the river Hoang-ho has departed so much from its ancient course, that its mouth at present is about six degrees farther south. We must also remark, that the mountain Kie-che-chan, which was formerly united to the main <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> of Yong-ping-fou, stands at present in the sea at the distance of about 50 leagues to the south of that city. If the sea has been able to cover with its waters that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of territory which at present forms part of the gulf of Lea-tong, may we not be allowed to suppose that like inundations may have formed successively the whole of that gulf, the ancient existence of which seems so ill to agree with the residence of the kings of Corea in the territories of Yong-ping-fou? It is true, the Chinese history makes no mention of so considerable a physical revolution: but it is equally futile with regard to the 500 ly (50 leagues) extent of ground which is at present covered by the sea beyond the mountains of Kie-che-chan. Besides, of all the changes which the surface of our globe experiences, those only\nare mentioned in history which happen suddenly, and which consequently make more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on the minds of men.\n\nCorea chiefly produces wheat, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>, and ginfeng, with a kind of palm tree which yields a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> capable of producing a yellow varnish little inferior to gilding. Hence also are exported castor and sable skins; also gold, silver, iron, and fossil salt; a kind of small brushes for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>, made of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLF\">wolf</a>'s tail, are likewise manufactured here, which are exported to China and highly esteemed there. The sea coasts abound in fish, and great numbers of whales are found there every year towards the north-east. Several of these, it is said, have in their bodies the harpoons of the French and Dutch, from whom they have escaped in the northern extremities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>; which seems to indicate a passage from the European into the Asiatic seas round the continents of Europe and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>.\n\nA considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of the paper of Corea is annually imported into China; indeed the tribute due to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> is partly paid with it every year. It is made of cotton, and is as strong as cloth, being written upon with a small hair-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a>; but must be done over with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> before it can be written upon in the European manner. It is not purchased by the Chinese for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, but for filling up the squares of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAN\">fan</a>-windows; because, when oiled, it resists the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> better than that of China. It is used likewise as wrapping paper; and is serviceable to the tailors, who rub it between their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> until it becomes as soft and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> as the finest cotton cloth, instead of which it is often employed in lining clothes. It has also this singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, that if it be too thick for the purpose intended, it may be easily split into two or three leaves, each of which is even stronger than the best paper of China.\n\nThe Coreans are well made, ingenious, brave, and tractable; are fond of dancing; and show great docility in acquiring the sciences, to which they apply with great ardour, and which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> in a particular manner. The northern Coreans are larger sized and more robust than those of the south; have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for arms, and become excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>.

He entertained an early propensity for the violin; and as he advanced in years, laboured incessantly in the practice of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>. About the year 1672, his curiosity led him to visit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, probably with a view to attend the improvements which were making in music under the influence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Mazarine, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the establishment of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> academy; but notwithstanding the character which he brought with him, he was driven back to Rome by Lully, whose jealous temper could not brook so formidable a rival as this illustrious Italian. In the year 1680 he visited Germany, and met with a reception suitable to his merit from most of the German princes, particularly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELECTOR\">elector</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAVARIA\">Bavaria</a>; in whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> he was retained, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. After about five years stay abroad, he returned again to Rome, and there pursued his studies with great assiduity.\n\nThe proficiency of Corelli on his favourite instrument the violin was so great, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of it spread throughout <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. The style of his performance was learned, elegant, and pathetic; and his tone firm and even. Mr Geminiani, who was well acquainted with, and had studied it, used to resemble it to a sweet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRUMPET\">trumpet</a>. A person who had heard him perform says, that, whilst he was playing on the violin, it was usual for his countenance to be disturbed, his eyes to become as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> as fire, and his eye-balls to roll as in an agony.\n\nCorelli was highly favoured by that great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> and music, Cardinal Ottoboni. Crespelini says, that he regulated the musical academy held at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of his eminence every Monday afternoon. Here it was that Mr Handel became acquainted with him; and in this academy a serenata of Mr Handel, entitled \"Il Trionfo del Tempo,\" was performed, the overture to which was in a style so new and singular, that Corelli was confounded in his first attempt to play it.\n\nDuring the residence of Corelli at Rome, besides those of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, many persons were ambitious of becoming his disciples, and learning the practice of the violin from the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> on that instrument the world had then heard of. Of these it is said the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Edgecumbe was one; and that the fine mezzotinto print of Corelli by Smith was scraped from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> painted by Mr Hugh Howard at Rome for that nobleman.\n\nCorelli died at Rome in 1713; and was buried in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of the Rotunda, otherwise called the Pantheon.\nCorelli, in the first chapel on the left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of the entrance. Over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERMENT\">interment</a> is a sepulchral monument to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>, with a marble bust thereon, erected at the expense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> William, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> palatine of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a>, under the care and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of Cardinal Ottoboni.\n\nFor many years after his decease, this excellent musician was commemorated by a solemn musical performance in the Pantheon, on the anniversary of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. In the year 1730 an eminent master, now living, was present at that solemnity, who relates that at the third and eighth of his concertos were performed by a numerous band, among whom were many who had been the pupils of the author. He adds, that these two pieces were performed in a slow, distinct, and firm manner, without graces, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as they are wrote; and from hence concludes, that this was the manner in which they were played by the author himself.\n\nHe died possessed of about 600l. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>. He was a passionate admirer of pictures, and lived in an uninterrupted friendship with Carlo Cignani and Carlo Marat; these two eminent painters were rivals for his favour; and for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of years presented him at times with pictures, as well of other masters as of their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>. The consequence was, that Corelli became possessed of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and valuable collection of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> paintings; all which, together with the sum above-mentioned, he bequeathed to his dear friend and patron Cardinal Ottoboni, who reserving the pictures to himself, generously distributed the rest of his effects among the relations of the testator.\n\nCorelli is said to have been remarkable for the mildness of his temper and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> of his deportment; nevertheless, he was not infensible of the respect due to his skill and exquisite performance. Cibber, in the Apology for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">Life</a>, p. 340, relates, that when he was playing a solo at Cardinal Ottoboni's, he discovered the cardinal and another person engaged in discourse, upon which he laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> his instrument; and being asked the reason, gave for answer, that he feared the music interrupted their conversation.\n\nThe compositions of Corelli are celebrated for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> resulting from the union of all the parts; but the fineness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIRS\">airs</a> is another distinguishing characteristic of them: the allegro in the 10th solo is as remarkable for spirit and force, as that in the 11th is for its enchanting delicacy: his jigs are in a style peculiarly his own: and that in the 5th solo was never equalled. In the gavot movements in the 2d and 4th operas, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELODY\">melody</a> is distributed with great judgment among the several parts. In his minuets alone he seems to fail; Bononcini, Mr Handel, and Giuseppe Martini, have excelled him in this kind of airs.\n\nIt is said there is in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> a style both in speaking and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, which never becomes obsolete; a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of phraseology, so consonant and congenial to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> and principles of its respective <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, as to remain settled and unaltered. This, but with much greater latitude, may be said of music; and accordingly it may be observed of the compositions of Corelli, not only that they are equally intelligible to the learned and unlearned, but that the impressions made by them have been found to be as durable in general. His music is the language of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; and, for a series of years, all that heard it became sensible of its effects: of this there cannot be a stronger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> than that, amidst all the innovations which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of change had introduced, it continued to be performed, and was heard with delight, in churches, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRES\">theatres</a>, at public solemnities, and festivities, in all the cities of Europe for near 40 years. Men remembered, and would refer to pallia in it as to a classic author; and even at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, the masters of the science do not hesitate to pronounce of the compositions of Corelli, that, of fine harmony and elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODULATION\">modulation</a>, they are the most perfect exemplars.","sp":287,"ep":288},{"h":"COREOPSIS","t":"TICKSEED SUNFLOWER: A genus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> belonging to the syngenesia clas; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> method ranking under the 49th order, Compositae.

It belongs at present to the Venetians; and forms the bulwark of Christendom against the Turks, who have often attempted to reduce it, but without success. It is well fortified, and has 50 castles; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the inhabitants is said to be about 53,000.

It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, strongly fortified, and defended by a garrison of about 10,000 men; which, however, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of a late traveller, do not appear adequate to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the fortifications. A number of very excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> cannon are mounted on the different forts, which, he observes, are so divided, that it would take treble the number of their garrison to defend them. However, the republic of Venice is generally at peace with the different European nations, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> power of the Turks being much decayed, they have little to apprehend; though to prevent any sudden surprise, the Venetians keep a formidable squadron in the harbour of Corfu, and the works have been much improved by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> General Paterion.\u2014In the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> they had with the Turks, this town was attacked by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of 80,000 men, and attempted to be stormed several times by the enemy; but the garrison, which consisted of 12,000 men, under the command of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Schulenburg, made so brave and gallant a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, that they always repulsed them, and obliged them to raise the siege, and abandon the place with considerable loss. For this piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> the republic has caused a magnificent statue to be erected in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of the count, with an elegant Latin inscription, setting forth the many eminent services of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> achievements. The circumference of the city is about four miles; the number of inhabitants\ninhabitants on the whole island is computed at about 50,000, the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of whom are Greeks.\n\nThis island is the residence of the governor general, whose jurisdiction extends over all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> subject to the republic of Venice, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVANT\">Levant</a> seas, and is considered as one of the greatest honours they can confer on a subject. He is always a nobleman of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, and has his appointment for three years only, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he makes a tolerable addition to his fortune, and on his return to Venice is generally advanced to the honours of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>. In the city are many handsome Greek churches, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> of which is that of St Speridione, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a>. It is embellished with some excellent paintings, and most superbly ornamented. The body of the saint from whom it was named, is preserved entire in a rich shrine within the church. The Greeks are most of them such fanatics as to be continually offering their devotions at this shrine, believing that through the intercession of the saint they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> obtain all their wants; and that by offerings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> their sins will be forgiven them; by which means the church has amassed an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a>.

It is said to have been founded 1514 years before Christ, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SISYPHUS\">Sisyphus</a> the son of Molus, and grandfather of Ulysses. Various reasons are given for its name, but most authors derive it from Corinthus the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PELEUS\">Peleus</a>. It was situated on the south <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the isthmus which joins the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PELOPONNESUS\">Peloponnesus</a>, now the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOREA\">Morea</a>, to the continent. It consisted of a citadel built upon an eminence, and thence named Acrocorinthus; besides which it had two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> subjacent to it, named Lechium and Cenchrea. The whole state extended scarce half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> in length <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> breadth; but so advantageously were the above-mentioned ports situated, that they might have gained the Corinthians a superiority, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not a command, over all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, had not their advantageous situation inclined them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> rather than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>. For their citadel was almost impregnable; and commanding both the Ionian and Aegean seas, they could easily cut off all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> from one half of Greece with the other; for which reason this city was called one of the fetters of Greece.\n\nBut as the genius of the Corinthians led them to commerce rather than martial exploits, their city became the finest in all Greece. It was adorned with the most sumptuous buildings, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>, palaces, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRES\">theatres</a>, porticoes, &c. all of them enriched with a beautiful kind of columns, which from the city were called Corinthian. But though the Corinthians seldom or never engaged in a war with a view of enlarging but rather of defending their little state, they did not forget to cultivate a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> both in time of peace and of war. Hence many brave and experienced generals have been furnished by Corinth to the other Grecian cities, and it was not uncommon for the latter to prefer a Corinthian general to any of their own.\n\nThis city <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to preserve its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> till the year before Christ 146, when it was pillaged and burnt by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>. It was at that time the strongest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the world; but the inhabitants were so disheartened by a preceding defeat, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of their general, that they had not presence of mind enough even to shut their gates. The Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a> Mummius, was so much surprised at this, that at first he could scarce believe it; but afterwards fearing an ambuscade, he advanced with all possible caution. As he met with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> resistance, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> had nothing to do but destroy\nCorinth. destroy the few inhabitants that had not fled, and plunder the city. Such of the men as had staid were all put to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, and the women were sold for slaves. After this the city was ravaged by the greedy soldiers, and the spoils of it are said to have been immense. There were more vessels of all sorts of metal, more fine pictures and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> done by the greatest masters, in Corinth, than in any other city in the world. All the princes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> who had any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a> furnished themselves here with their richest moveables: here were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> the finest statues for temples and palaces, and all the liberal arts brought to their greatest perfection. Many ineffable pieces of the most famous painters and statuaries fell into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the ignorant soldiers, who either destroyed them, or parted with them for a trifle. Polybius the historian was an eye witness to this barbarism of the Romans. He had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> to see two of them playing at dice on a famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of Ariadne, which was accounted one of the wonders of the world. The piece was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACCHUS\">Bacchus</a>, so exquisitely done, that it was proverbially said of any extraordinary performance, \"It is as well done as the Bacchus of Ariadne.\" This masterly piece of painting, however, the soldiers willingly exchanged for a more convenient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> to play upon; but when the spoils of Corinth were put up to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>, Attalus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERGAMUS\">Pergamus</a> offered for it 600,000 sesterces, near 500l. of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>. Mummius was surprised at such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> price offered for a picture, and imagined there must be some magical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> in it. He therefore interposed his authority, and carried it to Rome, notwithstanding the complaints of Attalus. Here this famous picture was lodged in the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CERES\">Ceres</a>, where it was at last destroyed by fire, together with the temple. Another extraordinary instance of the stupidity of Mummius is, that when the pictures were put on board the transports, he told the masters of the vessels very seriously, that if any of the things were either lost or spoiled, he would oblige them to find others at their own cost; as if any other pieces could have supplied the loss of those ineffable originals, done by the greatest masters in Greece. When the city was thoroughly pillaged, fire was let to all the corners of it at the same time. The flames grew more violent as they drew near the centre, and at last uniting there made one prodigious conflagration. At this time the famous metallic mixture is said to have been made, which could never afterwards be imitated by art. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, silver, and bronzes, which the Corinthians had concealed, were melted, and ran <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the streets in streams, and when the flames were extinguished, a new metal was found, composed of several different ones, and greatly esteemed in after ages.\n\nThe town lay desolate until Julius Caesar settled there a Roman colony; when, in moving the rubbish and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a>, many vases were found of bronzes or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> finely embossed. The price given for these curiosities excited industry in the new inhabitants. They left no burying-place unexamined; and Rome, it is said, was filled with the furniture of the sepulchres of Corinth.\n\nStrabo was at Corinth soon after its restoration by the Romans. He describes the site as follows, \"A lofty mountain, in perpendicular height as much as Corinth, three stadia and a half (near half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>), the ascent 30 stadia (3\u00bd miles), ends in a pointed summit called Acrocorinthus. Of this the portion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> is the most steep: beneath which lies the city on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> at the foot of the Acrocorinthus. The circuit of the city alone has been 40 stadia (5 miles), and as much of it as was unhindered by the mountain has been walled about. Within the inclosure was comprehended also the Acrocorinthus, where the mountain was capable of receiving a wall; and as we ascended, the vestiges were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>; so that the whole circumference exceeded 8\u00bd stadia (near 11 miles). On the other sides, the mountain is less steep, but rises very high, and is visible all around. Upon the summit is a small temple of Venus; and below it the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> Pirene, which does not overflow, but is always full of pellucid and potable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. They say it unites with some other hidden veins, and forms the spring at the mountain foot, running into the city, and affording a sufficient supply for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the inhabitants. In the city is plenty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELLS\">wells</a>, and in the Acrocorinthus, as they say, for we did not see any. There they relate the winged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> Pegasus was taken as he was drinking, by Bellerophon. Below Pirene is the Siphneum, some temple or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, the remains not inconsiderable. From the summit is beheld to the north <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARNASSUS\">Parnassus</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELICON\">Helicon</a>, lofty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> covered with snow; and below both, to the west, the Cretan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> bounded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHOCIS\">Phocis</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOEOTIA\">Boeotia</a> and the Megaris, and by Corinthia and Sicyonia opposite to Phocis. Beyond all these are the mountains called the Oneian, stretching as far as Boeotia and Citheron from the Scironian rocks on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTICA\">Attica</a>.\" Strabo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> likewise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLEON\">Cleon</a> from thence. Cenchrea was then a village. Lechaeum had some inhabitants.\n\nNew Corinth had flourished 217 years when it was visited by Paeanias. It had then a few antiquities, many temples and statues, especially about the Agora or market-place, and several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HADRIAN\">Hadrian</a> introduced water from a famous spring at Stymphalus in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCADIA\">Arcadia</a>; and it had various fountains alike copious and ornamental. The stream of one issued from a dolphin, on which was a brazen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEPTUNE\">Neptune</a>; of another, from the hoof of Pegasus, on whom Bellerophon was mounted. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, coming along the road leading from the marketplace toward Sicyon, was the Odeum and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>, by which was a temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a>. The old Gymnasium was at a distance. Going from the marketplace toward Lechaeum was a gate, on which were placed Paeston and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">Sun</a> in gilded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARIOTS\">chariots</a>. Pirene entered a fountain of white marble, from which the current passed in an open channel. They supposed the metal called Corinthian bronzes to have been immersed while <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> hot in this water. On the way up to the Acrocorinthus were temples, statues, and altars; and the gate next Tenea, a village with a temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a>, sixty stadia, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> miles and a half distant, on the road to Mycenae. At Lechaeum was a temple and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRONZE\">bronze</a> image of Neptune. At Cenchrea were temples; and by the way from the city a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROVE\">grove</a> of cypress trees, sepulchres, and monuments. Opposite was the Bath of Helen, water tepid and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, flowing plentifully from a rock into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. Mummius had ruined\nCorinth, and the munificence of the great Athenian Atticus Herodes was displayed in an edifice with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> inferior to few of the most celebrated structures in Greece.\n\nThe Roman colony was reserved to suffer the same calamity as the Greek city, and from a conqueror more terrible than Mummius, Alaric the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> destroyer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> Greece. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> harassed with frequent wars, as the Peloponnesus has since been, the Acrocorinthus was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> too consequential to be neglected. It was besieged and taken in 1459 by Mahomet II.; the despots or lords of the Morea, brothers of the Greek emperor who was killed in defending Constantinople, refusing payment of the arrears of the tribute, which had been imposed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SULTAN\">Sultan</a> Morat in 1447. The country became subject to the Turks, except such maritime places as were in the possession of the Venetians; and many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> inhabitants were carried away to Constantinople. Corinth, with the Morea was yielded to the republic at the conclusion of the war in 1698, and again by it to the Turks in 1715.\n\nCorinth retains its old name, and is of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, standing on a high ground, beneath the Acrocorinthus, with an easy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> toward the gulf of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEPANTO\">Lepanto</a>; the houses scattered or in parcels, except in the Bazar or market-place. Cypresses, among which tower the domes of mosques, with corn-fields, and gardens of lemon and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a> trees, are interspersed. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is reputed bad in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, and in autumn exceedingly unhealthy. Wheler relates, that from the top of the Acrocorinthus or citadel, he enjoyed one of the most agreeable prospects which this world can afford. He guessed the walls to be about two miles in compass, including mosques, with houses and churches mostly in ruins. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> was consumed in going up on horseback. It was a mile to the foot of the hill; and from thence the way was very steep with many traverses. The families living below were much infested by corsairs, and on every alarm flocked up to the castle.\n\nAccording to Dr Chandler, Corinth has preserved but few monuments of its Greek or Roman citizens. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> remains, he informs us, are at the southwest corner of the town, and above the bazar or market; 11 columns supporting their architraves, of the Doric order, fluted, and wanting in height near half the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> proportion to the diameter. Within them, toward the western end, is one taller, though not entire, which, it is likely, contributed to sustain the roof. They have been found to be stone, not marble; and appear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>, perhaps from a crust formed on the outside. The ruin he judges to be of very remote antiquity, and a portion of a fabric erected not only before the Greek city was destroyed, but before the Doric order had attained to maturity. He suspects it to have been the Siphneum mentioned by Strabo. North of the Bazar stands a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of brickwork, a remnant, it may be conjectured, of a bath, or of the Gymnasium.\n\nThe inhabitants are most of them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> of the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, who are allowed liberty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> by the Turks.

Julius Caesar, Caligula, and Nero, attempted to cut a channel through it, but in vain; and they therefore afterwards built a wall across it, which they called Hexamilium, because it was six miles in length. This was demolished by Amurath II., and afterwards rebuilt by the Venetians, but was levelled a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time by Mahomet II.","sp":289,"ep":291},{"h":"CORINTHA","t":"a Grecian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>, celebrated for her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and poetic talents, was born at Theissu, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOEOTIA\">Boeotia</a>, and was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Myrtis another Grecian lady.

When the tree is 15 years old, it may be barked for eight years successively; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the bark improves with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of the tree. When stripped from the tree, which does not therefore die, the bark is piled up in a pond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> ditch, and loaded with heavy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> to flatten it, and reduce it into tables: hence it is removed to be dried; and when sufficiently dry, put in bales for carriage. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> care be not taken to strip the bark\nCork bark, it splits and peels off itself; being pushed up by another bark formed underneath.\n\nThe cork-tree, as well as the uses to which the bark is applied, was known both to the Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>. Pliny informs us that the Romans employed it to stop all kinds of vessels; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of it for this purpose does not appear to have been very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of glass bottles, of which, according to Professor Beckman, there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> mention before the 15th century.\n\nOther vegetable productions have been sometimes employed instead of cork. The *Spondias Lutea*, a tree which grows in South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, particularly in moist places, and which is there called *mombin* or *mombra\u00edn*, is sometimes brought to England for the purpose of stopping vessels. The roots of liquorice are applied to the same use, and on that account, this plant is much cultivated in Scyria, and exported to other countries. A tree called *nyssa*, which grows in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> America, has been found also to answer as a substitute for cork.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> use of cork is, to put in shoes, slippers, &c., and to stop bottles. The Spaniards burn it to make that kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> called *Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>*, which is used by painters. The Egyptians made coffins of cork; which being lined with a resinous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, preserved dead bodies uncorrupted. The Spaniards line <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> walls with it, which not only renders them very warm, but corrects the moisture of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>.\n\n*Fossil Cork*, a name given to a kind of stone which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of amianthus, consisting of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> fibres loosely interwoven, and somewhat resembling vegetable cork. It is the lightest of all stones; by fire it is fusible, and forms a black glass. It possesses the general qualities of amianthus. See that article.\n\n**Cork**, in Latin *comitatus Corcaegiensis*, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUNSTER\">Munster</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>. It is the most populous and considerable county of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> next to that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>, containing near a million of acres, and being divided into 15 baronies. It is bounded on the north-east by the county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATERFORD\">Waterford</a>; on the west by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KERRY\">Kerry</a>; by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMERICK\">Limerick</a> on the north; and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> on the south and south-east. Including Desmond it is 85 miles in length and 50 in breadth; but is very unequal both ways. Though a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> is foggy, mountainous, and barren, yet by the industry of the inhabitants it is pretty well cultivated and improved, and contains several good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>.\n\n**Cork**, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Ireland, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of the county of that name. It is an episcopal see, and is the largest and most populous of any in the kingdom, Dublin alone excepted. It is situated on the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEE\">Lee</a>, 15 miles from its mouth. It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of great trade, the harbour here being one of the finest in the world. Though smaller vessels can come up to the quay, yet the larger generally ride at a place called Passage. This city, together with its liberties, makes a county. It was built or rather fortified by the Danes, in the ninth century. The greatest part of it stands on a marshy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> surrounded by the river Lee, which also runs through the city, and divides it into several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>. On this account some have thought the air very moist and unwholesome. Complaints have also been made against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> as impure; but, from comparing the bills of mortality with those of other cities, it appears that the city of Cork is far from being unhealthy. This hath been accounted for from the influx of the tide, by which a stagnation of air is prevented. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a> of Cork was bestowed by Henry III. and afterwards ratified by Edward I., Edward II., and Edward III. Edward IV. granted a new charter; and the city received many favours from the succeeding monarchs. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> James I. gave the citizens a new and ample charter; and King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I. what is called the Great Charter, by which, among others, a clause in King James's charter was enforced, making this city a county of itself. The fee of Cork is reputed worth 2700l. a-year. The charter consists of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAN\">dean</a>, chanter, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a>, archdeacon, and twelve prebendaries. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> is dedicated to St Barr or Finbarr; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a> is divided into five deaneries. There is very little to be found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> writers concerning the foundation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> of Cork; yet it is generally ascribed to St Barr in the seventh century. Many of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> have been great benefactors to it. Through length of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the church became quite ruinous; but it hath lately been completely rebuilt, and is now an elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> structure. To defray the expense, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> laid a tax on all coals consumed in the city of Cork. The deanery is reputed to be worth 400l. a-year.\n\nCork is much improved and enlarged, several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> streets have been lately added, by filling up the canals that formerly ran through them, and are now built up with elegant houses: the parade is very spacious, and is adorned with an equestrian statue of King George II. It hath the largest export in the kingdom, particularly of beef, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIDES\">hides</a>, tallow, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, fish, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>. It is partly situated on several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, formed by the river Lee, which are banked and quayed in, somewhat like the towns in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>; and partly on rising grounds, on the north and south sides of the river. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARLBOROUGH\">Marlborough</a> besieged and took it from King James's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> in 1690; when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Grafton, who served as a volunteer, was slain in the attack. It contains about 8600 houses, and upwards of 70,000 inhabitants. It hath twelve companies of foot quartered in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRACKS\">barracks</a>. Besides a stately cathedral, built from the foundation, between 1725 and 1735, by the produce of a duty upon coals, as above noticed, it is adorned with several handsome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> churches. It has also an elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, a new and beautiful customhouse, a town-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a>, several fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>, and various other public structures. The city possesses an annual revenue of about 1300l. out of which the mayor enjoys for his salary and the support of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> 500l. The wealth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> of Cork arise from its capacious and commodious haven, where almost any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of ships may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> with ease and safety. According to some accounts, when there has been no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, 1200 vessels have resorted hither in a year. Ships from England, bound to all parts of the West Indies, take in here a great part of their provisions; and on the same account the haven of Cork is visited by those also of most other nations. The slaughtering season continues from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of August to the latter end of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a>; in which space it has been computed, that they\nthey kill and cure seldom fewer than 100,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of black cattle. The rest of their exports consists of butts of tallow, candles, hides raw and tanned, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> cloth, pork, calves, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMBS\">lambs</a>, and rabbit skins, tallow, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> for England, linen and woollen yarn, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-WORSTED\">worsted</a>. The merchants of Cork carry on a very extensive trade to almost all parts of the known world; so that their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> is annually increasing. The produce of the customs some years since exceeded 62,000l. and the number of ships that they employ is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> to what it was forty years ago. The only thing that seemed to be wanting to the security of the port of Cork was supplied in the earl of Chesterfield's memorable administration, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> a fort on the great island, to command the entrance of the haven. The outlets of Cork are cheerful and pleasant. The country around the city, on both sides of the river, is hilly and picturesque; and the harbour called the Cove, is one of the best in the world; the entrance is safe, and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a> of England might ride in it, secure from every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> that blows. Ships of burden, however, are obliged to unload at Passage, five miles and a half from Cork, the channel not admitting vessels of above 150 tons.\n\nCork Jacket or Waistcoat, is an invention of one Mr Dubourg, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> very fond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a>, but subject to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRAMP\">cramp</a>, which led him to consider of some method by which he might enjoy his favourite diversion with safety. The waistcoat is composed of four pieces of cork, two for the breasts and two for the back; each pretty near in length and breadth to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of a waistcoat without flaps; the whole is covered with coarse canvass, with two holes to put the arms through; there is a space left between the two back-pieces, and the same betwixt each back and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>-piece, that they may fit the easier to the body. Thus the waistcoat is only open before, and may be fastened on the wearer with strings; or, if it should be thought more secure, with buckles and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> straps. This waistcoat does not weigh above 12 ounces, and may be made up for about five or six shillings' expense. Mr Dubourg tried his waistcoat in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a>, and found that it not only supported him on the water, but that two men could not sink him, though they used their utmost efforts for that purpose. If those who use the sea occasionally, and especially those who are obliged to be almost constantly there, were to have these waistcoats, it would be next to impossible that they should be drowned. It would also be of vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to those that, for the sake of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, bathe in the sea; and even the most delicate and timorous young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> might by the help of one of these jackets venture into a rough sea.

After the celebration of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> mass, the procession, consisting of the several tradesmen of the town, begins.

The companies are followed by music; and after the musicians, the friars in the habits of their order, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> priests, and then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABBOT\">abbot</a> magnificently adorned, and preceded by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOST\">host</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">Machines</a> likewise of various fantastic forms and devices, and as variously accoutred, form a part of the show on this occasion; which is described as one of the most superb and magnificent in the world, by an eye-witness, in 1735.\n\nCormorant, a corruption of corvorant.

Other countries have maize and rice in lieu of it; and some parts of America, both in the islands and continents, simple roots, such as potatoes and mimiac.\u2014Egypt was anciently the most fertile of all other countries in corn; as appears both from sacred and profane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>. It furnished a good part of the people subject to the Roman empire, and was called the dry nurse of Rome and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, France, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a>, seem now in the place of Egypt, and with their superfluities support a good part of Europe.\n\nFor the first discovery and culture of corn, authors are much divided; the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> is, that in the first ages men lived on the spontaneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; as acorns, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> or malt produced by the beech; which, they say, took its name fagus, from the Greek \u03c6\u03ac\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, I eat. It is added, that they had not either the use of corn, or the art of preparing or making it eatable.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CERES\">Ceres</a> has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> of being the first that showed the use of corn, on which account she was placed among the gods; others gave the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to Triptolemus; others share it between the two, making Ceres the first discoverer, and Triptolemus the first planter and cultivator of corn. Diodorus Siculus affirms the whole to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISIS\">Isis</a>; on which Polydore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a> observes, he does not differ from the self; Isis and Ceres being in reality the same. The Athenians pretend it was among them the art began; and the Cretans, or Cadians, Sicilians, and Egyptians, lay claim to the same. Some think the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of the Sicilians best supported, that being the country of Ceres; and authors add, she did not teach the secret to the Athenians, till she had first instructed her own countrymen. Others say, Ceres passed first into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTICA\">Attica</a>, thence into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRETE\">Crete</a>, and, last of all, into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>; many of the learned, however, maintain it was in Egypt the art of cultivating corn first began; and it is certain there was corn in Egypt and the East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before the time of Ceres.\n\nCorn is very different from fruits, with respect to the manner of its preservation; and is capable of being preserved in public granaries, for pressing occasions, and of being kept for several centuries.\u2014A little time after the siege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METZ\">Metz</a>, under Henry II. of France, in the year 1578, the duc d'Esperon laid up vast stores of corn in the citadel; which was preserved in good plight to the year 1707, when the\nFrench king and his retinue, passing that way, ate bread baked thereof.\n\nThe chief thing that contributes to the preservation of corn is a crust which forms on its surface, by the germination of the grain next underneath, to the thickness of an inch and a half. On that at Metz people walked, without its giving the least way. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEDAN\">Sedan</a> was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANARY\">granary</a> cut in a rock, wherein a heap of corn was preserved a hundred and ten years: it was covered with a crust a foot thick.\n\nFor the preservation of corn, the first method is to let it remain in the spile; the only expedient for conveying it to the islands and provinces of America. The inhabitants of those countries <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> it in the ear, and raise it to maturity by that precaution; but this method of preserving it is attended with several inconveniences among us; corn is apt to rot or sprout, if any of the least moisture is in the heap; the rats likewise infect it, and our want of straw also obliges us to separate the grain from the ear. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> is to turn out and winnow it frequently; or to pour it through a trough or mill-hopper, from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> to another; being thus moved and aired every fifteen days, for the first six months, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> require less labour for the future, if lodged in a dry place; but if, through neglect, mites should be allowed to slide into the heap, they will soon reduce the corn to a heap of dust: this must be avoided by moving the corn anew, and rubbing the places adjacent with oils and herbs, whose strong odour may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a> them away; for which garlic and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DWARF\">dwarf</a>-elder are very effectual; they may likewise be exposed to the open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, which immediately kills them. When the corn has been preserved from all impurities for the space of two years, and has exhaled all its fires, it may be kept for so or even one hundred years, by lodging it in pits covered with strong planks closely joined together; but the safer way is to cover the heap with quicklime, which should be dissolved by sprinkling it over with a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of water; this causes the grains to shoot to the depth of two or three fingers; and incloses them with an incrustation, as above mentioned, through which neither air nor insects can penetrate.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> Corn, or Maize.

Many cures have been prescribed, but the total removal of them is always found to be attended with great difficulty. It has been recommended to soften them with plasters, and then to pull them up by the roots, to apply caustic, &c., but the best cure is to bathe them frequently in warm water, and pare away as much as possible of the indurated skin without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> blood.\n\nCornage, an ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENURE\">tenure</a>, the service whereof was to blow a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">horn</a> when any invasion of the Scots Cornarists was perceived.

He maintained that every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a> needed reformation; but he added, that no person had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to engage in accomplishing it without a million supported by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a>.

His preceptor made him change his name of Haguenbot to that of Cornarius, under which he is most known. At twenty years of age he taught <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a>, and explained the Greek and Latin poets and orators to his scholars; and at twenty-three was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LICENTIATE\">licentiate</a> in medicine. He found fault with most of the remedies provided by the apothecaries; and observing, that the greatest part of the physicians taught their pupils only what is to be found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AVICENNA\">Avicenna</a>, Rhazes, and the other Arabian physicians, he carefully sought for the writings of the best physicians of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, and employed about fifteen years in translating them into Latin, especially the works of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a>, Aetius, Eginetus, and a part of those of Galen. Meanwhile he practised physic with reputation at Zwickow, Frankfort, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARBURG\">Marburg</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NORDHAUSEN\">Nordhausen</a>, and Jena, where he died of an apoplexy in 1558, aged fifty-eight. He also wrote some medicinal treatises; published editions of some poems of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> on medicine and botany; and translated some of the works of the fathers, particularly those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASIL\">Basil</a>, and a part of those of Epiphanius.\n\nCornaro, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEWIS\">Lewis</a>, a Venetian of noble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a>, memorable for having lived healthful and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> to above one hundred years of age by a rigid course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a>. By the ill conduct of some of his relations he was deprived of the dignity of a noble Venetian; and seeing himself excluded from all employments under the republic, he settled at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PADUA\">Padua</a>. In his youth he was of a weak <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>; and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> reduced himself at about forty years of age to the brink of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>, under a complication of disorders; at which extremity he was told that he had no other chance for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, but by becoming sober and temperate. Being wise enough to adopt this wholesome counsel, he reduced himself to a regimen of which there are very few examples. He allowed himself no more than twelve ounces of food and fourteen ounces of liquor each day; which became habitual to him, that when he was above seventy years of age, the experiment of adding two ounces to each by the advice of his friends, had like to have proved fatal to him. At eighty-three he wrote a treatise which has been translated into English, and often printed, entitled, \"Sure and Certain Methods of attaining a Long and Healthful Life;\" in which he relates his own story, and extols temperance to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of enthusiasm. At length the yolk of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a> became sufficient...\nsufficient for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>, and sometimes for two, until he died with much ease and composure in 1666.

An affair of gallantry occasioned his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> his first piece, entitled Melite; which had prodigious success. Encouraged by the applause of the public, he wrote the Cid, and the other tragedies that have immortalized his name. In his dramatic works he discovers a majesty, a strength and elevation of genius, scarce to be found in any other of the French poets; and, like our immortal Shakespeare, seems better acquainted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> than with the rules of critics.

The natives are remarkable for their strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>, as well as their dexterity in wrestling, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> the Cornish hogs is highly extolled.\n\nThis county abounds in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of different metals and semimetals; but the principal produce is tin. The Phoenicians early visited these coasts for this article, some think 400 or 450 years before Christ; and the mines continued to be wrought with various success at different periods. In the time of King John they appear to have yielded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of working them being wholly in the king as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Cornwall, and the mines farmed by the Jews for 100 marks; and according to this proportion the 10th of it, 6l. 13s. 4d., is at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> paid by the crown to the bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXETER\">Exeter</a>. In the time of Richard king of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> and earl of Cornwall, the tin-mines were immensely rich; the Jews being farmed out to him by his brother Henry III., what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> they had was at his disposal. The Spanish tin-mines being slopped by the Moors, and none discovered in Germany, the Malabar coast, or the Spanish West Indies, Cornwall and its earls had all the trade of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> for it. The Jews being banished the kingdom, 18 Edw. I., they were again neglected till the gentlemen of Blackmore, lords of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> tithings best stored at that time with tin, obtained of Edmund earl of Cornwall, son of Richard king of the Romans, a charter under his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>, with more explicit grants of privileges, courts, pleas, parliaments, and the toll-tin or 1/10th of all the tin raised. At this time too the right of bounding or dividing tin-grounds into separate partitions for the encouragement of searching for it seems to have been first appointed, or at least adjusted. This charter was confirmed 33 Edward I., and the Cornish separated from the Devonshire tinners. Their laws, particularly recited in Plowden's Commentaries, p. 237, were further explained 50 Edw. III., confirmed and enlarged by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, 8 Rich. II., 3 Ed. IV., 1 Ed. VI., 1 and 2 P. and M., and 2 Eliz., and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> divided into four parts under one general warden to do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a>, from whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> lies an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to the duke of Cornwall in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, or for want of a duke of Cornwall to the crown. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a>-warden appoints a vice-warden to determine all flannery disputes every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>; he also constitutes four stewards, one for each of the precincts before mentioned, who hold their courts every three weeks, and decide by juries of six persons, with an appeal referred to the vice-warden, lord warden, and lord of the prince's council. In difficult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> the lord-warden, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>, issues his precept to the four principal towns of the flannery districts, who each choose six members; and these twenty-four flannators constitute the parliament of tinners. Each flannator chooses an assistant, making a kind of standing council in a different apartment to give information to the prince. Whatever is enacted by the body of tinners must be signed by the flannators, the lord-warden, or his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a>, and by the duke or the king, and thenceforward has with regard to tin affairs all the authority of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of the whole.\nwhole legislature. Five towns are appointed in the most convenient parts of the county for the tinniers to bring their tin to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of a year. These are Liskeard, Leftwitheil, Truro, Helston, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENZANCE\">Penzance</a>, the last added by Charles II. for the convenience of the western tinniers. In the time of Henry VIII., there were but two coines at Midsummer and Michaelmas; two more at Christmas and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a>-day were added, for which the tinniers pay an acknowledgment called Pq8 groats, or 4d. for every hundred of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> tin then coined. The officers appointed by the duke <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSAY\">assay</a> it; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> well purified stamp it by a hammer with the duchy seal, the arms of Richard earl of Cornwall, a lion rampant G. crowned O. within a bordure of bezants S; and this is a permission to the coiner to sell, and is called coining the tin. Every hundred of white tin so coined pays to the duke 4s. The tin of the whole county, which, in Carew's time, in the last century, amounted to 30,000l. or 40,000l. yearly, has for 24 years past amounted one year with another to 180,000l. or 190,000l. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>. Of this the duke of Cornwall receives for his 4s. duty on every hundred of white tin above 10,000l. yearly; the bounders or proprietors of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> about \u00bcth at a medium clear, or about 30,000l. yearly; the remainder goes to the adventurers in the mine, who are at all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of working. Tin is found collected and fixed in lodes and floors, or in grains and bunches in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> rock, or loofe and detached in single separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> called floes or freans, or in a continued course of such stones called the beubeyl or living stream, or in an arenaceous pulverized state. It is most easily discovered by tracing the lodes by the scattered fragments of them called floes, by leave of the lord of the soil or the bounder. The tin being divided among the lords and adventurers, is stamped and worked at the mill; and being thus dressed is carried under the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> tin to the melting-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, where it is melted by Welch pit-coal, and poured into blocks of 320lb. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, and carried to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COINAGE\">coinage</a> town. Mundic, a scarce metal or mineral ore, of a white, braffy, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, is found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> quantities, intermixed with tin, copper, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, and sometimes by itself. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">Iron</a> ore is found in Cornwall, but the working it does not answer. There is no richer copper, nor a greater variety anywhere than in this county. Silver, if really found here in the reigns of Edward I. and II., has been rarely found since, nor do the lead mines answer. Very late discoveries have proved that Cornwall has more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> than was formerly imagined. What is called the Cornish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a> is a figured crystal generally hexagonal and pyramidal, or columnar, or both, of a fine clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and of all our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASTARD\">bastard</a> diamonds in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> esteemed the best, and some of different colours, black, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, &c. The clearer these are, the better they will bear engraving for seals.\n\nIn privileges and language Cornwall seems to be another kingdom. By 21 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> it was ordered that all duty on Cornish cloth exported should be remitted to every Englishman within the duchy of Cornwall. This was first granted by the Black Prince, in consideration of their paying 4s. for the coinage of every hundred of tin; whereas Devonshire pays no more than 8d. They have also by grant from Richard earl of Cornwall, confirmed 25 Henry III., freedom to take land out of the sea and carry it through the Cornwall country for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a>; whereupon in the following reign, on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INQUISITION\">inquisition</a> made, we find a complaint that Saltash had lately taken 12s. yearly for each barge that carried sand up the Tamar; whereas nothing ought to have been demanded. They still continue this ancient method of improving their land, carrying it ten miles up into the country, and great part of the way on horses backs. Mr Ray supposes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of this sand depends chiefly on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> mixed with it, which is so copious that in many places salt is boiled up out of a lixivium made of the sea sand; and the reason why sand when it has lain long in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> proves less enriching and useful is, that the dews and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> evaporate great part of its salt. They had likewise a privilege of trading to all parts of the world, granted them by Charles I. in recompense of their loyalty.\n\nThe number of boroughs in this small county was surprisingly increased by Edward VI., who added seven to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> six, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> two, Elizabeth five, making in all 21, lending 40 members besides the county two. Eight of these boroughs had an immediate or remote connection with the demesne lands of the duchy; the rest belonged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> houses, or powerful families, or were old boroughs, which had legal immunities granted to them by their princes or lords.\n\nThe Cornish language is a dialect of that which till the Saxons came in was common to all Britain, and more anciently to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a>; but the inhabitants of this island being dispersed before those conquests, and driven into Wales and Cornwall, and thence into Bretagne, the same language, for want of frequent intercourse, became differently pronounced and written, and in different degrees mixed with different languages. Hence came the Welsh, the Cornish and the Armorican dialects, whose radicals are so much alike that they are known and admitted by the inhabitants of either country; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a> so varied that they cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a>. The Cornish is reckoned the most pleasing of the three. It was spoken so generally here <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the reign of Henry VIII. that Dr John Moreman, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VICAR\">vicar</a> of Mynhein, is said to have been the first who taught his parishioners the Lord's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a>, the creed, and ten commandments in English, and at the Reformation the natives desired the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> in English. The older people in some parishes retained their original language to the middle of the last century; and the last sermon was preached in it in 1678. When Mr Ray was here, 1662, he could find but one person who could write this language; and it is now so nearly extinct, that Mr Barrington, in 1768, could only find one old woman who could read in it, and she is since dead.\n\nCORODY.

It is bounded on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> by Golconda, on the east by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a>, on the south by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MADURA\">Madura</a>, and on the west by Bijnagar. This coast so much resembles that of Orixa, that the Abb\u00e9 Raynal chooses to consider them as one, and gives to both the general name of Coromandel. Here an excessive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> reigns from the beginning of May to the end of October. It begins at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, and continues till nine in the evening. During the night it is allayed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-breeze from the south-east; and most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> this refreshing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALE\">gale</a> begins at three in the afternoon. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is less inflamed during the rest of the year, though in all seasons it is very hot. It rains almost continually during the months of November and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>. This immense tract is covered with a parched <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of two miles, and sometimes only one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> along the coast.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> was at first neglected by the Europeans for many reasons. It was separated by inaccessible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> from Malabar, where these bold adventurers endeavoured to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> themselves. Spices and aromatics, which were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> objects of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, were not to be found there. In short, civil dissensions had banished from it tranquillity, fecundity, and industry. At that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> the empire of Bijnagar, to which this vast country was subject, was falling to ruin. The governors of Vilapour, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARNATIC\">Carnatic</a>, Golconda, and Orixa, threw off their dependence, and assumed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of kings. Those of Madura, Tanjore, Mylore, Gingi, and some others, likewise usurped the sovereign authority, though they retained their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> title of Naick. This revolution had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> happened when the Europeans appeared on the coast of Coromandel. The foreign trade was at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> inconsiderable; it consisted only of diamonds from Golconda, which were carried to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALICUT\">Calicut</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURAT\">Surat</a>, and from thence to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORMUS\">Ormus</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUEZ\">Suez</a>, whence they were circulated through all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> and Asia. Masulipatan, the richest and most populous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of these countries, was the only market that was known for linens; they were purchased at a great fair annually held there by the Arabian and Malayan vessels that frequented that bay, and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARAVANS\">caravans</a> arrived from distant parts. The linens were exported to the same places with the diamonds. The fondness for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> of Coromandel, which began to prevail here, inspired all the European nations trading to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> seas with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of forming settlements there. They were not discouraged either by the difficulty of conveying goods from the inland parts of the country, where there was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> navigable river; by the total want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>, where the sea at one season of the year is not navigable; by the barrenness of the coasts, for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> uncultivated and uninhabited; nor by the tyranny and fluctuating state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. They thought that silver would be industriously sought after; that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEGU\">Pegu</a> would furnish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, and Bengal corn for subsistence; that a prosperous voyage of nine months would be more than sufficient to complete their ladings; and that by fortifying themselves they should be secure against the attacks of the weak tyrants that oppressed these countries.\n\nThe first European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> were established near the shore. Some of them obtained a settlement by force; most of them were formed with the consent of the sovereigns; and all were confined to a very narrow tract of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>. The boundaries of each were marked out by a hedge of thorny <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, which was their only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time fortifications were raised; and the security derived from them, added to the lenity of the government, soon increased the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of colonists. The splendor and independence of these settlements several times raised the jealousy of the princes in whose dominions they were formed; but their attempts to demolish them proved abortive. Each colony increased in prosperity in proportion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> that founded it. None of the companies that exercised an exclusive privilege beyond the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good Hope had any concern in the trade of diamonds. This was always left to private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, and by degrees fell entirely into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the English, or the Jews and Armenians that lived under their protection. At present this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> and industry is much reduced. The revolutions that have happened in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> have prevented people from resorting to these rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a> in which this unhappy country is plunged leaves no room to hope that they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be again attended to. The whole of the commercial operations on the coast of Coromandel is confined to the purchase of cottons. The manufacturing of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> cotton brought there differs so little from ours, that it would be neither interesting nor instructive to enter into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of it. The process used in making their printed cottons, which was at first servilely followed in Europe, has since been rendered more simple, and brought to greater perfection by our manufacturers. The painted cottons which are brought there we have not yet attempted to imitate. Those who imagine we have been prevented from undertaking this branch merely by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> price of labour among us, are mistaken. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> has not given us the wild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> and drugs necessary for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of those bright and indelible colours which constitute the principal merit of the Indian manufactures; nor has she furnished us with the waters that serve to fix them. The Indians do not universally observe the same method in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> their cottons; either because there are some niceties peculiar to certain provinces, or because different soils produce different drugs for different uses. We should tire the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> of our readers were we to trace the flow...\nflow and painful progress of the Indians in the art of painting their cottons. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to believe that they owe it to length of time, rather than to the fertility of their genius. What seems to authorize this conjecture is, that they have stopped in their improvements, and have not advanced a single step in the arts for many ages; whereas we have proceeded with amazing rapidity. Indeed, were we to consider only the want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> in the Indians, we should be tempted to believe, that, from time immemorial, they have received the arts they cultivate from some more industrious nation; but when it is remembered that these arts have a peculiar dependence on the materials, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a>, colours, and productions of India, we cannot but be convinced that they are natives of that country. It may appear somewhat surprising that cottons painted with all sorts of colours should be sold at so moderate a price, that they are almost as cheap as those that have only two or three. But it must be observed, that the merchants of the country sell to all the companies a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of cottons at a time; and that the demand for cottons painted with various colours makes but a small article in their assortments, as they are not much esteemed in Europe.\n\nThough cottons of all sorts are in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> manufactured through the whole country of Indostan, which extends from Cape Comorin to the banks of the Ganges; it is observable, that the finest are made in the eastern part, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> ones in the centre, and the coarse ones in the most western parts. Manufactures are established in the European colonies, and upon the coast; they are more frequent at the distance of five or six leagues from the sea, where cotton is more cultivated, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> are cheaper. The purchases made there are carried 30 or 40 leagues farther into the country. The Indian merchants settled in the European factories have always the management of this business. The quantity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the goods wanted are settled with these people; the price is fixed according to the patterns; and at the time a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> is made, a third or fourth part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> agreed on is advanced. This arrangement is owing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> these merchants themselves are under of advancing money to the workmen by the partners or agents who are dispersed through the whole country; of keeping a watchful eye upon them, for fear of losing what they have advanced; and of gradually lessening the sum, by calling for the cottons as fast as they are worked off. Without these precautions, nothing could be depended on in an oppressive government, where the weaver cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> on his own account, either because his circumstances will not permit, or because he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DARES\">dares</a> not venture to discover them for fear of exactions. The companies that have either success or good management, constantly keep the stock of one year in advance in their settlements. By this method they are sure of having the quantity of goods they have occasion for, and of the quality they choose, at the most convenient time; not to mention that their workmen, and their merchants, who are kept in constant employment, never leave them. Such nations as want money and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> cannot begin their mercantile operations till the arrival of their ships. They have only five or six months at most to execute the orders sent from Europe. The goods are manufactured and examined in haste; and they are even obliged to take such as are known to be bad, and would be rejected at any other time. The necessity they are under of completing their cargoes, and fitting out their vessels before hurricanes come on, leaves no room for nicety of inspection. It would be a mistake to imagine that the country agents could be prevailed upon to order goods to be made on their account in hopes of selling them with a reasonable advantage to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with whom they are engaged. For, besides that the generality of them are not rich enough to embark in so large an undertaking, they would not be certain of finding their account in it. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the company that employ them should be hindered by unforeseen accidents from sending the usual number of ships, these merchants would have no vent for their commodities. The Indians, the form of whose dyes requires different breadths and lengths from those of the cottons fabricated for our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, would not purchase them; and the other European companies would be provided, or certain of being provided, with whatever the extent of their trade required, and their money enabled them to purchase. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of procuring loans, which was contrived to remedy this inconvenience, never has nor can be useful. It has been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, time immemorial, in Indostan, for every citizen who borrows money to give a written <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> to his creditor. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a> is of no force in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of judicature, unless it is signed by three witnesses, and bears the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> and the year when it was made, with the rate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> agreed upon by the parties. If the borrower fails to fulfil his engagements, he may be arrested by the lender himself. He is never imprisoned, because there is no fear of his making his escape. He would not even eat, without obtaining leave of his creditor. The Indians make a three-fold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of interest; one kind they call vice; another neither vice nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>; and a third, they say, is virtue. The first is four per cent. a month; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> two; and the third one. The last is, in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of beneficence that only belongs to the most heroic minds. Yet, though the Europeans, who are forced to borrow, meet with this treatment, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> they cannot avail themselves of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> without being involved in ruin.\n\nThe foreign trade of Coromandel is not in the hands of the natives. In the western part, indeed, there are Mohammedans known by the name of Chitias, who, at Naur and Porto-Nuovo, send out ships to Acehien, Merguy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIAM\">Siam</a>, and the eastern coast. Besides vessels of considerable burden employed in these voyages, they have smaller embarkations for the coaling trade for Ceylon and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEARL\">pearl</a>-fishery. The Indians of Malipatam turn their attention another way. They import from Bengal white calicoes, which they dye or print, and sell them again at the places from whence they had them, at 35 or 40 per cent. advantage. Excepting these transactions, which are of very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, the whole trade is vested in the Europeans, who have no partners but a few Banians and Armenians settled in their colonies. The quantity of calicoes exported from Coromandel to the different ports of India may be computed at 3500 bales. Of these the French carry 800 to Malabar, Mocha, and\nand the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of France; the English, 1200 to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-BOMBAY\">Bombay</a>, Malabar, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMATRA\">Sumatra</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIPPINE_ISLANDS\">Philippine <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>; and the Dutch 1500 to their different settlements. Except 500 bales destined for Manila, each of the value of 100 guineas, the others are of such an ordinary kind that they do not exceed 30 guineas at prime cost; so that the whole number of bales does not amount to more than about 150,000.\n\nCoromandel furnishes Europe with 9500 bales; 800 of which are brought by the Danes, 2500 by the French, 3000 by the English, and 3200 by the Dutch. A considerable part of these calicoes are dyed blue, or striped blue and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> for the African trade. The others are fine muslins, printed calicoes, and handkerchiefs from Maffulipatan, or Paliacate. It is proved by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> that each of these bales costs only about \u00a321 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>; consequently they ought to bring in to the manufactory where they are wrought near \u00a360,000. The payments are not entirely made in specie, either in Europe or Asia; we give in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a>, cloths, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, coral, and some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of less value. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, Asia pays with spices, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, corn, and dates. All these articles taken together may amount to about \u00a310,000; and from this calculation it follows, that Coromandel receives annually from Europe about \u00a3300,000 in money.

This officer is of equal authority with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a>; and was ordained, together with him to keep the peace, when the earls gave up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARDSHIP\">wardship</a> of the county.\n\nHe is chosen by all the freeholders of the county <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>; and by the statute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> I. it was enacted, that none but lawful and discreet knights should be chosen; but it seems now sufficient if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> have lands enough to be made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a>, whether he be really knighted or not; for the coroner ought to have an estate sufficient to maintain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of his office, and answer any fines that may be made upon him for his\nCORONER his misbehaviour; and if he hath not enough to answer, his fine shall be levied on the county, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> for electing an insufficient officer.

VII. c. 1. which Sir Edward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COKE\">Coke</a> complains of heavily, though since his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> those fees have been much enlarged.\n\nThe coroner is chosen for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; but may be removed, either by being made sheriff or chosen verderor, which are offices <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with the other; and by the statute 25 Geo. II. c. 29. extirpation, neglect, or misbehaviour, are also made causes of removal.\n\nThe office and power of a coroner are also, like those of the sheriff, either judicial or ministerial; but principally judicial. This is in great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> ascertained by statute 4 Edw. I. De officio coronatoris; and consists, first, in inquiring, when any person is slain, or dies suddenly, or in prison, concerning the manner of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. And this must be super vi et corpus; for if the body is not found, the coroner cannot fit. He must also fit at the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where the death happened. And his inquiry is made by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a> from four, five, or six, of the neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, over whom he is to preside. If any be found guilty by this inquest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a>, he is to commit to prison for farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, and is also to inquire concerning their lands, goods, and chattels, which are forfeited thereby; but whether it be murder or not, he must inquire whether any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a> of death has accrued to the king, or the lord of the franchise, by this death; and must certify the whole of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INQUISITION\">inquisition</a> to the court of king's bench, or the next assizes. Another branch of his office is to inquire concerning shipwrecks; and certify whether wreck or not, and who is in possession of the goods. Concerning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-TREASURE_TROVE\"><a class=\"xref</a>\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a>-trove, he is also to inquire concerning the finders, and where it is, and whether any one be suspected of having found and concealed a treasure; \"and that may well be perceived (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> the old statute of Edw.

And, when they are dispersed by death or otherwise, how shall they transfer these advantages to another set of students, equally unconnected as themselves?

Corporations aggregate consist of many persons united together into one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, and are kept up by a perpetual succession of members, so as to continue for ever: of which kind are the mayor and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONALTY\">commonalty</a> of a city, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> and fellows of a college, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAN\">dean</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>. Corporations sole consist of one person only and his successors, in some particular station, who are incorporated by law, in order to give them some legal capacities and advantages, particularly that of perpetuity, which in their natural persons they could not have had. In this sense the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> is a sole corporation; so is a bishop; so are some deans and prebendaries, distinct from their several chapters; and so is every parson and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VICAR\">vicar</a>. And the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, or at least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> will be very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>, if we consider the case of a parson of a church. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> endowment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>-churches, the freehold of the church, the church-yard, the parsonage-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, the glebe, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITHES\">tithes</a> of the parish, were vested in the then parson by the bounty of the donor, as a temporal recompense to him for his spiritual care of the inhabitants, and with intent that the same emoluments should ever afterwards continue as a recompense for the same care. But how was this to be effected? The freehold was vested in the parson; and, if we suppose it vested in his natural capacity, on his death it might descend to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a>, and would be liable to his debts and incumbrances: or at best, the heir might be compelled, at some trouble and expense, to convey these rights to the succeeding incumbent. The law therefore has wisely ordained, that the parson, quatenus parson, shall never die, any more than the king; by making him and his successors a corporation. By which means all the original rights of the parsonage are preserved entire to the successor; for the present incumbent, and his predecessor who lived <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> centuries ago, are in law one and the same person; and what was given to the one was given to the other also.\n\nAnother division of corporations, either sole or aggregate, is into ecclesiastical and lay. Ecclesiastical corporations are, where the members that compose it are entirely spiritual persons, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, certain deans and prebendaries, all archdeacons, parsons, and vicars, which are sole corporations; deans and chapters at present, and formerly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> and convent, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABBOT\">abbot</a> and monks, and the like, bodies aggregate. These are erected for the furtherance of religion; and perpetuating the rights of the church.\u2014Lay corporations are of two sorts, civil and eleemosynary. The civil are such as are erected for a variety of temporal purposes. The king, for instance, is made a corporation, to prevent in general the possibility of an interregnum or vacancy of the throne, and to preserve the possession of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> entire; for immediately upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMISE\">demise</a> of one king, his successor is in full possession of the regal rights and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>. Other lay corporations are erected for the good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of a town or particular district, as a mayor and commonality, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-BAILIFF\">bailiff</a> and burgesses, or the like: some for the advancement and regulation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> and commerce; as the trading companies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>; and some for the better carrying on of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> special purposes; as church wardens, for conservation of the goods of the parish; the college of physicians and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of surgeons in London, for the improvement of the medical science; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> society for the advancement of natural knowledge; and the society of antiquarians for promoting the study of antiquities. The eleemosynary sort are such as are constituted for the perpetual distribution of the free alms or bounty of the founder of them to such persons as he has directed. Of this kind are all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a> for the maintenance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, sick, and impotent; and all colleges, both in our universities and out of them: which colleges are founded for two pur-\nposes: 1. For the promotion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and learning by proper regulations and ordinances. 2. For imparting affluence to the members of those bodies, in order to enable them to prosecute their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a> and studies with greater ease and affluence. And all these eleemosynary corporations are, strictly speaking, lay, and not ecclesiastical, even though composed of ecclesiastical persons, and although they in some things partake of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, privileges, and restrictions of ecclesiastical bodies.\n\nHaving thus marshalled the several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of corporations, let us next proceed to consider, 1. How corporations in general may be created. 2. What are their powers, capacities, and incapacities. And, 3. How they may be dissolved.\n\nI. Corporations, by the civil law, seem to have been created by the mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> and voluntary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> of their members; provided such convention was not contrary to law, for then it was illicitum collegium. It does not appear that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>'s consent was necessary to be actually given to the foundation of them; but merely that the original founders of these voluntary and friendly societies (for they were little more than such) should not establish any meetings in opposition to the laws of the state.\n\nBut in England the king's consent is absolutely necessary to the erection of any corporation, either impliedly or expressly given. The king's implied consent is to be found in corporations which exist by force of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> law, to which our former kings are supposed to have given their concurrence; common law being nothing else but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, arising from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> agreement of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>. Of this sort are the king himself, all bishops, parsons, vicars, church-wardens, and some others; who by common law have ever been held (as far as our books can show us) to have been corporations, virtute officii; and this incorporation is so inseparably annexed to their offices, that we cannot frame a complete legal idea of any of these persons, but we must also have an idea of a corporation, capable to transmit his rights to his successors, at the same time. Another method of implication, whereby the king's consent is presumed, is as to all corporations by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESCRIPTION\">prescription</a>, such as the city of London, and many others, which have existed as corporations, time whereof the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> runneth out to the contrary; and therefore are looked upon in law to be well created. For though the members thereof can show no legal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a> of incorporation, yet in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> antiquity the law presumes there once was one; and that by the variety of accidents, which a length of time may produce, the charter is lost or destroyed. The methods by which the king's consent is expressly given, are either by act of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> or charter. By act of parliament, of which the royal assent is a necessary ingredient, corporations may undoubtedly be created: but it is observable, that most of those statutes which are usually cited as having created corporations, do either confirm such as have been before created by the king; as in the case of the college of physicians, erected by charter to Hen. VIII., which charter was afterwards confirmed in parliament: or, they permit the king to erect a corporation in futuro with such and such powers; as is the case of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of England, and the society of the British fishery. So that the immediate creative act is usually performed by the king alone, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of his royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a>.\n\nAll the other methods therefore whereby corporations exist, by common law, by prescription, and by act of parliament, are for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> reducible to this of the king's letters patent, or charter of incorporation. The king's creation may be performed by the words creamus, ergimus, fundamus, incorporamus, or the like. Nay it is held, that if the king grants to a set of men to have gildam mercatorium, \"a mercantile meeting or assembly,\" this is alone sufficient to incorporate and establish them for ever.\n\nThe king (it is said) may grant to a subject the power of erecting corporations, though the contrary was formerly held; that is, he may permit the subject to name the persons and powers of the corporation at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>; but it is really the king that erects, and the subject is but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>; for though none but the king can make a corporation, yet qui facit per alium, facit per se. In this manner the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> of the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> has power by charter to erect corporations; and has actually often exerted it in the erection of several matriculated companies, now subsisting, of tradesmen subservient to the students.\n\nWhen a corporation is erected, a name must be given to it; and by that name alone it must sue and be sued, and do all legal acts.\n\nII. After a corporation is so formed and named, it acquires many powers and rights, which we are next to consider. Some of these are necessarily and inseparably incident to every corporation; which incidents as soon as a corporation is duly erected, are tacitly annexed of course. As, 1. To have perpetual succession. This is the very end of its incorporation; for there cannot be a succession for ever without an incorporation; and therefore all aggregate corporations have a power necessarily implied of electing members in the room of such as go off. 2. To sue or be sued, implead or be impleaded, grant or receive, by its corporate name, and do all other acts as natural persons may. 3. To purchase lands and hold them, for the benefit of themselves and their successors: which two are consequential to the former. 4. To have a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>. For a corporation, being an invisible body, cannot manifest its intentions by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> act or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORAL\">oral</a> discourse: it otherwise acts and speaks only by its common seal. For though the particular members may express their private consents to any act by words or signing their names, yet this does not bind the corporation; it is the fixing of the seal, and that only, which unites the several assents of the individuals who compose the community, and makes one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> assent of the whole. 5. To make by-laws or private statutes for the better government of the corporation; which are binding upon themselves, unless contrary to the laws of the land, and then they are void. But no trading company is with us allowed to make by-laws which may affect the king's prerogative or the common profit of the people, under penalty of 40l. unless they be approved by the chancellor, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> justices, or the judges of assize in their circuits; and even though they be so approved, still, if contrary to law, they are void. These five powers are inseparably incident to every corporation, at least to every corporation\nCorporation aggregate; for two of them, though they may be practised, yet are very unnecessary to a corporation sole; viz. to have a corporate seal to testify his sole assent, and to make statutes for the regulation of his own conduct.\n\nCorporations have a capacity to purchase lands for themselves and successors; but they are excepted out of the statute of wills; so that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVISE\">devise</a> of lands to a corporation by will is good; except for charitable uses, by stat. 43. Eliz. c. 4, which exception is again greatly narrowed by the stat. 9. Geo. II. c. 36. And also, by a great variety of statutes, their privilege even of purchasing from any living grantor is much abridged; so that now a corporation, either ecclesiastical or lay, must have a license from the king to purchase, before they can exert that capacity which is vested in them by the common law: nor is even this in all cases sufficient. These statutes are generally called the Statutes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTMAIN\">mortmain</a>. See Mortmain.\n\nThe general duties of all bodies politic, considered in their corporate capacity, may, like those of natural persons, be reduced to this single one; that of acting up to the end or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, whatever it be, for which they were created by their founder.\n\nIII. How corporations may be dissolved. Any particular member may be disfranchised, or lose his place in the corporation, by acting contrary to the laws of the society, or the laws of the land; or he may resign it by his own voluntary act. But the body politic may also itself be dissolved in several ways; which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> is the civil death of the corporation; and in this case their lands and tenements shall revert to the person, or his heirs, who granted them to the corporation; for the law doth annex a condition to every such grant, that if the corporation be dissolved, the grantor shall have the lands again, because the cause of the grant faileth. The grant is indeed only during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of the corporation; which may endure forever; but when that life is determined to be the dissolution of the body politic, the grantor takes it back by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVERSION\">reversion</a>, as in the case of every other grant for life. The debts of a corporation, either to or from it, are totally extinguished by its dissolution; so that the members thereof cannot recover, or be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with them, in their natural capacities: agreeable to that maxim of the civil law, Si quid universitatis debetur, singulis non debetur; nec, quod debet universitas, singulis debent.\n\nA corporation may be dissolved, 1. By act of parliament, which is boundless in its operations. 2. By the natural death of all its members, in cases of an aggregate corporation. 3. By surrender of its franchises into the hands of the king, which is a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUICIDE\">suicide</a>. 4. By forfeiture of its charter, through negligence or abuse of its franchises, in which case the law judges that the body politic has broken the conditions upon which it was incorporated, and therefore the incorporation is void. And the regular course is to bring an information in nature of a writ of quo warranto, to inquire by what warrant the members now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> their corporate power, having forfeited it by such and such proceedings. The exertion of this act of law, for the purposes of the state, in the reigns of King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> and King James II. particularly by seizing the charter of the city of London, gave great and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> offence; though perhaps, in strictness of law, the proceedings in most of them were sufficiently regular; but the judgment against that of London was reversed by act of parliament after the revolution; and by the same statute it is enacted, that the franchises of the city of London shall never more be forfeited for any cause whatsoever. And because by the common law corporations were dissolved, in case the mayor or head officer was not duly elected on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> appointed in the charter or established by prescription, it is now provided, that for the future no corporation shall be dissolved upon that account, and ample directions are given for appointing a new officer, in case there be no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a>, or a void one, made upon the charter or prescriptive day.","sp":306,"ep":309},{"h":"CORPORATION ACT","t":"is that which prevents any person from being legally elected into any office relating to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> corporation, unless within a twelvemonth before he has received the sacrament of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">Supper</a> according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of England; and which enjoins him to take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> and supremacy when he takes the oath of office; otherwise his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> is void.","sp":309,"ep":309},{"h":"CORPOREITY","t":"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of that which is corporeal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> has body; or that which constitutes or denominates it such.\u2014The corporeity of God was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of the Anthropomorphites.

The benefit\narising to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, and the reformation of offenders,\nfrom this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of punishment, have been variously esti-\nmated by different writers, according to the views\nwhich they have taken of the effects and consequences\nwhich are supposed to follow the confinement and re-\nstraint to which the criminal is subjected. It has\nbeen regarded as one of the greatest defects of the\nlaws of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, that, excepting the punishment\nof <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other which is accompanied with\nthat degree of severity and terror to awe or restrain\noffenders from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of crimes. To this pur-\npose are the following observations of Dr Paley. The\nlaws of England, he says, \"are not provided with any\nother punishment than that of death, sufficiently terri-\nble to keep offenders in awe. Transportation which is\nthe punishment <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> in the order of severity, answers\nthe purpose of example very imperfectly; not only be-\ncause exile is in reality a slight punishment to those who\nhave neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, nor friends, nor regular means\nCorrection of subsistence at home, but because the punishment, whatever it be, is unobserved and unknown. A transported convict may suffer under his sentence, but his sufferings are removed from the view of his countrymen; his misery is unseen; his condition strikes no terror into the minds of those for whose warning and admonition it was intended. This chasm in the scale of punishment produces also two farther imperfections in the administration of penal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>; of which the first is, that the same punishment is extended to crimes of very different characters and malignancy; and the second, that punishments, separated by a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, are assigned to crimes hardly distinguishable in their guilt and mischief.\n\nThis defect, it has been supposed might be made up by the proper management of houses of correction. For as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of punishment is not only the amendment of the offender, but is also intended to operate as an example to others, both these objects seem to be more certainly attained by the confinement and labour to which criminals are subjected in houses of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> than by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of punishment provided by the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. It is greatly to be regretted that the punishments inflicted by the laws of this country, whether imprisonment or exile, pain or infamy, have rarely the effect of producing any reformation of the criminal. On the contrary he often returns to the world more hardened in crime, and more determined in his wicked courses. Houses of correction might probably in this respect be attended with more beneficial consequences. This seems to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a> house of correction, an account of which in this view <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not, it is hoped, be unacceptable to our readers. It is extracted from the Journal of the Travels of M. Thouin.\n\nThe Amsterdam correction house, from the employment of the prisoners confined in it, is called the rapping-house, and is destined to the reception of those malefactors whose crimes do not amount to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> offence. Their punishment cannot so properly be denominated solitary confinement as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEQUESTRATION\">sequestration</a> from society during a limited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of years. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> is situated in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the suburbs to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-east of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>. The exterior has nothing remarkable, either with respect to form or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>. It is detached from the street by a spacious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, which contains the keeper's lodge, together with apartments for the different servants belonging to the establishment. Over the gate, which opens from this court into the prison, are placed two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a>, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, representing two men in the act of sawing a piece of logwood.\n\nThe inner court is in the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, round which are arranged the apartments of the prisoners, together with the necessary warehouses. One part of the ground story is divided into different chambers; the other serves as a depot for the logwood, and the implements employed in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>.\n\nThe keeper, whose countenance, contrary to the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of persons of his profession, was strongly indicative of urbanity and gentleness, introduced M. Thouin into an apartment where two prisoners were at work in sawing a large log of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMPEACHY\">Campeachy</a> wood. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> is composed of four blades joined together, with very strong, large, and sharp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, which make a scissure in the wood of nearly two inches in breadth. The operation is repeated, till the pieces become too small to undergo the saw, when they are ground in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a> peculiarly constructed for this purpose.\n\nThis employment requires an extraordinary exertion of strength, and is at first a severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENANCE\">penance</a> even to robust persons; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, and practice, soon render it easy; and the prisoners in a short time become competent to furnish, without painful exertion, their weekly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINGENT\">contingent</a> of 200 lbs. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of sawed pieces. After completing this task, they even find time to fabricate a variety of little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> in wood and straw, which they sell to those who visit the prison, or dispose of, by means of agents, in the town.\n\nM. Thouin next inspected three apartments of different dimensions, which opened into the inner court. The one was inhabited by four, the second by six, and the third by ten prisoners. The furniture of the rooms consisted in hammocks, with a mattress, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLANKET\">blanket</a>, and a coverlid to each, tables, chairs, and stools, glafs, &c., earthen vessels, and various other articles of convenience. Everything in these apartments was distinguished by neatness and propriety; and notwithstanding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of inhabitants allotted to each was fully adequate to the dimensions of the rooms, the senses were not offended with any disagreeable scent, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> was in every respect as pure and wholesome as the surrounding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>.\n\nIn an obscure part of the building are a number of cells, in which formerly those prisoners who revolted against the proper subordination of the place, or ill-treated their comrades, were confined for a few days. But the keeper assured M. Thouin that these cells had not been made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of for upwards of 10 years. They are dark gloomy dungeons, with only a small aperture for the admission of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and air. The suppression of this barbarous and coercive punishment does <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>.\n\nThe store-rooms are filled with various kinds of wood for the purposes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYEING\">dyeing</a>; as the hematosylum campechianum, the morus tinctoria, the caesalpinia japonica, &c. They are all exotics, with the exception of the evonymus Europaeus. The warehouses were not of sufficient extent to contain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of wood, which was deposited in piles in different parts of the court.\n\nThe prisoners, amounting to 76 in number, were uniformly habited in coarse woollens; wear very good stockings, large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> shoes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> flints, and caps or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a>. They are, by the rules of the house, obliged to frequent ablutions, which greatly contribute to the preservation of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>. There was only one sick person amongst them; and, what is not a little remarkable, almost all the prisoners had formerly lived in large commercial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>; very few villagers were amongst them. They had all been sentenced to imprisonment for theft; but it depends upon themselves, by reformation and good behaviour, to shorten the term of their confinement, which many of them frequently do.\n\nThe keeper, whose humanity to the unfortunate persons committed to his care entitles him rather to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of their protector than their gaoler (and M. Thouin informs us, that the prisoners generally called him by no other name than father), afflicts them with his counsels and friendly admonitions. He registers every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, in a book appropriated to this purpose, both the instances of good and bad behaviour, which is annually submitted.\nCorrection submitted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the magistracy, who, from this report, abridge or prolong the term of confinement, according to the degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> which each prisoner appears to merit. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">Cases</a> frequently happen where a malefactor, condemned to an imprisonment of eight years, by his good behaviour procures his enlargement at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> of four; and so in proportion for a shorter term. But great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> is paid to discriminate between actual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> and hypocritical artifice.\n\nThe reward of good behaviour is not, however, confined to, or withheld till, the period of actual liberation. Their restoration to society is preceded by a progressive amelioration of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a>. Their work is gradually rendered less laborious, they are accommodated with separate apartments, and employed in the services of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> economy. The keeper even entrusts them with commissions beyond the precincts of the prison; and scarce a single instance has occurred of their abusing this indulgence. By this prudent management, a considerable saving is effected in the expense of the establishment, at the same time that it tends to wear away <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>, and to initiate the prisoners by gradual advances into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> duties of social life.\n\nM. Thouin made particular inquiries whether it was customary for persons after their discharge to be confined a second and third time, as is but too often the case in many countries, for a repetition of their offence. He was informed, that such instances very rarely occur; but the case is not without precedent, as he observed in the person of a young Jew, who was then in the rapping-house for the third time. The case of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> is somewhat extraordinary. During the period of his detention, he always conforms, with the most scrupulous observance, to the rules of the place, and gives general satisfaction by his exemplary conduct. But such, as he himself avowed to our traveller, is his constitutional propensity to thieving, that no sooner is the term of his imprisonment elapsed, than he returns with redoubled ardour to his lawless courses. It is not so much for the sake of plunder, as to gratify his irresistible impulse, that he follows this vicious life; and M. Thouin adds, that he recounted his different exploits with as much exultation and triumph as a veteran displays when rehearsing his warlike achievements.\n\nAnother salutary regulation in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a>, from which the best consequences result, is the indulgence granted to the prisoners of receiving the visits of their wives and mistresses twice every week. Proper care, however, is taken to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against the introduction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>; and the ladies, in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, purchase their admission by giving a trifling sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> at the gate, which becomes the perquisite of the aged prisoners, whose wants are of a different nature from their youthful comrades. Thus the pleasures of one class contribute to the comforts of the other; and the entrance money, trifling as it is, keeps away a crowd of idle vagabonds, who have no acquaintance with the prisoners. The ladies at their visits are permitted to eat and drink with their lovers; and when the conversation becomes too animated for a third person to be present, the rest of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> obligingly take the hint, and leave them to enjoy a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate.\u2014By this prudent regulation, many hurtful consequences attendant on a total seclusion from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> society are guarded against.\n\nM. Thouin concludes his account with observing, that the rapping-house at Amsterdam bears a greater resemblance to a well-ordered manufactury than to a prison. It were to be wished, that all similar institutions were conducted upon a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>.\n\nBut it is probable that solitary confinement and less intercourse with their friends would have a better effect in reforming the habits of offenders than the indulgences which M. Thouin considers as so beneficial. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> whom we formerly quoted observes, that \"of reforming punishments none promises so much success as that of solitary imprisonment, or the confinement of criminals in separate apartments. This improvement of the Amsterdam house of correction would augment the terror of the punishment, would seclude the criminal from the society of his fellow-prisoners, in which society the worst are sure to corrupt the better; would wean him from the knowledge of his companions, and from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of that turbulent pernicious life in which his vices had engaged him; would raise up in him reflections on the folly of his choice, and dispose his mind to such bitter and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENITENCE\">penitence</a>, as might produce a lasting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in the principles of his conduct.\"\n\nIn addition to the confinement and labour which offenders undergo in houses of correction, some are subjected to whipping at certain stated intervals. The benefit arising from this mode of punishment, with regard to the reformation of the criminal, has been justly questioned. If any good effect is to be expected from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>, it must be inflicted in private. It has been observed by one* who knew <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> nature well,* Fielding, that punishment which deprives a man of all sense of honour will never contribute to make him virtuous; and it is generally found that the folder who has once been whipped, becomes quite indifferent to propriety of conduct. Fasting, which is not attended with shame, promises to be a more effectual punishment of profligacy.","sp":310,"ep":312},{"h":"CORRECTOR","t":"in Medicine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARMACY\">Pharmacy</a>, an ingredient in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, which guards against or abates the force of another.","sp":312,"ep":312},{"h":"CORREGIDOR","t":"the name of an officer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, and countries subject to the Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>.

With respect to products, Corsica has nothing peculiar to itself; but from the earliest times it has been famous for its swarms of bees, and produces vast quantities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>, which, however, is reckoned bitter, on account of the box and yew with which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> abounds.

After many revolutions, this island was, for some centuries, under the dominion of the Genoese, whose tyranny was such, that the Corsicans were almost in a perpetual state of insurrection. In 1736, a German adventurer, Theodore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">baron</a> Newhoff, brought some assistance to them, and, on his assurances of more powerful aid, they elected him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>; but, as he could not substantiate his promises, he was obliged to leave the island. He came to England, was thrown into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">Fleet</a> prison, released by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of insolvency (after having registered his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of Corsica for the benefit of his creditors) and suffered to die in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> indigence. The Genoese tired of the contest, sold the sovereignty to France, in 1767, and the celebrated Paoli, who had been elected to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> command, in 1755, was obliged to abandon the island in 1769. After the French revolution, in 1789, Corsica was admitted as an eighty-third department of France, at the particular request of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPUTATION\">deputation</a>, of which Paoli was at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, however, of some events which followed the revolution of 1792, Paoli revolted; the French, by the assistance of the English, were expelled from the island; and Corsica, on the 19th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1794, was declared annexed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, according to a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, which had been previously formed.

The word implies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> troops of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>. These people are divided into European and Asiatic Cossacks. The first consist of the Zaporog, who dwell below the cataract of the Dnieper, some on the side next to Russia, and others on the opposite side of that river; the Lower and Upper Cossacks; the Bielgorod Cossacks; and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the Don Cossacks. The Asiatic Cossacks are composed of the rest of the Don Cossacks, the Grebin Cossacks, the Yaik Cossacks, and the Western Calmucks, who retiring from those that inhabited the south borders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a> under Yauki Can, settled upon the Wolga, and are dependent upon Russia.\n\nThe Cossacks were known by that name ever since the 948th year of Christ. They dwelt upon Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAUCASUS\">Caucasus</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> now called Kabardy; and were reduced under the Russian dominion by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> Miloslav in the year 1621. Many Russians, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">Poles</a>, and others, who could not live at home, have, at different times been admitted among the Cossacks: but the latter, attracted from these fugitives, must have been an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and well governed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>.\n\nTowards the beginning of the 16th century, the Zaporog Cossacks fixed their habitations on the spacious plains that extend along the banks of the Dnieper. They had undergone considerable hardships from the incursions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a>, for which they afterwards found means to avenge themselves in an ample manner. The Poles being sensible how serviceable the Cossacks might be in defending them from the ravages of the Tartars, and even of the Russians, proposed to them terms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a>. In 1562, they solemnly took them under their protection, and engaged to pay them an annual subsidy; in return for which the Cossacks were to keep on foot a sufficient body of troops for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the Polish dominions. With a view to bind them still more strongly by ties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, the Poles gave them the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> between the rivers Dnieper and Neister, and the borders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a>. The Cossacks applied themselves with great industry to the cultivation of this fertile spot; so that in a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> it was interspersed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> and handsome villages. Besides, they continually harassed the Turks, and did them great damage by their incursions; and, in order to prevent the latter from pursuing them, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPRISALS\">reprisals</a>, they posted themselves of several small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> in the Dnieper, where they kept their magazines, &c. The hetman or general of the Cossacks was not in the least subordinate to the field marshal of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a>; but acted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> with him as an ally, and not as a subject of that republic. But this alliance, though of such manifest advantage to both parties, was not of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>. The Poles, seeing the vast improvements made by the Cossacks in the country they had given up to them, became envious of them, and actually made an attempt to bring them into subjection, as we have seen in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of Poland. In 1648 the Cossacks gained great advantages over them, and next year came to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>, in which they not only preserved their old immunities, but obtained additional privileges. The result of all was, that these Cossacks remained under the protection of Russia; and as their former country was entirely laid waste in the late wars, they settled in the Russian Ukraine, upon receiving formal assurances from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of Russia, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> should be made in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, and that no taxes whatever should be laid upon them. The Cossacks, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, were always to keep in readiness a good body of troops for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of Russia: but in the year 1708 Mazeppa, their hetman or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a>, went over from the Russians to the Swedes; upon which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> I. resolved to prevent such revolts for the future. To this end, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Poltava, he sent a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> into the above-mentioned little islands in the Dnieper, whither the Cossacks had fled with their wives and children, and all their effects; and ordered them all to be put to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> without distinction, and the plunder to be divided among his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>. He likewise sent a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of men into their country, and caused several thousands of the Cossacks to be carried to the coasts of the Baltic, where they were put to all sorts of hard labour; by which means he in a manner extirpated the whole nation.\n\nWhat distinguishes the Zaporog Cossacks from all other people is, that they never suffer any women in their settlements, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMAZONS\">Amazons</a> are said not to have suffered any men among them. The women of these Cossacks live in other islands of the Dnieper. They never marry, nor have any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>; all their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> children are enrolled as soldiers, and the females are left with their mothers. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> often has children by his sister, and the father by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>. They know no laws but those which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> has introduced, founded on their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> wants; though they have among them some priests of the Greek persuasion. They serve in the armies as irregulars; and woe to those who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>.\n\nThe country of these Cossacks, who are an afflame of ancient Roxolans, Sarmatians, and Tartars, is called the Ocraine or Ukraine. It lies upon the borders of Russia and Poland, Little Tartary, and Turkey, and was anciently a part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCYTHIA\">Scythia</a>. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> settled between Russia and Poland, in 1693, the latter remains in possession of all that part of the Ukraine which is situated on the west side of the Dnieper, and is now but poorly cultivated. That on the east side, inhabited by the Cossacks, is in a much better condition, and extends about two hundred and sixty miles in length, and as many in breadth. It is one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> fertile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, watered by a great number of fine rivers, diversified with pleasant woods, and yields such plenty of all sorts of grain, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>\nCossacks. honey and wax, as to supply a great part of the Russian empire with those commodities. Its pastures are exceeding rich, and its cattle very large; but the inhabitants are greatly plagued by locusts, which infest this fine country. The houses in the Ukraine are, like those of the Russians, mostly built with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>.\n\nThe Cossacks are tall and well made, generally hawked, and of a good mien. They are hardy, vigorous, brave, and extremely jealous of what is most valuable in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>; fickle and wavering, but sociable, cheerful, and sprightly. They are a very powerful people, and their forces consist wholly of cavalry.\u2014Their dialect is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> of the Polish and Russian languages; but the latter is the most predominant. They were formerly Pagans or Mahometans; but upon their entering into the Polish service, they were baptized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> of the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a>; and now that they belong to Russia, they profess themselves members of the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>.\n\nEach of their towns, with the district belonging to it, is governed by an officer called ottomann or attamann.\n\nThe Don Cossacks, so called from their residence upon the banks of the river Don, greatly resemble those already described. In the year 1559, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CZAR\">Czar</a> Ivan Basilowicz was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> of Russia, they voluntarily put themselves under his protection, and are at this time on a pretty equal footing with the other Russian subjects. They have several towns and villages upon the banks of the Don; but are prevented from extending themselves farther up the country, by the scarcity of fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> and wood in many places. Their chief support is grazing and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, and occasionally robbing and plundering, for which they want neither capacity nor inclination. Every town is governed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> called tamann; and the tamanns, with their towns, are under the jurisdiction of two ottomans, who reside at Thierkatky. The troops of these Cossacks likewise consist entirely of cavalry. In this country all the towns and villages are fortified and encompassed with palisades, to defend them against the incursions of the Calmucks and Kuban Tartars, with whom they are continually at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>. The Cossacks, in general, are of great service to garrison towns by way of defence, or to pursue an enemy; but are not so good at regular attacks.\n\nThe Sieth Cossacks, who are also called Haidamacks, have their particular hetman. They inhabit the Russian, Polish, and Turkish dominions, along the banks of the Dnieper.\n\nThe Yaik Cossacks dwell on the south side of the river Yaik; and upon the success of the Russian arms in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of Astrakhan, voluntarily submitted to them. In stature they greatly resemble the other Cossacks; though by their boorish manner of living, and intermarriages with the Tartars, they have not the shape and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> peculiar to the rest of their countrymen. Their natural dispositions and customs are, however, nearly the same. Husbandry, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a>, and feeding of cattle, are their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> employments; and, like the other tribes, they let slip no opportunity of making depredations on their neighbours. Their continual wars with the Kara-Kalpacs and the Kafatshaia-Horda oblige them to keep their towns and villages in a state of defence. They are indeed subject to Russian waiwodes, to whom they pay an annual tribute in corn, wax, honey, and cattle; but they have also their particular chiefs, who govern them according to their ancient customs. Though the generality of the Yaik Cossacks profess the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, yet a great many relics of Mahometanism and Paganism are still found among them. Being naturally bold and hardy, they make excellent soldiers; and they are not so turbulent as the other Cossacks. They live entirely at peace with the Calmucks and their other neighbours, and even maintain a commercial intercourse with them.","sp":318,"ep":319},{"h":"COSSE DE GENISTE","t":"an order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHTHOOD\">knighthood</a> instituted in 1244, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> IX. at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> with Margaret of Provence.

See PARLIAMENT.\n\n2. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEERS\">peers</a> of the realm are by their birth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> counsellors of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>; and may be called together by the king, to impart their advice in all matters of importance to the realm, either in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of parliament, or, which hath been their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, when there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> parliament in being. Accordingly, Bracton, speaking of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> of his time, says, they might properly be called \"consoles a confundendum;\" reges enim tales fibi afficiant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a> confundendum.\" And in the law-books it is laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, that the peers are created for two reasons: 1. Ad confundendum, 2. Ad defendendum, regem: for which reasons the law gives them certain great and high privileges; such as freedom from arrests, &c., even when no parliament is sitting; because the law intends, that they are always afflicting the king with their counsel for the commonwealth, or keeping the realm in safety by their prowess and valour.\n\nInstances of conventions of the peers, to advise the king, have been in former times very frequent; though now fallen into disuse, by reason of the more regular meetings of parliament. Sir Edward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COKE\">Coke</a> gives us an extract of a record, 5 Henry IV., concerning an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> of lands between the king and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHUMBERLAND\">Northumberland</a>, wherein the value of each was agreed to be settled by advice of parliament (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> any should be called before the feast of St Lucia), or otherwise by advice of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> council of peers, which the king promises to assemble before the said feast, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> no parliament shall be called. Many other instances of this\nthis kind of meeting are to be found under our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> kings: though the formal method of convoking them had been so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> left off, that when King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I. in 1640 issued out writs under the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a> to call a council of all the peers of England, to meet and attend his majesty at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, previous to the meeting of the long parliament, the earl of Clarendon mentions it as a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, not before heard of: that is, as he explains himself, so old, that it had not been practised in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a> of years. But though there had not for long time before been an instance, nor has there been any fine, of assembling them in so solemn a manner, yet in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of emergency, our princes have at several times thought proper to call for, and consult as many of the nobility as could easily be brought together: as was particularly the case with King James II. after the landing of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a>; and with the prince of Orange himself before he called the convention parliament which afterwards called him to the throne.\n\nBesides this general meeting, it is usually looked upon to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of each particular peer of the realm, to demand an audience of the king, and to lay before him with decency and respect such matters as he shall judge of importance to the public weal. And therefore, in the reign of Edward II., it was made an article of impeachment in parliament against the two Hugh Spencers, father and son, for which they were banished the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, \"that they by their evil counsels would not suffer the great men of the realm, the king's good counsellors, to speak with the king, or to come near him; but only in presence and hearing of said Hugh the father and Hugh the son, or one of them, and at their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, and according to such things as pleased them.\"\n\n3. A third council belonging to the king, are, according to Sir Edward Coke, his judges of the courts of law, for law-matters. And this appears frequently in the English statutes, particularly Edward III. c. 5, and in other books of law. So that when the king's council is mentioned generally, it must be defined, particularized, and understood, secundum subjectam materiam; \"according to the subject <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>;\" and if the subject be of a legal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, then by the king's council is understood his council for matters of law; namely, his judges. Therefore, when by statute Richard II. c. 5, it was made a high offence to import into England any papal bulls, or other processes from Rome; and it was enacted, that the offenders should be attached by their bodies and brought before the king and his council to answer for such offence; here, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of king's council, were understood the king's judges of his courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, the subject matter being legal: this being the general way of interpreting the word council.\n\n4. But the principal council belonging to the king is his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-PRIVY_COUNCIL\">privy council</a>, which is generally by way of eminence, called the council.

See Aulic.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">Common</a> Council, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, is a court wherein are made all bye-laws which bind the citizens. It consists, like the parliament, of two houses; an upper, composed of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a>-mayor and aldermen; and a lower, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of common-council men, chosen by the several wards, as representatives of the body of the citizens.\n\nCouncil of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">War</a>, an assembly of the principal officers of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, occasionally called by the general or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a> to concert measures for their conduct with regard to sieges, retreats, engagements, &c.\n\nCouncil, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, an assembly of prelates and doctors, met for the regulating matters relating to the doctrine or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> of the church.\n\nNational Council, is an assembly of the prelates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> under their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMATE\">primate</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a>.\n\nOecumenical or General Council, is an assembly which represents the whole body of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> church.

They are as follows: 1. The council of Nice, held in the reign of Constantine the Great, on account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARIUS\">Arius</a>. 2. The council of Constantinople, called under the reign and by the command of Theodosius the Great, for much the same end that the former council was summoned. 3. The council of Ephesus, convened by Theodosius the younger at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NESTORIUS\">Nestorius</a>. 4. The council of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHALCEDON\">Chalcedon</a>, held in the reign of Martinus, which approved of the Eutychian heresy. 5. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> council of Constantinople, assembled by the emperor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTINIAN\">Justinian</a>, condemned the three chapters taken out of the book of Theodorus of Mopsuestia, having first decided that it was lawful to anathematize the dead. Some authors tell us, that they likewise condemned the several errors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGEN\">Origen</a> about the Trinity, the plurality of worlds, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRE_EXISTENCE\">pre-existence</a> of souls. 6. The third council of Constantinople, held by the command of Constantius Pogonatus the emperor, in which they received the definitions of the five first general councils, and particularly that against Origen and Theodorus of Mopsuestia. 7. The second Nicene council. 8. The fourth council of Constantinople, assembled when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> II. was emperor of the West.

A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> has of late years prevailed of granting letters patent of precedence to such barristers as the crown thinks proper to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> with that mark of distinction: whereby they are entitled to such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and preaudience as are assigned in their respective patents; sometimes next after the king's attorney-general, but usually next after his majesty's counsel next being. These, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>'s attorney and solicitor general, rank promiscuously with the king's counsel; and, together with them, fit within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> of their respective courts: but receive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> salaries, and are not sworn; and therefore are at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to be retained in caules against the crown.

The origin of what we now call counts seems owing to Augustus, who took several senators to be his comiter, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DION\">Dion</a> observes, i.e. to accompany him in his voyages and travels, and to assist him in the hearing of caules; which were thus judged with the same authority as in full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>. Gallienus seems to have abolished this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, by forbidding the senators being found in the armies; and none of his successors re-established it.\n\nThese counsellors of the emperor were really counts, comites, i.e. companions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>; and they sometimes took the title thereof, but always with the addition of the emperor's name whom they accompanied: so that it was rather a mark of their office than a title of dignity.\u2014Constantine was the first who converted it into a dignity; and under him it was that the name was first given absolutely. The name once established, was in a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> indifferently conferred, not only on those who followed the court, and accompanied the emperor, but also on most kinds of officers; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> whereof is given us by Du Cange.\n\nEusebius tells us, that Constantine divided the counts into three classes; the first bore the title of illustres; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> that of clarissimi, and afterwards spectabiles; the third were called perfectissimi. Of the two first classes was the senate composed: those of the third had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the senate, but enjoyed several other of the privileges of senators.\n\nThere were counts who served on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, others at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>; some in a civil, some in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a>, and some in a legal capacity: as comes avarii, comes sacrarum largitionum, comes sacri confessorii, comes curiae, comes capelle, comes archiatriorum, comes commerciorum, comes vexillationis, comes horrorum, comes opifiorum or annonae, comes domesticonum, comes equorum regiorum or comes stabuli, comes domorum, comes excubitorum, comes notariorum, comes legum or professor in jure, comes liminum or marcarum, comes portus Romae, comes patrimonii, &c.\nThe Franks, Germans, &c., passing into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a> and Germany, did not abolish the form of the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>; and as the governors of cities and provinces were called *counts*, *comites*, and *dukes*, *duces*, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be called so. They commanded in time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>; and in time of peace they administered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. Thus, in the time of Charlemagne, counts were the ordinary judges and governors of the cities.\n\nThese counts of cities were beneath the dukes and counts who presided over provinces; the first being constituted in the particular cities under the jurisdiction of the latter. The counts of provinces were in nothing inferior to dukes, who themselves were only governors of provinces. Under the last of the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of French kings, they got their dignity rendered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>, and even usurped the sovereignty when Hugh Capet came to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>; his authority was not sufficient to oppose their encroachments; and hence it is they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a> the privilege of wearing coronets in their arms; they assumed it then, as enjoying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of sovereigns in their particular districts or counties. But, by degrees, most of the counties became reunited to the crown.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of count is now become very different from what it was anciently; being now no more than a title, which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> grants upon erecting a territory into a county, with a reserve of jurisdiction and sovereignty to himself. At first there was no clause in the patent of erection, intimating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVERSION\">reversion</a> of the county to the crown in default of heirs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a>; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> IX. to prevent their being too numerous, ordained that duchies and counties, in default of heirs male, should return to the crown.\n\nThe point of precedence between counts and marquises was formerly much controverted; the reason was, that there were counts who were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEERS\">peers</a> of France, but no marquises; but the point was given up, and marquises took place; though anciently, when counts were governors of provinces, they were on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> even with dukes.\n\nWilliam the Conqueror, as is observed by Camden, gave the dignity of counts in fee to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a>; annexing it to this or that county or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>, and allotting for their maintenance a certain proportion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, arising from the prince's profits in the pleadings and forfeitures of the provinces. To this purpose he quotes an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> record, thus: Hen. II. Rex Anglie hic verbiis comitem creavit; scitis nos fecisse Hugonem Bigot comitem de Norf, &c. de tercio denario de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWICH\">Norwich</a> et <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORFOLK\">Norfolk</a>, sicut aliquis comes Angliae, &c.\n\nThe Germans call a count, *graf*, or *graff*; which, according to a modern critic, properly signifies judge; and is derived from *gravio* or *grafio*, of *gravio*, I write. They have several kinds of these counts or grafts; as landgraves, marchgraves, burg-graves, and palgrave, or counts palatine. These last are of two kinds; the former are of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of princes, and have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTITURE\">investiture</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALATINATE\">palatinate</a>; the others have only the title of *count palatine* without the investiture of any palatinate. Some assert, that by publicly professing the imperial laws for twenty years, the person acquires the dignity of a count palatinate; and there are instances of professors in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> who have assumed the title accordingly; but there are others who question this right.\n\n**Count**, in Law, denotes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> in a real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>; as the declaration is in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> one: the libellus of the civilians answers to both. Yet, count and declaration are sometimes confounded, and used for each other; as, count in debt, count in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a>, &c.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTER\">Counter</a>-Wheel**, in the striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a clock, a wheel which moves round once in 12 or 24 hours. It is sometimes called the locking-wheel. See Clock-Making.\n\n**Counter**, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> which enters into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> words of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, and generally implies opposition; but when applied to deeds, means an exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> kept of the contrary party, and sometimes signed by both parties.\n\n**Counter-Changed**, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HERALDRY\">Heraldry</a>, the intermixture or opposition of any metal with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>.\n\n**Counter-Flory**, in Heraldry, is said of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>-de-luce are opposite to others.

Sometimes it is done on glass, and with frames or nets divided into squares with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> or with thread, and also by means of instruments invented for the purpose, as the parallelogram.\n\n**Counter-Ermine**, in Heraldry, is the contrary of ermine, being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> field with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> spots.\n\n**Counterfeits**, in Law, are persons that obtain any money or goods by counterfeit letters or false tokens, who being convicted before justices of assize or of the peace, &c., are to suffer such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> as shall be thought fit to be inflicted under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, as imprisonment, pillory, &c.\n\n**Counter-Foil**, or **Counter-Stock**, in the exchequer, that part of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALLY\">tally</a> which is kept by an officer of the court.\n\n**Counter-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">Guard</a>**, in Fortification, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> raised before the point of bastion, consisting of two long faces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the faces of the bastion, making a salient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>; they are sometimes of other shapes, or otherwise situated.\n\n**Counter-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">Light</a>**, or **Counter-jour**, a light opposite to any thing, which makes it appear to disadvantage. A single counter-light is sufficient to take away all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of a fine painting.\n\n**Counter-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>**, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> affairs, a change of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> or wings of a battalion, by which means those that were in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> come to be in the rear. It also signifies returning, or marching back again.\n\n**Counter-Mine**, in War, a well and gallery drove and sunk till it meet the enemy's mine, to prevent its effect.\n\n**Counter-Paled**, in Heraldry, is when the escutcheon is divided into twelve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALES\">pales</a> paited per fesse, the two colours being counter-changed; so that the upper are of one colour and the lower of another.\n\n**Counter-Part**, in Music, denotes one part to be applied to another. Thus the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASS\">bass</a> is said to be a counter-part to the treble.\n\n**Counter-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSANT\">Passant</a>**, in Heraldry, is when two lions are in a coat of arms, and the one seems to go quite the contrary way from the other.\nCounter-Point, in Music, a term derived from the Latin preposition contra and the verb pingere; because the musical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> by which the notes in each part are signified are placed in such a manner, each with respect to each, as to show how the parts answer one another. See Composition.\n\nCounter-Pointed (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONTRE\">Contre</a>-pointe), in Heraldry, is when two chevrons in one escutcheon meet in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, the one rising as usual from the base, and the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a> falling from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a>; so that they are counter to one another in the points. They may also be counter-pointed when they are founded upon the sides of the shield, and the points meet that way, called counter-pointed in fesse.\n\nCounterpoise, in the manege, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of the action and seat of a horseman; so that in all the motions made by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, he does not incline his body more to one side than to the other, but continues in the middle of the saddle, being equally on his stirrups, in order to give the horse the proper and fashionable aids.\n\nCounter-potent (contre potence), in Heraldry, is reckoned a fur as well as vair and ermine; but composed of such pieces as represent the tops of crutches, called in French potences, and in old English potents.\n\nCounter-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, in rolling-press <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a>, a print taken off from another fresh printed; which by being passed through the press, gives the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of the former, but inverted. To counter-prove, is also to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> a design in black <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> chalk, through the press, after having moistened with a sponge both that and the paper on which the counter-proof is to be taken.\n\nCounter-quartered (contre-ecartel\u00e9), in Heraldry, denotes the escutcheon, after being quartered, to have each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> again divided into two.\n\nCounter-Saliant, is when two beasts are borne in a coat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAPING\">leaping</a> from each other directly the contrary way.\n\nCounter-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCARP\">Scarp</a>, in Fortification, is properly the exterior talus or slope of the ditch; but it is often taken for the covered way and the glacis. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> we say, the enemy have lodged themselves in the counter-scarp. Angle of the counter-scarp, is that made by two sides of the counter-scarp, meeting before the middle of the curtain.\n\nCounter-Signing, the signing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> of a superior in quality of secretary. Thus charters are signed by the king, and counter-signed by a secretary of state, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a>.\n\nCounter-Time, in the manege, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> or resistance of a horse that interrupts his cadence, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of his manege, occasioned either by a bad horseman or by the malice of a horse.\n\nCounter, is also the name of a counting-board in a shop, and of a piece of metal with a stamp on it, used in playing at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDS\">cards</a>.\n\nCounter of a Horse, that part of a horse's forehand which lies between the shoulders and under the neck.\n\nCounters in a ship are two. 1. The hollow arching from the gallery to the lower part of the straight piece of the stern, is called the upper-counter. 2. The lower counter is between the transom and the lower part of the gallery.\n\nCounter, is also the name of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRISONS\">prisons</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, viz. the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POULTRY\">Poultry</a> and Woodstreet.\n\nCountors, Countours, or Counters, has been used for sergeants at law, retained to defend a cause, or to speak for their client in any course of law.\n\nIt is of these Chaucer speaks:\n\n\u2014 A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a> had he been, and a countour,\nWas nowhere such a worthy vavasour.\n\nThey were anciently called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERGEANT\">sergeant</a> contours.\n\nCountries, among the miners, a term or appellation they give to their works under ground.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">Country</a>, among geographers, is used indifferently to denote either a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, province, or lesser district. But its most frequent use is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> to town.\n\nCountry-Dance is of English origin, though now transplanted into almost all the countries and courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. There is no established rule for the composition of tunes to this dance, because there is in music no kind of time whatever which may not be measured by the motions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a>; and there are few long tunes of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> within the last century, that have not been applied to country-dances.\n\nCounty, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a>, originally signified the territory of a count or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a>, but now it is used in the same sense with shire; the one word coming from the French, the other from the Saxon.\u2014In this view, a county is a circuit or portion of the realm; into fifty-two of which, the whole land, England and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, is divided for its better government and the more easy administration of justice.\n\nFor the execution of the laws in the several counties excepting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a>, Westmorland, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURHAM\">Durham</a>, every Michaelmas term officers are appointed, under the denomination of sheriffs. Other officers of the several counties are, a lord-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a>, who has the command of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a> of the county; custodes rotulorum, justices of peace, bailiffs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTABLE\">constable</a>, and coroner.\n\nOf the fifty-two counties, there are three of special note, which are therefore termed counties palatine, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANCASTER\">Lancaster</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHESTER\">Chester</a>, and Durham. See Palatine.\n\nCounty Corporate, is a title given to several cities, or ancient boroughs, on which our monarchs have thought fit to bestow extraordinary privileges; annexing to them a particular territory, land, or jurisdiction; and making them counties of themselves, to be governed by their own sheriffs and magistrates.\n\nCounty Court, in English Law, a court incident to the jurisdiction of the sheriff. It is not a court of record, but may hold pleas of debt or damages under the value of 40s. Over some of which causes these inferior courts have, by the express words of the statute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLOUCESTER\">Gloucester</a>, a jurisdiction totally exclusive of the king's superior courts. For in order to be entitled to sue an action of trespass for goods before the king's justiciaries, the plaintiff is directed to make affidavit that the cause of action does really and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONA\">bona</a> fide amount to 40s, which affidavit is now unaccountably disused, except in the court of exchequer. The statute\ntute also 43 Eliz. c. 6. which gives the judges in many personal actions, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a> affords less damages than 40s. a power to certify the same and abridge the plaintiff of his full costs, was also meant to prevent vexation by litigious plaintiffs; who, for purposes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> oppression, might be inclined to institute such suits in the superior courts for injuries of a trifling value. The county court may also hold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEA\">plea</a> of many real actions, and of all personal actions to any amount, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of a special writ called justici\u00e6; which is a writ empowering the sheriff for the sake of dispatch to do the same justice in this county-court, as might otherwise be had at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a>. The freeholders of the county are the real judges in this court, and the sheriff is the ministerial officer. The great conflux of freeholders, which are supposed always to attend at the county court (which Spelman calls forum plebeiae justitiae et theatrum comitivae potestatis), is the reason why all acts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> at the end of every session were wont to be there published by the sheriff; why all outlaws of absconding offenders are there proclaimed; and why all popular elections which the freeholders are to make, as formerly of sheriffs and conservators of the peace, and still of coroners, verderors, and knights of the shire, must ever be made in pleno comitatu, or in full county-court. By the statute 2 Edw. VI. c. 25. no county-court shall be adjourned longer than for one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, consisting of 28 days. And this was also the ancient usage, as appears from the laws of King Edward the elder; propositus (that is the sheriff) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a> quartam circiter septimanam frequentem populi concionem celebrato; cuique jus dictio; lietique singulas dirimito. In those times the county-court was a court of great dignity and splendour, the bishop and the earldorman (or earl), with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> men of the shire, fitting therein to administer justice both in lay and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> causes. But its dignity was much impaired, when the bishop was prohibited, and the earl neglected to attend it. And, in modern times, as proceedings are removable from hence into the king's superior courts, by writ of pace or recordare, in the same manner as from hundred-courts and courts-baron; and as the same writ of false judgment may be had, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of a writ of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, this has occasioned the same dispute of bringing actions therein.","sp":328,"ep":331},{"h":"COUPAR","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Cupar of Fife, a town in Scotland, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of Fife, about 10 miles west of St Andrew's: W. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">Long</a>. 2. 40.

At the deer.\n\nFor the deer, there are two sorts of courses; the one in the paddock, the other either in the forest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the purlieu. For the paddock course, there must be the greyhound and the terrier, and the mongrel greyhound, whose business it is to drive away the deer before the greyhounds are shipped; a brace or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEASH\">leash</a> are the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> shipped at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, seldom at the utmost more than two brace. In coursing the deer in the forest or purlieu, there are two ways in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>: the one is coursing from wood to wood; and the other, upon the lawns <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> by the keeper's lodge. In the coursing from wood to wood, the way is to throw in some young hounds into the wood to bring out the deer; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> any deer come out that is not weighty, or a deer or antler which is buck, fore, or forrel, then you are not to ship your greyhounds, which are held at the end of the wood, where the keepers, who can guess very well on these occasions, expect that the deer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> come out. If a proper deer come out, and it is suspected that the brace or leash of greyhounds shipped after him will not be able to kill him, it is proper to waylay him with a couple of fresh greyhounds.\n\nThe coursing upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAWN\">lawn</a> is the most agreeable of all other ways. When the keeper has notice of this, he will lodge a deer for the course; and then, by coming under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, the greyhounds may be brought near enough to be shipped for a fair course.\n\nThe best method of coursing the hare, is to go out and find a hare sitting; which is easily done in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, by walking across the lands, either stubble, fallow, or corn grounds, and calling the eye up and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>: for in summer they frequent those places for fear of the ticks, which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in the woods at that season; and in autumn the rains falling from the trees offend them. The rest of the year there is more trouble required; as the bushes and thickets must be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> to rout them, and oftentimes they will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> so close, that they will not stir till the pole almost touches them: the sportsmen are always pleased with this, as it promises a good course. If a hare lies near any close or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVERT\">covert</a>, and with her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> that way, it is always to be expected that she will take to that immediately on being put up; all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> are therefore to ride up and put themselves between her and the covert before she is put up, that she may take the other way, and run upon open ground. When a hare is put up, it is always proper to give her ground, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, as it is called; that is, to let her run 12 score yards, or thereabouts, before the greyhounds are shipped at her; otherwise she is killed too soon, the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the sport is thrown away, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of observing the several turnings and windings that the creature will make to get away is all lost. A good sportsman had rather see a hare <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> herself after a fair course, than see her murdered by the greyhounds as soon as she is up.\n\nIn coursing the fox, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other art is required, than standing close, and in a clear wind, on the outside of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROVE\">grove</a> where it is expected he will come out; and when he is come out, he must have head enough allowed him, otherwise he will return back to the covert. The slowest greyhound will be able to overtake him, after all the odds of distance necessary; and the only danger is the spoiling the dog by the fox, which too frequently happens. For this reason, no greyhound of any value should be run at this course; but the strong, hard, bitter dogs, that will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> anything.\n\nThe laws of coursing established by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORFOLK\">Norfolk</a>, and other sportsmen of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of England, are these:\n\n1. He that is chosen fowlerer or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>-loose of the dogs, shall receive the greyhounds matched to run together into his leash as soon as he comes into the field; he is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> next to the hare-finder, or him who is to start the hare, until he come to the form; and no horseman or footman is to go before or sideways, but all straight behind, for the space of about 40 yards. 2. A hare ought never to be coursed with more than a brace of greyhounds. 3. The hare-finder is to give the hare three whistles before he puts her up from her form or seat, to the end that the dogs may be prepared and attend her starting. 4. If there be not a particular danger of losing the hare, she should have about twelve score yards law. 5. The dog that gives the first turn, if after that there be neither cote, flip, nor wrench, wins the wager. 6. A go-by, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the hare, is counted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to two turns. 7. If neither dog turns the hare, he that leads to the last covert wins. 8. If any dog turns the hare, serves himself, and turns her again, it is as much as a cote, and a cote is esteemed as much as two turns. 9. If all the course be equal, he that bears the hare shall win; and if he be not borne, the course shall\nshall then be judged dead. 10. If a dog take a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> in his course, and yet perform his part, he may challenge the advantage of a turn more than he gave. 11. If a dog turn the hare, serve himself, and give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> cotes, and yet in the end shall stand still in the field, the other dog, if he turns home to the covert, although he gives no other, shall be adjudged to win the wager. 12. If by misfortune a dog be rid over in the course, that course shall be adjudged void, and he that did the mischief is to make reparation to the owner. 13. If a dog gives the first and last turn, and there be no other advantage betwixt them, he that gives the odd turn wins. 14. A cote when a greyhound goes endways by the side of his fellow, and gives the hare a turn. 15. A cote serves for two turns, and two trippings or jerkings for a cote; and if the hare turns not quite about, the only wrenchbeth, in the sportman's phrase. 16. If there be no cotes given by either of the greyhounds, but one serves the other at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a>, then he that gives the most turns wins the wager. 17. Sometimes a hare does not turn, but wrenches; for she does not turn except the turns as it were round. In these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, two wrenches stand for one turn. 18. He that comes in first at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of the hare takes her up, and saves her from breaking; he cherishes the dogs, and cleanses their mouths from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>; he is adjudged to have the hare for his pains. 19. Finally, those who are judges of the leath, must give their judgment before they depart out of the field, or else it is not to stand as valid.","sp":333,"ep":334},{"h":"COURT","t":"an appendage to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> habitation; consisting of a piece of ground inclosed with walls, but open upwards.\n\nCourt is also used for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> or sovereign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> resides.\n\nCourt, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, is defined to be a place wherein <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> is judicially administered.

In all these courts, the king is supposed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of law to be always present; but as that is in fact impossible, he is there represented by his judges, whose power is only an emanation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a>.\n\nFor the more speedy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>, and impartial administration of justice between subject and subject, the law hath appointed a prodigious variety of courts, some with a more limited, others with a more extensive jurisdiction; some constituted to inquire only, others to hear and determine; some to determine in the first instance, others upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> and by way of review. See Law, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a>. xciviii., xcix., c., calii., clvi., clviii., and the respective <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> in the order of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a>. One distinction may be here mentioned, that runs throughout them all; viz. that some of them are courts of record, others not of record. A court of record is that where the acts and judicial proceedings are enrolled in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARCHMENT\">parchment</a> for a perpetual memorial and testimony: which rolls are called the records of the court, and are of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> and supereminent authority, that their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> is not to be called in question. For it is a settled rule and maxim, that nothing shall be averred against a record, nor shall any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEA\">plea</a>, or even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, be admitted to the contrary. And <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the existence of a record be denied, it shall be tried by nothing but itself; that is, upon bare inspection whether there be any such record or not; else there would be no end of disputes. But if there appear any mistake of the clerk in making up such record, the court will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> him to amend it. All courts of record are the king's courts in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of his crown and royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, and therefore no other court hath authority to fine or imprison: so that the very erection of a new jurisdiction with power of fine or imprisonment, makes it instantly a court of record.\u2014A court not of record is the court of a private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; whom the law will not intrust with any discretionary power over the fortune or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of his fellow subjects. Such are the courts-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">baron</a> incident to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANOR\">manor</a>, and other inferior jurisdictions; where the proceedings are not enrolled or recorded; but as well their existence as the truth of the matters therein contained shall, if disputed, be tried and determined by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a>. These courts can hold no plea of matters cognizable by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> law, unless under the value of 40s.; nor of any forcible injury whatsoever, nor having any proceeds to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARREST\">arrest</a> the person of the defendant.\n\nIn every court there must be at least three constituent parts, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTOR\">actor</a>, reus, and judex: the actor, or plaintiff, who complains of an injury done; the reus, or defendant, who is called upon to make satisfaction for it; and the judex, or judicial power, which is to examine the truth of the fact, to determine the law arising upon that fact, and, if any injury appears to have been done, to ascertain, and by its officers to apply the remedy. It is also usual in the superior courts to have attorneys, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> or counsel, as assistants. See Attorney and Counsel.\n\nCourt-Baron, in English Law, a court incident to every manor in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, to be held by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEWARD\">steward</a> within the said manor. This court-baron is of two natures: the one is a customary court, appertaining entirely to the copyholders, in which their estates are transferred by surrender and admittance, and other matters transacted relative to their tenures only. The other is a court of common law, and it is the court of the barons, by which name the freeholders were sometimes anciently called; for that it is held before the freeholders who owe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to the manor, the steward being rather the registrar than the judge. These courts, though in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> distinct, are equally confounded together. The court we are now considering, viz. the freeholder's court, was composed of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a>'s tenants, who were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEERS\">peers</a> of each other, and were bound by their feudal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENURE\">tenure</a> to assist their lord in the dispensation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> justice. This was formerly held every three weeks; and its most important business is to determine, by writ of right, all controversies relating to the right of lands within the manor. It may also hold plea of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> actions, of debt, trespass on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, or the like, where the debt or damages do not amount to 40s.

His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of the Last Judgment, in the vestry of the Minims of the Wood of Vincennes, is much admired. He was also a good sculptor. He wrote several works on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a>; and died after the year 1689.","sp":334,"ep":335},{"h":"COUSU","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HERALDRY\">Heraldry</a>, signifies a piece of another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> metal placed in the ordinary, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it were sewed on, as the word imports.

Leofric, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Mercia, who rebuilt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> after it had been destroyed by the Danes, and was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> of the place about the year 1040, is said, upon some provocation, to have loaded them with heavy taxes. Being importuned by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>, Godina, to remit them, he consented, upon condition that she should ride naked through the town, which he little imagined she would ever comply with. But he found himself mistaken: for she accepted the offer, and rode through the town with her long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> scattered all over her body; having first enjoined the citizens not to venture, on pain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, to look out as she passed. It is said, however, that a certain taylor could not help peeping: and to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> there is an effigy of him at the window whence he looked. To commemorate this extraordinary transaction, and out of respect to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of their patroness, the citizens make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESSION\">procession</a> every year, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of a naked woman on horseback. After Leofric's death, the earls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHESTER\">Chester</a> became lords of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, and granted it many privileges. At length it was annexed to the earldom of Cornwall; and growing considerable, had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> immunities and privileges conferred upon it by several kings; particularly that of a mayor and two bailiffs by Edward III.; and Henry VI. made it, in conjunction with some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> and villages, a distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a>, independent of the county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARWICK\">Warwick</a>. But afterwards Edward VI. for their disloyalty, deprived them of their liberties, which were not restored till they had paid a fine of 500 marks. By a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a> from James I. an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALDERMAN\">alderman</a> is allotted to each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARD\">ward</a>, with the powers of the justices of the peace within the city and its liberties. The walls were ordered to be demolished at the Restoration; and now nothing remains of them but the gates, which are very lofty. Coventry is noted for the two parliaments which were held in it; the one called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> of Dunces, and the other of Devils. The former was so called on account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of the lawyers; and the attainders of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, the earls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALISBURY\">Salisbury</a>, Warwick, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, procured the other the epithet of Devils. The town-house of Coventry is much admired for its painted windows, representing several kings and others that have been benefactors to the city.

The bishopric is said to have been founded by Offa <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Mercia, in the year 656 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 657; and although it hath a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> name, yet, like Bath and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELLS\">Wells</a>, it is a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a>. It was so extremely wealthy, that King Offa, by the favour of Pope Adrian, constituted it an archiepiscopal see; but\nthis title was laid aside on the death of that king. In 1075, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>, the 34th bishop, removed the see to Chester. In 1102, Robert de Limsey, his immediate successor, removed it to Coventry; and Hugo Novant, the 41st bishop, removed it back to Lichfield, but with great opposition from the monks of Coventry. The dispute was finally settled in a manner nearly similar to that which is mentioned between Bath and Wells. Here it was agreed that the bishop should be styled from both places, and that Coventry should have the precedence; that they should choose the bishop alternately; and that they should both make one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> to the bishop, in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> of Coventry should be the chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>. Matters <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> thus till the Reformation, when the priory of Coventry being dissolved by King Henry VIII., the style of the bishop continued as before. But an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of parliament passed 33d of King Henry VIII., to make the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAN\">dean</a> and chapter of Lichfield one sole chapter to the bishop. This see hath given three saints to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>; and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> one lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a>, three lord treasurers, three presidents of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, one chancellor to the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the wardrobe. The old church built by King Offa being taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by Roger de Clinton, the 37th bishop, he built the beautiful fabric that now stands in 1148, and dedicated it to the Virgin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> and St Chad. During the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> rebellion, the church suffered much; but soon after the Reformation, it was repaired and beautified. This diocese contains the whole counties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFFORD\">Stafford</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DERBY\">Derby</a> (except two parishes of the former), the largest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Warwickshire, and nearly one half of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHROPSHIRE\">Shropshire</a>, in which are 555 parishes, of which 250 are inappropriate.

His father, who was a grocer, dying before he was born, his mother procured him to be admitted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s scholar at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a>. His first inclination to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> arose on his lighting on Spenser's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAIRY\">Fairy</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a>, when he was but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> able to read; and this inclination so far improved in him, that at 13 he began to write several poems; a collection of which was published in 1613, when he was but 15. He has been represented as possessed of so bad a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> that his teachers could never bring him to retain the ordinary rules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a>. But the fact was, as Dr Johnson notices, not that he could not learn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> retain the rules; but that being able to perform his exercises without them, he spared himself the labour. In 1636 he was elected a scholar of Trinity <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, and removed to that university. Here he went through all his exercises with a remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of reputation; and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> must have pursued his poetical turn with great eagerness, as it appears that the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his poems were written before he left that university. He had taken his degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of arts before 1643, when, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the turbulence of the times, he, among others, was ejected from the college; whereupon, retiring to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, he entered himself of St John's College; and that very year, under the denomination of a scholar of Oxford, published a satire called the Puritan and the Papist. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>, however, that he did not remain very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> at Oxford; for his zeal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> cause engaging him in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of the king, who was very lenient of his abilities, and by whom he was frequently employed, he attended his majesty in many of his journeys and expeditions, and gained not only that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>'s esteem, but that of many other great personages, and in particular of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALKLAND\">Falkland</a>, one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> secretaries of state.\n\nDuring the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, he was settled in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of St Albans's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>; and when the queen-mother was obliged to retire into France, he accompanied her thither, laboured strenuously in the affairs of the royal family, undertook several very dangerous journeys on their account, and was the principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> in maintaining an epistolary correspondence between the king and queen, whose letters he ciphered and deciphered with his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. His poems, entitled The Mistres, were published at London in 1647; and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMEDY\">comedy</a> called The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">Guardian</a>, afterwards altered and published under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTER\">Cutter</a> of Coleman-street, in 1650. In 1656 it was thought proper by those on whom Mr Cowley depended that he should come over into England, and, under pretence of privacy and retirement, should give notice of the posture of affairs in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>. Upon his return he published a new edition of all his poems, consisting of four parts; viz. I. Miscellanies. II. The Mistres, or Several Copies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">Love</a>-letters. III. Pindaric Odes, written in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the style and manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PINDAR\">Pindar</a>, IV. Davidis, a sacred poem of the troubles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>, in four books.\n\nSoon after his arrival, however, he was seized, in the search after another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> in the king's party; but although it was through mistake that he was taken, yet when the republicans found all their attempts of every kind to bring him over to their party proved ineffectual, he was committed to a severe confinement, and it was even with considerable difficulty that he obtained his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>; when, venturing back to France, he remained there, in his former situation, till near the time of the king's return. During his stay in England he wrote his Two Books of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">Plants</a>, published first in 1662; to which he afterwards added four books more; and all fix, together with his other Latin poems, were printed at London in 1678. It appears by Mr Wood's Fasti Oxonienses, that our poet was created <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> of physic at Oxford, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 2. 1657.\n\nSoon after the Restoration he became possessed of a very competent estate, through the favour of his principal friends the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUCKINGHAM\">Buckingham</a> and the earl of St Albans; and being now upwards of 40 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, he took up a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> the remainder of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> which had been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of tempest and tumult, in that situation which had ever been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his wishes, a studious retirement. His eagerness to get out of the bustle of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> made him less careful than he might have been in the choice of a healthful habitation in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; by which means he found his solitude from the very beginning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> less with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of his body than with his mind. His first rural residence was at Barn Elms, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> which, lying low, and being near a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> river, was subject to a variety of breezes from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and liable in the winter-time to great inconvenience from the dampness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>. The consequence of this Mr Cowley too soon experienced, by being seized with a dangerous and lingering fever. On his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> from this he removed to Chertsey, a situation not much more healthy, where he had not been long before he was seized with another confining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>. Having languished under this for some months, he at length got the better of it, and seemed pretty well recovered from the bad symptoms, when one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> in the heat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> 1667, staying too long in the fields to give some directions to his labourers, he caught a most violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, which was attended with a defluxion and stoppage in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>; and for want of timely care, by treating it as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> cold, and refusing advice till it was past remedy, he departed this life on the 28th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> in that year, being the 49th of his age; and on the 3d of August following, he\nCowley was interred in Westminster-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a>, near the ashes of Chaucer, and his beloved Spenser. He was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of a very amiable character, as well as an admirable genius. King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> II. on the news of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, declared \"that Mr Cowley had not left a better man behind him in England.\" A monument was erected to his memory by George Villiers duke of Buckingham in 1675.\n\nBesides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> already mentioned, Mr Cowley wrote, among other things, A Proposition for the Advancement of Experimental Philolophy; A Discourse by way of Vifion concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a> of Oliver Cromwell; and Several Discourses by way of Essays in Prose and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">Verse</a>. Mr Cowley had designed also a Discourse concerning Style, and a Review of the Principles of the Primitive Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a>, but was prevented by death. A spurious piece, entitled The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">Iron</a> Age, was published under Mr Cowley's name during his absence; and, in Mr Dryden's Miscellany Poems, we find A Poem on the Civil War, said to be written by our author, but not extant in any edition of his works. An edition of his works was published by Dr Spratt, afterwards bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROCHESTER\">Rochester</a>, who also prefixed to it an account of the author's life. The reverend editor mentions, as very excellent of their kind, Mr Cowley's letters to his Friends; none of which, however, were published.\n\nThe moral character of Mr Cowley appears, from every account of it, to have been very excellent. \"He is represented by Dr Spratt (says Dr Johnson), as the most amiable of mankind; and this posthumous praise may be safely credited, as it has never been contradicted by envy or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a>.\"\n\nAs a poet, his merits have been variously estimated. Lord Clarendon has said he made a flight above all men; Addison, in his account of the English poets, that he improved upon the Theban bard; the duke of Buckingham upon his tombstone, that he was the English Pindar, the Horace, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>, the delight, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of his times. And with respect to the harshness of his numbers, the eloquent Spratt tells us, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> his verses in some places seem not as soft and flowing as one would have them, it was his choice and not his fault.\n\n\"Such (says Mr Knox) is the applause lavished on a writer who is now seldom read. That he could ever be esteemed as a pindaric poet is a curious literary phenomenon. He totally mistook his own genius when he thought of imitating Pindar. He totally mistook the genius of Pindar, when he thought his own incoherent sentiments and numbers bore the least resemblance to the wild yet regular sublimity of the Theban. He neglected even those forms, thestrophe, antistrophe, and epode, which even imitative dulness can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a>. Sublime imagery, vehement pathos, poetic fire, which constitute the essence of the Pindaric ode, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with witty conceits, accurate antitheses and vulgar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>. All these imply the coolness of deliberate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, or the meanness of a little mind; both of them most repugnant to the truly Pindaric ode, in which all is rapturous and noble. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">Wit</a> of any kind would be improperly displayed in such composition; but to increase the absurdity, the wit of Cowley is often false. That he had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for Latin poetry, and wrote in it with elegance, the well known epitaph on himself, upon his retirement, and an admirable imitation of Horace, are full proofs. But surely his rhetorical biographer makes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> hyperbole, when he affirms that Cowley has excelled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> themselves. He was inferior to many a writer of less name in the Musae Anglicane. But still he had great merit; and I must confess I have read his Latin verses with more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> than any of his English can afford.\" Essays, vol. ii. p. 363\u2014365.\n\nTo Cowley's compositions in prose Mr Knox hath paid a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> testimony. He says, that in this department he is an elegant, a pleasing, a judicious writer; and that it is much to be lamented that he did not devote a greater part of his time to a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> which appeared <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to him, and in which he excelled.\n\nDr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Warton observes, that it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> caricature of Cowley to represent him as being possessed of a strained affectation of striving to be witty upon all occasions. \"It is painful (adds this excellent critic), to censure a writer of so amiable a mind, such integrity of manners, and such sweetness of temper. His fancy was brilliant, strong, and sprightly; but his taste false and unclassical, even though he had much learning.\"\n\nDr Beattie has characterized Cowley in the following terms. \"I know not whether any nation ever produced a more singular genius than Cowley. He abounds in tender thoughts, beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, and emphatical expressions. His wit is inexhaustible, and his learning extensive; but his taste is generally barbarous, and seems to have been formed upon such models as Donne, Martial, and the worst parts of Ovid: nor is it possible to read his longer poems with pleasure, while we retain any relish for the simplicity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> composition. If this author's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> had been fewer, his conceits would have been less frequent; so that in one respect learning may be said to have hurt his genius. Yet it does not appear that Greek and Latin did him any harm; for his imitations of Anacreon are almost the only parts of him that are now remembered or read. His Davideis, and his translations of Pindar, are destitute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>, simplicity, and every other classical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a>.\"\n\nBut the works of this celebrated poet have been nowhere so amply criticized as in his Life by Dr Johnson. After a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the different pieces, the Doctor, in taking a general review of Cowley's poetry, observes, that he wrote with abundant fertility, but negligent or unskillful selection; with much thought, but with little imagery; that he is never pathetic, and rarely sublime, but always either ingenious or learned, either acute or profound.\" Of his prose he speaks with great approbation. \"No author (says he) ever kept his verse and his prose at a greater distance from each other. His thoughts are natural, and his style has a smooth and placid equality, which has never yet obtained its due commendation. Nothing is far sought or hard laboured; but all is easy without feebleness, and familiar without grossness.\" Upon the whole, he concludes as follows: \"It may be affirmed, without any encomiastic fervour, that he brought to his poetical labours a mind replete with learning, and that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> are embellished.\nlished with all the ornaments which books could supply; that he was the first who imparted to English numbers the enthusiasm of the greater ode and the gaiety of the less; that he was qualified for sprightly fancies and for lofty flights: that he was among those who freed translation from servility, and, instead of following his author at a distance, walked by his side; and that though he had left versification yet improvable, he left likewise from time to time such specimens of excellence as enabled succeeding poets to improve it.\n\nSo many of Cowley's productions being now esteemed scarcely worthy of a perusal, while others of them are distinguished by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, Dr Hurd (the present bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORCESTER\">Worcester</a>), thought proper to make a selection of them, which he published in 1772, under the title of Select Works of Mr Abraham Cowley, in two volumes; with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a> and notes by the Editor.","sp":336,"ep":338},{"h":"COWPER","t":"WILLIAM, a distinguished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> poet, was born at Berkhamstead in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HERTFORDSHIRE\">Hertfordshire</a> in the year 1732. His father, who was rector of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>, was nephew to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">Chancellor</a> Cowper. Mr Cowper was educated at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> school; and in that celebrated seminary he acquired his classical knowledge. But it would appear from his poem, entitled \"Tirocinium,\" that the impressions which he then received were not favourable to this system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>; and gave him a permanent dislike to public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>. Through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> and lucrative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of clerk to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of lords had been provided for him; he was, therefore entered at the Temple for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, in order to qualify him for it. In this situation his manners were amiable and decent; and though it is probable that he did not refuse to indulge in those pleasures which are usual among young men similarly situated, yet there seems <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> reason to suppose that he had any peculiar causes for self-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> disposition was timid and diffident; his spirits were constitutionally weak, even to the borders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> unfitness for worldly concerns; so that when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> came for assuming that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> to which he had been destined, he shrank with such terror from the idea of making his appearance before the most august <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, that, after a violent struggle with himself, he actually resigned the employment, and with it all his prospects in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. It appears to have been under the agitation of mind which this circumstance occasioned, and which threw him into a serious illness, that he was led to a deep consideration of his state in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> view; and from the system he had adopted, this course of reflection excited in him the most alarming and distressful apprehensions. In vain did his theological friends set before him those encouraging views which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTIFICATION\">justification</a> is calculated to present, and which to many is the source of a confidence perhaps as excessive as their former fears; the natural disposition of his mind fitted it to receive all the horrors, without the consolations of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>. We are told, that \"the terror of eternal judgment overpowered and wholly disordered his faculties; and he remained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> months in a continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of being instantly plunged into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> misery.\" In this shocking condition he became the subject of medical care, and he was placed in the receptacle for lunatics kept by Dr Cotton of St Albans, an amiable and worthy physician, and the author of some well known poems. At length he recovered a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of serenity; but his mind had acquired that indelible tinge of melancholy by which it was ever after characterized, and which rendered his whole life little more than a succession of intervals of comfort between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> paroxysms of settled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a>. It is unnecessary to follow him through all his scenes of retirement. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">Part</a> of his time was spent at the house of his relation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> Cowper, at Cole-green; and part at Huntingdon, with his intimate friend the reverend Mr Unwin. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of the latter, he removed with his widow to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OLNEY\">Olney</a> in Buckinghamshire, which was thenceforth the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> place of his residence. The affectionate intimacy he enjoyed with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> is strongly expressed in the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, which have probably been understood by most readers as expressive of a conjugal union:\n\n\u2014Witnes, dear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> of my walks,\nWhole arm this twentieth winter I perceive\nFast lock'd in mine, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>\nConfirm'd by long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of thy worth\nAnd well-tried virtues could alone inspire\u2014\nWitnes a joy that thou hast doubled long.\n\nTask, Book I.\n\nAt Olney he contracted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> friendship with the reverend Mr Newton, then minister there, and since rector of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> Woolnoth, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, whose religious opinions were in unison with his own. When Mr Newton published his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of Hymns, called \"The Olney's Collection,\" it was enriched with some compositions from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> of Cowper, distinguished by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> C. They bear internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of a cultivated underhanding, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> genius. His time was now wholly dedicated to that literary leisure, in which the mind, left to its own operations, follows up that line of pursuit which is the most congenial to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, and the most adapted to its powers. In his garden, in his library, and in his daily walks, he seems to have disciplined his muse to the picturesque and vivid habits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> always distinguish Cowper among our national poets. No writer, with the exception of Thomson, seems to have studied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> with more diligence, and to have copied her with more fidelity. An advantage which he has gained over other men, by his disdaining to study her \"through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECTACLES\">spectacles</a> of books,\" as Dryden calls it; and by his pursuing her through her haunts, and watching her in all her attitudes, with the eye of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> as well as of a poet. As Mr Cowper had no relish for public concerns, it was not singular that he should have neglected the study of the law, on which he had entered. That knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> life, which is so requisite for the legal profession, would hardly be acquired on the banks of the Ouse, and in silent contemplations on the beauties of nature. In this retreat, he exchanged for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSES\">muses</a>, the ambition and tumult of a forensic occupation; dedicating his mind to the cultivation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, and storing it with those images which he derived from the inexhaustible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a> of a rich and varied scenery, in a most beautiful and romantic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>.\u2014The first volume of his poems, which was published by Mr Newton in 1787, consists of\nof various pieces, on various subjects. It seems, that he had been affiduous in cultivating a turn for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> and argumentative verification, on moral and ethical topics. Of this kind is The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">Table</a> Talk, and several other pieces in the collection. He who objects to these poems as containing too great a neglect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> in the arrangement of his words, and the expressions too profuse, will condemn him on principles of criticism which are by no means <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> and style of the subject be considered. Horace apologized for the style of his own satires, which are, strictly speaking, only ethical and moral discourses, by observing, that those topics required the pedellion and familiar diction, and a form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, not carried to the heights of poetry. But if the reader will forego the delight of smooth verification, and recollect that poetry does not altogether consist in even and polished metre, he will remark in these productions, no ordinary depth of thinking and of judgment, upon the most important objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> intercourse; and he will be occasionally struck with lines, not unworthy of Dryden for their strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> poems are well known. Of these, the verses supposed to be written by Alex. Selkirk, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Juan Fernandez, are in the most popular estimation. There is great originality in the following stanza.\n\nI am out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>'s reach;\nI must finish my journey alone;\nNever hear the sweet music of speech;\nI start at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> of my own.\"\n\nIt would be absurd to give one general character of the pieces, that were published in this volume: yet, this is true concerning Mr Cowper's productions; that in all the varieties of his style, there may still be discerned the likeness and impressiveness of the same mind; the same unaffected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a>, which always rejects unreasonable ambitions and ornaments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>; the same easy vigour; the same serene and cheerful hope, derived from a steady and unshaken faith in the dogmas of Christianity. Mr Cowper, perhaps, does not derive praise from the choice and elegance of his words; but he has the higher praise of having chosen them without affectation. He appears to have used them as he found them; neither introducing fallacious refinements nor adhering to obsolete barbarisms. He understood the whole science of numbers, and he practised their different kinds with considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>; and, if his verses do not flow so softly as the delicacy of a modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> requires, that roughness, which is objected to in his poetry, is his choice, not his defect. But this sort of critics, who admire only what is exquisitely polished, like Cuyp's pictures, these lovers of \"gentle nefs without finesse,\" ought to take into their estimate, that vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of thought which is so abundantly poured over the writings of Cowper, without which human discourse is only an idle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of sounds and syllables. The favourable reception which this volume experienced, produced another of superior merit. His principal performance was undoubtedly \"The Talk,\" a poem. The occasion that gave birth to it was trivial. A lady had requested him to write a piece in blank <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>, and gave him for its subject a thing next to her, viz. the sofa. This he expanded into one of the finest moral poems our language has produced. It is written in blank verse as desired; and Cowper, though in that respect it resembles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a>'s, it is nevertheless original and highly characteristic. It is not too flatly for familiar description, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> too depressed for sublime and elevated imagery. If it has any fault, it is that of being too much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with idiomatic expression; a fault which the author, in the rapidity with which his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> and his utterance seem to have flowed, very naturally incurred. In this poem, his fancy ran with the most exquisite freedom. The poet enlarges upon his topics, and confirms his argument by every variety of illustration. He never however dwells upon them too long, and leaves off in such a manner, that it seems it was in his power to have said more. The arguments of the poem are various. The works of nature, the associations with which they exhibit themselves, the designs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a>, and the passions of men. Of one advantage, the writer has amply availed himself. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> not being rigidly confined to any precise subject, he has indulged himself in all the laxity and freedom of a miscellaneous poem. Yet he has still adhered so faithfully to the general laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGRUITY\">congruity</a>, that whether he inspires the softer affections into his reader, or delights him with keen and playful raillery, or discourses on the ordinary manners of human nature, or holds up the bright pictures of religious consolation to his mind, he adopts, at pleasure, a diction just and appropriate, equal in elevation to the sacred effusions of pious rapture, and sufficiently easy and familiar for descriptions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> life; skilful alike in soaring without effort, and descending without meanness. He who desires to put into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of youth a poem, which not destitute of poetic embellishment, is free from all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of a licentious tendency, will find in the Talk a book adapted to his purpose. It would be absurd and extravagant audacity to condemn those poetical productions in which love constitutes the leading feature. That <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> has in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> been the concernment of life, the theme of the poet, the plot of the stage. Yet there is a kind of amorous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>, bordering on morbid enthusiasm, which the youthful mind too often imbibes from the glowing sentiments of the poets. Their genius describes, in the most splendid colours, the operations of a passion which requires rebuke rather than incentive, and lends to the most grovelling sensuality, the enchantments of a rich and creative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>. But in the Talk of Cowper, there is no licentiousness of description. All is grave, majestic, and moral. A vein of sober thinking pervades every page, and, in finished poetry, describes the insufficiency and vanity of human pursuits. Not that he is always severe. He frequently enlivens the mind of his reader by sportive descriptions, and by representing in elevated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, ludicrous objects and circumstances, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of the mock heroic, so admired in Phillipp's Splendid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHILLING\">Shilling</a>. The historical account he has given of chairs, in the first book of the Talk, is a striking specimen of his powers of verification, and of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> in this latter style. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> is however the most detained by those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>, in which the charms of rural life, and the endearments of domestic retirement are described. The Talk abounds with incidents, introduced as episodes, and interposing an agreeable relief to the grave and serious part of the poetry. His\nCrazy Kate is a description of the calamity of a disordered reason, admirably exact and affecting.\n\n\"She begs an idle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> of all the meets.\"\n\nWhat poet would have introduced so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> a circumstance into his representation! and yet that minuteness constitutes its happy effect.\n\nOf his talent for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> there cannot be a better specimen than his sketch of the melancholy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, probably sketched from what too faithful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> suggested of himself:\n\nLook where he comes\u2014In this embower'd alcove\nStand clofe concealed, and see a statue move;\nLips <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a>, and eyes fixt, foot falling slow,\nArms hanging idly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, hands clasped below,\nInterpret to the marking eye, distress,\nSuch as its symptoms only can express.\nThat tongue is silent now\u2014that silent tongue\nCould argue once, could jeft or join the song,\nCould give advice, could censure or commend,\nOr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a> the sorrows of a drooping friend.\nRenounc'd alike its office and its sport,\nIts brisker and its graver strains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> short;\nBoth fall beneath a fever's secret sway,\nAnd like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> brook are past away.\n\nRetirement.\n\nHis John Gilpin is universally known, and may be considered as a sporting piece of humour, which would have done <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to many writers, but can hardly be said to have added to Mr Cowper's reputation. His next work was a translation of the Iliad and Odyssey into Miltonic blank verse. It is an unjust piece of criticism to compare the version of Mr Pope to that of Mr Cowper. The merits of each are distinct and appropriate. Mr Pope has exhibited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a> as he would have sung had he been born in England. Mr Cowper has endeavoured to portray him, as he wrote in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, adhering frequently to the peculiarities of his original's idiom, and desiring to preserve his strength and energy, together with his harmony and smoothness. Mr Cowper died of a fever and lingering illness, at East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEREHAM\">Dereham</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORFOLK\">Norfolk</a>, April 25, 1800.","sp":338,"ep":340},{"h":"COX","t":"RICHARD, a learned prelate, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> pillar of the Reformation, was born at Whaddon in Buckinghamshire, of low parentage, in the year 1499. From Eaton school he obtained a scholarship in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, of which he became a fellow in 1519; he was thence invited to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Wolsey, and was there made one of the junior canons of Cardinal college. In 1525 he was incorporated bachelor; and the following year took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of arts in the same university. In this situation he became remarkable for his learning and poetical abilities; but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to the opinions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a> rendered him hateful to his superiors, who stripped him of his preferment, and threw him into prison on a suspicion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a>. Being, however, soon released, he was chosen master of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETON\">Eton</a> school, which flourished remarkably under his care. In 1537 he commenced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> at Cambridge; in 1540 was made archdeacon of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELY\">Ely</a>; and the following year prebendary of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a>, on its being new founded by King Henry VIII. In 1546 he was made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAN\">dean</a> of Christ-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, Oxford. By the recommendation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">Archbishop</a> Cranmer and Bishop Goodrich, to the latter of whom he had been chaplain, he not only obtained the above preferments, but was chosen preceptor to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> Edward, on whose accession to the throne he became a favourite at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, was sworn of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-PRIVY_COUNCIL\">privy <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, and made king's almoner. In 1547 he was elected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> of Oxford; in 1548 canon of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINDSOR\">Windsor</a>; and the next year dean of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a>. About this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he was appointed one of the commissioners to visit the university of Oxford; in which office his zeal for reformation was so excessive, that he destroyed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of curious and valuable books, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> better reason than because they were written by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMAN_CATHOLICS\">Roman Catholics</a>. On the accession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> he was stripped of all his preferments and committed to the Marshalsea. He was, however, soon released, and immediately left the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. Having resided some time at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STRASBOURG\">Strasbourg</a> with his intimate friend <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARTYR\">Martyr</a>, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Queen Mary he returned to England, and, with other divines, was appointed to revive the liturgy. He often preached before the queen; and in 1559 was preferred to the see of Ely, which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to enjoy upwards of 21 years. He was, however, no favourite with the queen; the reason assigned for which was, his zealous opposition to her retaining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRUCIFIX\">crucifix</a> and wax-candles on the altar of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> chapel; also his strenuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> of the clergy, which her majesty always disapproved. He died on the 22d of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1581, aged 81. He was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of considerable learning, a zealous and rigid bulwark of the church of England, and an implacable enemy both to Papists and Puritans. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Archbishop Parker, he advises him to proceed vigorously in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RECLAIMING\">reclaiming</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> punishing the Puritans, and not to be discouraged at the frown of those court-favourites who protected them; assuring him that he might expect the blessing of God on his pious labours to free the church from their dangerous attempts, and to establish uniformity. This zealous reformer we find had not totally lost sight of the Popish texts, compel them to come in; but a stronger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of his implacability and self-importance appears in his letter to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a> Burleigh, in which he warmly expostulates with the council for interfering in behalf of the Puritans, or meddling in affairs of the church, admonishing them to keep their own sphere. Such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> from a bishop would make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> privy council stare. His works are, 1. Two Latin Orations on the Dispute between Dr Tresham and Peter Martyr, Lond. 1549, 4to. 2.

Its whole circumference does not exceed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> miles; and off its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-eastern extremity is a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> forming a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Cook anchored when visiting this island on his last voyage. On the southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the small island is a reef of rocks, within which is a tolerable shelter against all northerly winds, there being 27 fathoms <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> in the mid channel, and 18 near the reef. Between the two islands there is a narrow passage for boats. The shore that constitutes the west side of the road runs in a north-westery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, having a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of coral running into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> for a little way, so that it is difficult for boats to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> except at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> water; but the anchoring ground is very good and free from rocks. In the inland parts the ground is elevated, rising on all sides gradually from the sea, and is entirely covered with wood, excepting a few spots which are cleared by the inhabitants for sowing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> is reckoned very healthy in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with the neighbouring countries, but it is very thinly inhabited.

It was formerly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of Poland, where the kings were elected and crowned, and was once almost the centre of the Polish dominions, but is now a frontier town; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> how much the power of this republic has been contracted.\n\nCrackow stands in an extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, watered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VISTULA\">Vistula</a>, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> but shallow: the city and its suburbs occupy a vast tract of ground, but are so badly peopled, that they scarcely contain 16,000 inhabitants. The great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> in the middle of the town is very spacious, and has several well-built houses, once richly furnished and well inhabited, but most of them now either untenanted or in a state of melancholy decay. Many of the streets are broad and handsome; but almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> bears the most striking marks of ruined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>: the churches alone seem to have preserved their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> splendour. The devastation of this unfortunate town was begun by the Swedes at the commencement of the present century, when it was besieged and taken by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> XII. but\nCrackow, the mischiefs it suffered from that ravager of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> were far less destructive than those it experienced during the late dreadful commotions, when it underwent repeated sieges, and was alternately in possession of the Russians and Confederates. The effects of cannon, grape, and musket <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a>, are still discernible on the walls and houses. In a word, Crackow exhibits the remains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> magnificence, and looks like a great capital in ruins: from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of fallen and falling houses one would imagine it had lately been sacked, and that the enemy had left it only yesterday. The town is surrounded with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> walls of brick, strengthened by round and square towers of whimsical shapes, in the ancient style of fortification: these walls were built by Venceslaus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a> during the short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> in which he reigned over Poland.\n\nThe university of Crackow was formerly, and not unjustly, called the mother of Polish literature, as it principally supplied the other seminaries with professors and men of learning; but its lustre has been greatly obscured by the removal of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> residence to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARSAW\">Warsaw</a>, and still more by the late intestine convulsions. In this city the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> was first introduced into Poland by Haller; and one of the earliest books was the Constitutions and Statutes compiled by Casimir the Great, and afterwards augmented by his successors. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> are Gothic, the same which were universally used at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of printing: the great initial letters are wanting, which shows that they were probably painted and afterwards worn away. The year in which this compilation was printed is not positively known; but its publication was certainly anterior to 1496, as it does not contain the statutes passed by John Albert in that year. The most flourishing period of the university was under Sigismund Augustus in the 16th century, when several of the German reformers fled from the persecutions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Charles V. and found an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a> in this city. They gave to the world several versions of the sacred writings, and other theological publications, which diffused the reformed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> over great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Poland. The protection which Sigismund Augustus afforded to men of learning of all denominations, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> toleration which he extended to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, created a suspicion that he was secretly inclined to the new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>; and it was even reported that he intended to renounce the Catholic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, and publicly profess the reformed religion.\n\nTowards the southern part of the town, near the Vistula, rises a small eminence or rock, upon the top of which is built the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, surrounded with brick walls and old towers, which form a kind of citadel to the town. This palace owes its origin to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADISLAUS\">Ladislaus</a> Jagiellon; but little of the ancient structure now appears, as the greatest part was demolished by Charles XII. in 1701, when he entered this town in triumph after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Klipow. It has been since repaired. The remains of the old palace consist of a few apartments, which are left in their ancient state as they existed in the last century. This palace was formerly the residence of the kings of Poland, who, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of Ladislaus Locketec, have been crowned at Crackow. The Polish and German historians differ concerning the time when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of king was first claimed by the sovereigns of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; but the most probable account is, according to Mr Coxe, that in 1295 Premillas assumed the regal title, and was inaugurated at Gnefna by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a>. He was succeeded by Ladislaus Locketec, who offending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">Poles</a> by his capricious and tyrannical conduct, was deposed before he was crowned; and Venceslaus king of Bohemia, who had married Richa <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Premillas, being elected in his stead, was in 1300 consecrated at Gnefna. Ladislaus, after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> from his country and undergoing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of calamitous adventures, was at length brought to a penit of his misconduct. Having regained the affection of his subjects, he was restored, in the lifetime of Venceslaus, to part of his dominions; and he recovered them all upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMISE\">demise</a> of that monarch in the year 1305: he governed, however, for some years without the title of king; but at length in 1320 was crowned at Crackow, to which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> he transferred the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> of the coronation; and afterwards enacted, that for the future his successors should be inaugurated in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> of this city.\n\nSince that period all the sovereigns have been consecrated at Crackow, excepting the last king. Previous to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> was issued by the diet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVOCATION\">convocation</a>, that the coronation should be solemnized for this turn at Warsaw, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> in future to the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of Crackow; a proviso calculated to satisfy the populace, but which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not probably prevent any future sovereign from being crowned at Warsaw, now become the capital of Poland and the residence of its kings. The diadem and other regalia used at the coronation are still kept in the palace of Crackow, under so many keys, and with such care, that it was impossible to obtain a sight of them.\n\nAdjoining to the palace stands the cathedral, also within the walls of the citadel. Here all the sovereigns, from the time of Ladislaus Locketec, have been interred, a few only excepted, viz. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> and Ladislaus II. who were kings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUNGARY\">Hungary</a> as well as of Poland, and whose bodies were deposited in Hungary; Alexander, who died and was buried at Vilna; Henry of Valois, interred in France; and the late monarch Augustus III. The sepulchres of the kings of Poland are not distinguished by any peculiar magnificence; their figures are carved in marble of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> extraordinary workmanship, and some are without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSCRIPTIONS\">inscriptions</a>.\n\nThe bishop of Crackow is the first in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Saveria, and very often a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">cardinal</a>.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> being at Cambridge, he retired to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of a relation at Waltham <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">Abbey</a>, where, meeting with Fox the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s almoner, and Gardiner the secretary, he gave his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> concerning King Henry's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> with Catherine much to the satisfaction of his majesty. This opinion was, that instead of disputing about the validity of the king's marriage with Catherine, they should reduce the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> to this simple question, \"Whether a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> may marry his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>'s wife <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> not?\" When the king was told of it he said, \"This fellow has got the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> low by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>.\" He then sent for him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, made him one of his chaplains, and ordered him to write in vindication of the divorce in agitation. This book having quieted the tender <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> of the king, he was desirous that all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> should be convinced of the illegality of his marriage with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> Catherine; and for that purpose sent Cranmer to France, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, and Germany, to dispute the matter with the divines of those countries. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUREMBERG\">Nuremberg</a> Cranmer married a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> wife. Being returned to England, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1533 he was consecrated archbishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTERBURY\">Canterbury</a>; in May following he pronounced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> of divorce between the king and queen; and soon after married the amorous monarch to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANN\">Ann</a> Boleyn. Being now at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, he exerted himself in the business of the Reformation. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a> was translated into English, and monasteries dissolved principally by his means.\n\nIn 1536 the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> conscience again required the affiance\nCranmer, instance of our archbishop; in this year he divorced the king from Ann Boleyn. In 1537 he visited his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a>, and endeavoured to abolish the superstitious observation of holidays. In 1539 he and some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> fell under the king's displeasure, because they could not be brought to give their consent in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> that the monasteries should be suppressed for the king's sole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. He also strenuously opposed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> for the six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> in the house of lords, speaking three days against it; and upon the passing of that statute sent away his wife into Germany. In 1540 he was one of the commissioners for inspecting into matters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, and explaining some of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> doctrines. The result of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> was the book entitled A necessary Erudition of any Christian man. After <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Cromwell's death (in whose behalf he had written to the king), he retired and lived in great privacy, meddling not at all with state affairs. In 1541 he gave orders pursuant to the king's directions, for taking away superstitious shrines; and exchanging Bishopsham for Beckenham, united the latter to his diocese. In 1542 he procured the \"Act for the advancement of true religion and the abolishment of the contrary,\" which moderated the rigour of the six articles. But the year following, some enemies preferring accusations against him, he had like to have been ruined, had not the king interposed in his behalf. His majesty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> afterwards to protect him from his enemies; and at his death appointed him one of the executors of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, and one of the regents of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. In 1556 he crowned young Edward, during whose short reign he promoted the reformation to the utmost of his power; and was particularly instrumental in composing, correcting, and establishing the liturgy by act of parliament. He had also a share in compiling the thirty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> articles of religion.\n\nIn 1553 he opposed the new settlement of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a> Jane Grey, and would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> way be concerned in that affair (though at last, through many opportunities, he was prevailed upon to set his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> to it); neither would he join in any of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUDLEY\">Dudley</a>'s ambitious projects. Upon Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>'s accession to the throne, he was committed to the Tower; partly for setting his hand to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of Lady Jane's succession, and partly for the public offer he had made a little before of justifying openly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> proceedings of the late king. Some of his friends, foreseeing the storm that was likely to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> upon him, advised him to fly, but he absolutely refused. In the ensuing parliament, on November the 3rd, he was attainted, and at Guildhall found guilty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a>; whereupon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of his archbishopric were sequestrated. In April 1554, he and Ridley and Latimer were removed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, in order for a public disputation with the Papists; which was accordingly held there towards the middle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, with great noise, triumph, and impudent confidence on the Papists' side, and with as much gravity, learning, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a>, and convincing sufficiency on the side of the Protestant bishops. The 20th of April, two days after the end of these disputations, Cranmer and the two others were brought before the commissioners, and asked, Whether they would subscribe (to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPERY\">Popery</a>)? which they unanimously refusing, were condemned as heretics. From this sentence the archbishop appealed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> judgment of the Almighty; and wrote to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, giving them an account of the Cranmer disputation, and desiring the queen's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> for his treason, which it seems was not yet remitted. By the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVOCATION\">convocation</a> which met this year, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">Defence</a> of the true and Catholic Doctrine of the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ was ordered to be burnt. Some of his friends petitioned the queen in his behalf; putting her in mind how he had once preserved her in her father's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> intercessions with him for her, so that she had reason to believe he loved her, and would speak the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> to her more than all the rest of the clergy. All endeavours in his behalf, however, were ineffectual; and the archbishop being degraded and most ignominiously treated, was at last flattered and terrified into an insincere recantation and renunciation of the Protestant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>. But this triumph was not sufficient to gratify the pious vengeance of the Roman Mary. On the 24th of Feb. 1556, a writ was signed for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> of Cranmer; and on the 24th March, which was the fatal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, he was brought to St Mary's church, Oxford, and placed on a kind of stage over against the pulpit, where Dr Cole, provost of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETON\">Eton</a>, was appointed to preach a sermon on the occasion. While Cole was haranguing, the unfortunate Cranmer expressed great inward confusion; often lifting up his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> and eyes to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, and frequently pouring out floods of tears. At the end of the sermon, when Cole desired him to make an open profession of his faith, as he had promised him he would, he first prayed in the most fervent manner; then made an exhortation to the people present, not to set their minds upon the world, to obey the king and queen, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> each other, and to be charitable. After this he made a confession of his faith, beginning with the creed, and concluding with these words:\n\n\"And I believe every word and sentence taught by our Saviour Jesus Christ, his apostles, and prophets, in the Old and New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>.\u2014And now (added he) I come to the great thing that so much troubleth my conscience, more than any thing I ever did or said in my whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; and that is the setting abroad a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> contrary to the truth, which I here now renounce as things written with my hand contrary to the truth which I thought in my heart; and written for fear of death, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> my life <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it might be: that is, all such bills and papers which I have written or signed with my hand since my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a>, wherein I have written many things untrue. And forasmuch as my hand offended, writing contrary to my heart, my hand shall first be punished; for, may I come to the fire, it shall be first burned. As for the pope, I refuse him as Christ's enemy and antichrist, with all his false doctrine. And as for the sacrament, I believe as I have taught in my book against the bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINCHESTER\">Winchester</a>.\" Thunderstruck as it were with this unexpected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a>, the enraged Papish crowd admonished him not to dissemble. \"Ah!\" (replied he with tears) since I lived hitherto, I have been a hater of falsehood and a lover of simplicity, and never before this time have I dissembled.\" Whereupon they pulled him off the stage with the utmost fury, and hurried him to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of his martyrdom over against Baliol college; where he put off his clothes in haste, and standing in his shirt, and without shoes, was fastened with a chain to the stake. Some pressing him to agree to his former recantation, he\nCranmer, he answered, showing his hand, \"This is the hand that wrote it, and therefore it shall first suffer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>.\" Fire being applied to him, he stretched out his right hand into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>, and held it there unmoved (except that once with it he wiped his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>) till it was consumed; crying with a loud <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, \"This hand hath offended;\" and often repeating, \"This unworthy right hand.\" At last the fire getting up, he soon expired, never stirring or crying out all the while; only keeping his eyes fixed to heaven, and repeating more than once, \"Lord Jesus receive my spirit.\" Such was the end of the renowned Thomas Cranmer, in the 67th year of his age.\n\nIt was noticed above, that after the passing of the act for the six articles, Archbishop Cranmer sent his wife into Germany. But after returned again to England; and Mr Strype informs us that \"in the time of King Edward, when the marriage of the clergy was allowed, he brought her forth, and lived openly with her.\" Mr Gilpin says, \"he left behind him a widow and children; but as he always kept his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> in obscurity for prudential reasons, we know little about them. They had been kindly provided for by Henry VIII.; who, without any solicitation from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMATE\">primate</a> himself, gave him a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> from the abbey of Walbeck in Nottinghamshire, which his family enjoyed after his decease. King Edward made some addition to his private fortune; and his heirs were restored in blood by an act of parliament in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>.\n\nArchbishop Cranmer wrote a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of books; many of them he published himself; and many of them still remain in MSS. viz. two folio volumes in the king's library, several letters in the Cotton collection, &c.\n\nMr Gilpin remarks, That \"the character of the archbishop hath been equally the subject of exaggerated praise and of undeserved censure.\" The most indefensible parts of the archbishop's character are the readings with which he sometimes concurred in the unjustifiable proceedings of Henry VIII. and the instances wherein he showed himself to be actuated by intolerant principles.\n\n\"He first recommended himself to Henry by the zeal which he displayed in promoting the king's divorce from Queen Catherine. As to this, it may be allowed, that Dr Cranmer might think the marriage wrong; but though it possibly might be a point of conscience with the king, it could however be none with him; and there was manifestly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between advising not to do a thing, and advising to undo it when already done, at least in a matter of so disputable a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. On the other hand, to repudiate a woman with whom the king had cohabited near 20 years as his wife, and to illegitimate a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>, bred up in the highest expectations, and now marriageable, were acts of such cruelty, that it seems to indicate a want of feeling to be in any degree <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCESSORY\">accessory</a> to them. To this may be added, that the notoriety of the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for Ann Boleyn, which all men believed to be, if not the first mover, at least the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> of his pretended scruples, threw a very indelicate imputation on all who had any concern in the affair. No serious churchman, one would imagine, could be fond of the idea of administering to the king's passions. It is with concern, therefore, that we see a man of Dr Cranmer's integrity and simplicity of manners acting so much out of character as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> an affair of this kind, if not with his conscience, at least with all delicacy of sentiment; and to parade through Europe, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a>, defending everywhere the king's pious intentions. But the cause (continues Mr Gilpin) animated him. With the illegality of the king's marriage, he endeavoured virtually to establish the insufficiency of the pope's dispensation; and the latter was an argument so near his heart, that it seems to have added merit to the former. We cannot indeed account for his embarking so zealously in this business without supposing his principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> was to free his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> from the tyranny of Rome; to which this step very evidently led. So desirable an end would in some degree, he might imagine, sanctify the means.\"\n\nOf two of the instances of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a> in which Archbishop Cranmer was concerned, Mr Gilpin gives the following account. \"Juan Bocher and George <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> were accused, though at different times; one for denying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> of Christ, the other for denying his divinity. They were both tried and condemned to the stake; and the archbishop not only consented to these acts of blood, but even persuaded the aversion of the young king into a compliance. 'Your majesty must distinguish (said he, informing his royal pupil's conscience) between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> opinions and such as are the essential articles of faith. These latter we must on no account suffer to be opposed.' Mr Gilpin justly observes, that 'nothing even plausible can be suggested in defence of the archbishop on this occasion, except only that the spirit of Popery was not yet wholly repressed.'\"\n\nThese instances of injustice and barbarity were indeed totally indefensible, and a great disgrace to Cranmer and to all who were concerned in them. It does not appear that he endeavoured to promote the death of Lambert; but, as Mr Gilpin observes, it were to be wished he had rid his hand of the disputation likewise. The public disputation, in which Cranmer bore some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>, proved the means of bringing Lambert to the stake.\n\nOne of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> transactions of Archbishop Cranmer's life, was the firm stand that he made against the act of the six articles. This act was so strongly supported by the king, that even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a> in parliament made little opposition to it. But Cranmer opposed it with great zeal and readiness. \"The good archbishop (says Mr Gilpin) never appeared in a more truly Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> than on this occasion. In the midst of so general a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFECTION\">defection</a> (for there were numbers in the house who had hitherto shown great forwardness in reformation) he alone made a stand. Three days he maintained his ground, and baffled the arguments of all opposers. But argument was not their weapon, and the archbishop <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> himself obliged to sink under superior power. He may ordered him to leave the house. The primate refused: 'It was God's business (he said), and not man's. And when he could do no more, he boldly entered his protest. Such an instance of fortitude is sufficient to wipe off many of those courtly stains which have fallen on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>.'\n\nHis behaviour in the cause of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORFOLK\">Norfolk</a> was also entitled to great commendation. \"The last\nCranmer's act of this reign (says Mr Gilpin) was an act of blood, and gave the archbishop a noble opportunity of showing how well he had learned that great Christian lesson of forgiving an enemy. Almost without the shadow of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, Henry had given directions to have the duke of Norfolk attainted by an act of parliament. The king's mandate stood in lieu of guilt, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> passed the house with great ease. No man, except the bishop of Winchester, had been so great an enemy to the archbishop as the duke of Norfolk. He had always thwarted the primate's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, and often than once had practised against his life. How many would have seen with secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> the workings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a> against so rancorous an enemy? satisfied in having themselves no hand in his unjust fate! But the archbishop saw the affair in another light: he saw it with horror; and although the king had in a particular manner interested himself in this business, the primate opposed the bill with all his might; and when his opposition was vain, he left the house with indignation, and retired to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROYDON\">Croydon</a>.\n\nHe was indeed remarkable for the placability of his temper, and for showing kindness to those by whom he had been greatly injured. Hence it is mentioned in Shakespeare's Henry VIII. as a common saying concerning him:\n\n\"Do my lord of Canterbury\nBut one shrewd turn, and he's your friend for ever.\"\n\nArchbishop Cranmer was a great friend and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of learned foreigners, who had been persecuted for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to the principles of the reformation. Mr Gilpin says, \"the suffering professors of Protestantism, who were scattered in great numbers about the various countries of Europe, were always sure of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a> with him. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> at Lambeth might be called a seminary of learned men; the greater part of whom persecution had driven from home. Here, among other celebrated reformers, Martyr, Bucer, Ales, Phage, found sanctuary. Martyr, Bucer, and Phage, were liberally pensioned by the archbishop till he could otherwise provide for them. It was his wish to fix them in the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a>, where he hoped their great knowledge and spirit of inquiry would forward his designs of restoring learning; and he at length obtained professorships for them all. Bucer and Phage were settled at Cambridge; where they only showed what might have been expected from them, both dying within a few months after their arrival. But at Oxford Martyr acted a very conspicuous part, and contributed to introduce among the students there a very liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of thinking.\n\nOf the learning of Archbishop Cranmer, Mr Gilpin remarks, that \"it was chiefly confined to his profession. He had applied himself in Cambridge to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the Greek and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> languages; which though esteemed at that time as the mark of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a>, appeared to him the only sources of attaining a critical knowledge of the Scriptures. He had so accurately studied canon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, that he was esteemed the best canonist in England; and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a> was so extensive, and his collections from the Fathers so very voluminous, that there were few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> in which he was not accurately informed, and in which he could not give the opinions of the several ages of the church from the times of the apostles. He was a sensible writer, rather nervous than elegant. His writings were entirely confined to the great controversy which then subsisted, and contain the whole sum of the theological learning of those times. His library was filled with a very noble collection of books, and was open to all men of letters.\n\nMr Gilpin, after remarking that Archbishop Cranmer preached often wherever he visited, says, \"In his sermons to the people he was very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> and instructive; insisting chiefly on the essentials of Christianity. The subjects of his sermons, for the most part, were from whence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a> is to be fetched, and on whom the confidence of man ought to lean. They insisted much on doctrines of faith and works; and taught what the fruits of faith were, and what place was to be given to works; they instructed men in the duties they owed their neighbour, and that every one was our neighbour, to whom we might any way do good; they declared what men ought to think of themselves after they had done all; and, lastly, what promises Christ hath made, and who they are to whom he will make them good. Thus he brought in the true preaching of the gospel, altogether different from the ordinary way of preaching in those days; which was to treat concerning saints, to tell legendary tales of them, and to report <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a> wrought for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of transubstantiation and other popish corruptions. And such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of conviction accompanied his sermons, that the people departed from them with minds possessed of a great hatred of vice, and burning with a desire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>.\"\n\nHe was a great economist of his time. Mr Gilpin says, \"he rose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> at five o'clock and continued in his study till nine. These early hours, he would say, were the only hours he could call his own. After breakfast he generally spent the remainder of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> either in public or private business. His chapel-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> was eleven, and his dinner-hour twelve. After dinner he spent an hour either in conversation with his friends, in playing at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHESS\">chess</a>, or in, what he liked better, overlooking a chess-board. He then retired again to his study till his chapel-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELL\">bell</a> rang at five. After prayers, he generally walked till six, which was in those times the hour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>. His evening <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a> was sparing. Often he ate nothing; and when that was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, it was his usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, as he sat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, to draw on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of gloves; which was as much as to say, that his hands had nothing to do. After supper, he spent an hour in walking and another in his study, retiring to his bedchamber about nine. This was his usual mode of living when he was most vacant, but very often his afternoons as well as his mornings were engaged in business.

Delinquents were publicly rebuked, and after the third admonition discharged. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a> and charities were great and noble; equal to his station, greater often than his abilities. A plentiful table was among the virtues of those days. His was always bountifully covered. In an upper room was spread his own, where he seldom wanted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of the first distinction. Here a great many learned foreigners were daily entertained, and partook of his bounty. In his great hall a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> table was plentifully covered every day for guests and strangers of a lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>: at the upper end of which were three smaller tables, designed for his own officers and inferior gentlemen. Among other instances of the archbishop's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a>, we have one recorded which was truly noble. After the destruction of monasteries, and before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a> were erected, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> saw no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of greater misery than that of wounded and disbanded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>. For the use of such miserable objects as were landed on the southern coasts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, the archbishop fitted up his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANOR\">manor</a>-house of Beckesbourn in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a>. He formed it indeed into a complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a>; appointing a physician, a surgeon, nurses, and everything proper, as well for food as physic.

In order to propagate a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of quick, one method is generally practised; namely, first burying the haws, and taking them up to sow the October following; though, says Hanbury, there is another way more preferable; namely, to prepare the beds, and sow the haws soon after they are gathered. Whoever pursues the former method, having gathered what quantity of haws <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> answer his purpose, should in some bye-corner of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a>-garden or nursery dig a hole or pit capacious enough to receive them; some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> which came out of the hole, after the haws are put in it, should be laid upon them; and being thus carefully covered down, they may remain there till October. Then, having ground well dug, and cleared of the roots of all troublesome weeds, and the mould being fit for working, the beds should be made for the haws. Four feet is a very good width of these beds, as they may be easily reached over to be weeded; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the alleys between be each one foot and a half wide, they will be of a good size. The beds being marked out with a line, sufficient mould must be raked out to cover the haws an inch and a half deep. This being done, and the bottom of the beds being made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> and even the haws should be sown, and afterwards gently tapped down with the back of the spade; and then the fine mould, which had been raked out of the beds, must be thrown over them, covering them an inch and a half deep. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> the plants will come up, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> following should be kept clear of weeds; though it does sometimes happen, that few of them will appear till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> spring after sowing. Sometimes the young plants are planted out from the feed-beds at one, two, or three years old; but the best plants are obtained by transplanting them into fresh mould the first or second year, letting them remain in the nursery two or three years longer. The practice of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> nurserymen is this: The strongest of the feed-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> plants having been drawn at two or three years old for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>, they clear the beds entirely by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> the remaining weak underling plants, and transplanting them into fresh beds in this manner, which they call bedding them: The ground having been trenched, and the tips of the plants as well as the lower fibres of their roots having been taken off with a sharp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, they strain a line along one side of the bed; and by chopping with a spade by the side of the line, leave a cliff or drill of a depth proportioned to the length of the plants to be laid in; and drawing the loofe mould somewhat towards them, leave the side of the drill next\nto the line with a smooth polished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>. Against this face the plants are set up, leaning towards the line, about three inches asunder, leaving their heads about an inch above the mould, and placing their roots at such a depth as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> their stems from two to three inches deeper than they stood in the seed-bed. The loose mould being returned and pressed gently to the roots with the foot, the line is removed, and another row planted in the same manner about a foot from the first.","sp":348,"ep":349},{"h":"CRATCHES","t":"in the manege, a swelling on the pateform, under the fetlock, and sometimes under the hoof; for which reason it is distinguished into the finer cratches, which affect the finer, and those upon the coronet, called quitter-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>.","sp":349,"ep":349},{"h":"CRATER","t":"Cup, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a>, a constellation of the southern hemisphere; whose stars, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>'s catalogue, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a>; in Tycho's, eight; in Hevelius's ten; in the Britannic catalogue, thirty-one.\n\nCrater is also used to signify the mouth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> opening of a volcano or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> mountain, from whence the fire is discharged.

Whether the painter works with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>-colours, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>-colours, or crayons, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his pursuit is still the same: a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. But each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> has its peculiar rules and methods. Painting with crayons requires in many respects a treatment different from painting in oil-colours; because all colours used dry are in their nature of a much warmer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> than when wet with oils, &c. For this reason, in order to produce a rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>, a much greater portion of what painters <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> cooling teints must be applied in crayon painting than would be judicious to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in oils. Without any danger of a mistake, it is to be supposed, the not being acquainted with this observation is one great cause why so many oil painters have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> better success when they attempt crayon-painting. On the contrary, crayon painters being so much used to those teints which are of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> nature when used wet, are apt to introduce them too much when they paint with oils, which is seldom productive of a good effect.\n\nWe shall now endeavour to give the students some directions towards the attainment of excellence in this art.\n\nOf the Application of the Crayons, with some previous Dispositions. The student must provide himself with some strong blue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, the thicker the better, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the grain is not too coarse or knotty, though it is almost impossible to get any entirely free from knots. The knots should be levelled with a penknife or razor, otherwise they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> prove exceedingly troublesome. After this is done, the paper must be pasted very smooth on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> cloth, previously strained on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> frame, the size according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>: on this the picture is to be executed; but it is most eligible not to paste the paper on till the whole subject is first dead coloured. The method of doing this is very easy, by laying the paper with the dead-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> on its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, upon a smooth board or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, when, by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>, the back side of the paper must be covered with paste; the frame, with the strained cloth, must then be laid on the pasted side of the paper; after which turn the painted side uppermost, and lay a piece of clean paper upon it, to prevent smearing it: this being done, it may be stroked gently over with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>; by which means all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> between the cloth and the paper will be forced out.\n\nWhen the paste is perfectly dry, the student may proceed with the painting. The advantages arising from pasting the paper on the frame according to this method, after the picture is begun, are very great, as the crayons will adhere much better than any other way; which will enable the student to finish the picture with a firmer body of colour and greater lustre.\n\nWhen the painters want to make a very correct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of a picture, they generally make use of tiffany or black <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAUZE\">gauze</a>, strained tight on a frame, which they lay flat on the subject to be imitated, and with a piece of sketching chalk trace all the outlines on the tiffany. They then lay the canvas to be painted on flat upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>, placing the tiffany with the chalked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> upon it, and with an handkerchief brush the whole over; this presents the exact outlines of the picture on the canvas. The crayon painter may also make use of this method when the subject of his imitation is in oils; but in copying a crayon-picture, he must have recourse to the following method, on account of the glaigs.\n\nThe picture being placed upon the easel, let the outlines be drawn on the glaigs with a small camel's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> dipped in lake, ground thin with oils, which must be done with great exactness. After this is accomplished, take a sheet of paper of the same size and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> it on the glaigs, stroking over all the lines with the hand, by which means the colour will adhere to the paper, which must be pierced with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a>-holes pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to each other. The paper intended to be used for the painting must next be laid upon a table, and the pierced paper placed upon it; then with some fine-pounded charcoal, tied up in a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAWN\">lawn</a>, rub over the pierced lines, which will give an exact outline; but great care must be taken not to brush this off till the whole is drawn over with sketching chalk, which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> made of whiting and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>-pipe clay, rolled like the crayons, and pointed at each end.\n\nWhen a student paints immediately from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, it will be most prudent to make a correct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> of the outlines on another paper, the size of the picture he is going to paint, which he may trace by the preceding method, because erroneous strokes of the sketching chalk (which are not to be avoided without great expertise) will prevent the crayons from adhering to the paper, owing to a certain greasy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> in the composition.\n\nThe student will find the sitting posture, with the box of crayons in his lap, the most convenient method for him to paint. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the picture he is immediately painting should be rather below his face; for, if it is placed too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, the arm will be fatigued. Let the windows of the room where he paints be darkened, at least to the height of six feet from the ground; and the subject to be painted should be situated in such a manner, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> with every advantage on the face, avoiding too much shadow, which seldom has a good effect in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> painting, especially if the face he paints from has any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of delicacy.\n\nBefore he begins to paint, let him be attentive to his subject, and appropriate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> or attitude proper to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of the subject: if a child, let it be childlike; if a young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>, express more vivacity than in the majestic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of a middle-aged woman, who also should not be expressed with the same gravity as a person far advanced in years. Let the embellishments of the picture, and introduction of birds, animals, &c., be regulated by the rules of propriety and consistency.\n\nThe features of the face being correctly drawn with chalks,\nchalks, let the student take a crayon of pure carmine, and carefully draw the nostril and edge of the nose next the shadow; then, with the faintest carmine tint, lay in the highest light upon the nose and forehead, which must be executed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>. He is then to proceed gradually with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> tint, and the succeeding ones, till he arrives at the shadows, which must be covered brilliant, enriched with much lake, carmine, and deep green. This method will at first offensively strike the eye, from its crude appearance; but in the finishing, it will be a good foundation to produce a pleasing effect, colours being much more easily filled when too bright than when the first colouring is dull, to raise the picture into a brilliant state. The several pearly tints discernible in fine complexions must be imitated with blue verditer and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, which answers to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ULTRAMARINE\">ultramarine</a> tints used in oils. But if the parts of the face where these tints appear are in shadow, the crayons composed of black and white must be substituted in their place.\n\nThough all the face when first coloured should be laid in as brilliant as possible, yet each part should be kept in its proper tone; by which means the roundness of the face will be preserved.\n\nLet the student be careful, when he begins the eyes, to draw them with a crayon inclined to the carmine tint, of whatever colour the irises are of; he must lay them in brilliant, and at first not loaded with colour, but executed lightly: no notice is to be taken of the pupil yet. The student must let the light of the eye incline very much to the blue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>, cautiously avoiding a staring white appearance (which, when once introduced, is seldom overcome), preferring a broad shadow thrown on its upper part by the eyelash. A black and heavy tint is also to be avoided in the eyebrows; it is therefore best to execute them like a broad glowing shadow at first, on which, in the finishing, the hairs of the brow are to be painted; by which method of proceeding, the former tints will show themselves through, and produce the most pleasing effect.\n\nThe student should begin the lips with pure carmine and lake, and in the shadow use some carmine and black; the strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMILION\">vermilion</a> tints should be laid on afterwards. He must beware of executing them with stiff, harsh lines, gently intermixing each with the neighbouring colours, making the shadow beneath broad, and enriched with brilliant crayons. He must form the corner of the mouth with carmine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> ochre, and greens, variously intermixed. If the hair is dark, he should prefer much of the lake and deep carmine tints therein; this may easily be overpowered by the warmer hair-tints, which, as observed in painting the eyebrows, will produce a richer effect when the picture is finished; on the contrary, if this method is unknown or neglected, a poverty of colouring will be discernible.\n\nAfter the student has covered over, or, as artists term it, has dead-coloured the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, he is to sweeten the whole together, by rubbing it over with his finger, beginning at the strongest light upon the forehead, pulling his finger very lightly, and uniting it with the next tint, which he must continue till the whole is sweetened together, often wiping his finger on a towel to prevent the colours being filled. He must be cautious not to smooth or sweeten his picture too often, because it will give rise to a thin and scanty effect, and have more the appearance of a drawing than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> painting; as nothing but a body of rich colours can constitute a rich effect. To avoid this (as the student finds it necessary to sweeten with the finger), he must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> replenish the picture with more crayon.\n\nWhen the head is brought to some degree of forwardness, let the back-ground be laid in, which must be treated in a different manner, covering it as thin as possible, and rubbing it into the paper with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> stump. Near the face the paper should be almost free from colour, for this will do great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to the head, and by its thinness give both a soft and solid appearance. In the back-ground also, no crayon that has whitening in its composition should be used, but chiefly such as are the most brilliant and the least adulterated. The ground being painted thin next the hair, will give the student an opportunity of painting the edges of the hair over in a light and free manner when he gives the finishing touches.\n\nThe student having proceeded thus far, the face, hair, and back-ground being entirely covered, he must carefully view the whole at some distance, remarking in what respect it is out of keeping, that is, what parts are too light and what too dark, being particularly attentive to the white or chalky appearances, which must be subdued with lake and carmine. The above method being properly put into execution, will produce the appearance of a painting principally composed of three colours, viz. carmine, black, and white, which is the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> a painter can make for the producing a fine crayon picture.\n\nThe next step is, to complete the back-ground and the hair, as the dust, in painting these, will fall on the face, and would much injure it if that was completed first. From thence proceed to the forehead, finishing downward till the whole picture is completed.\n\nIn painting over the forehead the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, begin the highest light with the most faint vermilion tint, in the same place where the faint carmine was first laid, keeping it broad in the same manner. In the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> succeeding the lightest, the student must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> in some light blue tints, composed of verditer and white, intermixing with them some of the deeper vermilion tints, sweetening them together with great caution, insensibly melting them into one another, increasing the proportion of each colour as his judgment shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a>. Some brilliant yellows may also be used, but sparingly; and towards the roots of the hair, strong verditer tints, intermixed with greens, will be of singular service. Cooling crayons, composed of black and white, should succeed these, and melt into the hair. Beneath the eyes, the sweet pearly tints are to be preserved, composed of verditer and white, and under the nose, and on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>, the same may be used; beneath the lips, tints of this kind also are proper, mixing them with the light greens and some vermilion.\n\nIn finishing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a>, let the pure lake clear them from any dust contracted from the other crayons; then with the lake may be intermixed the bright vermilion; and last of all (if the subject should require it) a few\ntouches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a>-coloured crayon, but with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> caution; after, sweeten that part with the finger as little as possible, for fear of producing a heavy disagreeable effect on the cheeks; as the beauty of a crayon-picture consists in one colour showing itself through, or rather between, another: this the student cannot too often remark, it being the only method of imitating beautiful complexions.\n\nThe eye is the most difficult feature to execute in crayons, as every part must be expressed with the utmost nicety, to appear finished; at the same time that the painter must preserve its breadth and solidity while he is particularizing the parts. To accomplish this, it will be a good general rule for the student to use his crayon in sweetening as much, and his finger as little, as possible. When he wants a point to touch a small part with, he may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> off a little of his crayon against the box, which will produce a corner fit to work with in the minutest parts. If the eye-lashes are dark, he must use some of the carmine and brown ochre, and the crayon of carmine and black; and with these he may also touch the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRIS\">iris</a> of the eye (if brown or hazel), making a broad shadow, caused by the eye-lash. Red teints of vermilion, carmine, and lake, will execute the corners of the eye properly; but if the eyelids are too red, they will have a disagreeable sore appearance. The pupil of the eye must be made of pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>-black: between this and the lower part of the iris, the light will catch very strong, but it must not be made too sudden, but be gently diffused round the pupil till it is lost in shade. When the eye-balls are sufficiently prepared, the thinning speck must be made with a pure white crayon, which should be first broken to a point, and then laid on firm; but as it is possible they may be defective in neatness, they should be corrected with a pin, taking off the redundant parts, by which means they may be formed as neat as can be required.\n\nThe difficulty, with respect to the nose, is to preserve the lines properly determined, and at the same time so artfully blended into the cheek, as to express its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a>, and yet no real line to be perceptible upon a close <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>; in some circumstances it should be quite blended with the cheek, which appears behind it, and determined entirely with a slight touch of red chalk. The shadow caused by the nose is generally the darkest in the whole face, partaking of no reflection from its surrounding parts. Carmine and brown ochre, carmine and black, and such brilliant crayons, will compose it best.\n\nThe student having before prepared the lips with the strongest lake and carmine, &c. must with these colours make them completely correct; and when finishing, introduce the strong vermilion, but with great caution, as they are extremely predominant. This, if properly touched, will give the lips an appearance equal, if not superior, to those executed in oils, notwithstanding the seeming superiority the latter has, by means of glazing (A), of which the former is entirely destitute.\n\nWhen the student paints the neck, he should avoid expressing the muscles too strong in the stem, nor should the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> appear too evident on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>, as both have an unpleasing effect, denoting a violent agitation of the body; a circumstance seldom necessary to express in portrait-painting. The most necessary part to be expressed, and which should ever be observed, (even in the most delicate subjects,) is a strong marking just above the place where the collar bones unite; and if the head is much thrown over the shoulders, some notice should be taken of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> muscle that rises from behind the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>, and is inserted into the pit between the collar bones. All inferior muscles should be, in general, quite avoided. The student will find this caution necessary, as most subjects, especially thin persons, have the muscles of the neck much more evident than would be judicious to imitate. As few necks are too long, it may be necessary to give some addition to the stem, a fault on the other side being quite unpardonable, nothing being more ungraceful than a short neck. In colouring the neck, let the student preserve the stem of a pearly hue, and the light not so strong as on the chest. If any part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> appears, its transparency must also be expressed by pearly teints; but the upper part of the chest should be coloured with beautiful vermilion delicately blended with the other.\n\nOf the Drapery. Dark blue, purple, black, pink, and all kinds of red draperies also, should be first tinged with carmine, which will render the colours much more brilliant than any other method; over this should be laid on the paper the middle teint (a medium between the light and dark teints, of which the drapery is to be painted), except the dark masses of shadow, which should be laid on at first as deep as possible; these, sweetened with the finger, being destitute of the smaller folds, will exhibit a masterly breadth, which the lesser folds when added, ought by no means to destroy. With the light and dark teints, the smaller parts are next to be made with freedom, executing as much with the crayon, and as little with the finger, as possible; in each fold touching the last stroke with the crayon, which stroke the finger must never touch. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of reflections, the simple touch of the crayon will be too harsh, therefore fingering will be necessary afterwards, as reflected lights are always more gentle than those which are direct. With respect to reflections in general, they must always partake of the same colour as the object reflecting, but in the case of single figures, it may be useful to make some particular observation.\n\nIn a blue drapery, let the reflections be of a greenish cast; in green draperies, make them of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> teint; in yellow, of an orange; in orange, reflect a reddish cast; in all reds, something of their own nature, but inclined to the yellow; black should have a reddish reflection; the reflection of a reddish teint will also present purples to the best advantage.\n\nOf whatever colour the drapery is, the reflection on the face must partake thereof, otherwise the picture,\n\n(A) The method with which painters in oils express transparency in the lips is, by painting them first with light vermilion teints, and, when dry, touching them over with pure lake.\nLinen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LACE\">lace</a>, fur, &c. should be touched spiritedly with the crayon, fingering very little, except the latter; and the last touches, even of this, like all other parts, should be executed with the crayon, without sweetening with the finger.\n\nThe methods above recommended have been practiced by the most celebrated crayon-painters, whose works have been held in public estimation; but the knowledge of, and ability to execute, each separate part with brilliancy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, will be found very insufficient to constitute a complete painter, without his judgment enables him to unite them with each other, by correctness of drawing, propriety of light and shadow, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> of colouring. In order to accomplish this, the student should carefully avoid finishing one part in particular, till he has properly considered the connection it is to have with the rest. The neglect of this is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> reason why the performances of indifferent painters are so destitute of what is termed breadth, so conspicuously beautiful in the works of great masters. It must be granted, that this observation relates more particularly to large compositions, where a diversity of figures requires such a judicious disposition, that each may assist in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> harmony; yet, even in portrait-painting, the student should be particularly attentive to observe this idea of breadth, if he is desirous of acquiring that importance and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> which constitutes excellence in painting.\n\nOf the Materials. The perfection of the crayons consists, in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, in their softness; for it is impossible to execute a brilliant picture with them if they are otherwise; on which account great care should be observed in preparing them, to prevent their being hard. In all compositions, flake-white and white-lead should be wholly rejected, because the slightest touch with either of these would unavoidably turn black.\n\nThe usual objection to crayon-paintings is, that they are subject to change; but whenever this happens, it is entirely owing to an injudicious use of the above-mentioned whites, which will stand only in oils. To obviate the bad effects arising from the use of such crayons, let the student make use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> whiting prepared in the following manner.\n\nTake a large vessel of water, put the whiting into it, and mix them well together; let this stand about half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, then pour off the top into another vessel, and throw the gritty sediment away; let what is prepared rest about a minute, and then pour it off as before, which will purify the whiting and render it free from all dirt and grittiness. When this is done let the whiting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a>, and then pour the water from it; after which, lay it on the chalk to dry, and keep it for use, either for white crayons, or the purpose of preparing teints with other colours, for with this all other teints may be safely prepared. If the student chooses to make crayons of the whiting immediately after it is washed, it is not necessary to dry it on the chalk, for it may be mixed instantly with any other colour, which will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> considerable trouble. All colours of a heavy or gritty nature, especially blue verditer, must be purified by washing after this method.\n\nThe student must be provided with a large, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> pallet-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, a large stone and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULLER\">muller</a> to levigate the colours, two or three large pieces of chalk to absorb the moisture from the colours after they are levigated, a piece of flat glass to prevent the moisture from being absorbed too much, till the colours are rolled into form, and vessels for water, spirits, &c. as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> and convenience shall direct.\n\n1. Reds. It is rather difficult to procure either good carmine or good lake. Good carmine is inclined to the vermilion teint, and good lake to the carmine teint. The carmine crayons are prepared in the following manner.\n\n1. Carmine. As their texture is inclinable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a>, instead of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> and rolling them, take a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of carmine, lay it upon the grinding-stone, mix it with a levitating knife with spirits of wine till it becomes smooth and even. The chalk-stone being ready, lay the colour upon it to absorb the spirit; but be careful that it is laid on in a proper state for painting. If it is levigated too thin, the crayons will be too flat; and if too thick, it will occasion a waste of colour, by their adhering to the pallet knife; but practice will render the proper degree of consistency familiar. The simple colour being prepared, the next step is to compose the different teints by a mixture with whiting; the proportion to be observed consisting of 20 gradations to one, which may be clearly understood by the following directions. Take some of the simple colour, and levigate it with spirit of wine, adding about one part of washed whiting to three parts of carmine, of which, when properly incorporated, make two parcels. The next gradation should be composed of equal quantities of carmine and whiting, of which four crayons may be made. The third composition should have one fourth carmine and three fourths whiting; of this make six crayons, which will be a good proportion for the rest. The last teint should be made of whiting, very faintly tinged with carmine, of which make about eight crayons, which will complete the above-mentioned proportion. As these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> teints are levigated, they are to be laid immediately upon the chalk, that the moisture may be absorbed to the proper degree of dryness for forming into crayons, which may be known by its losing the greater part of its adhesive quality when taken into the hand; if the consistency is found to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, it may be then laid upon the glass, which having no pores, will prevent the moisture from being carried off before it is convenient to form it into crayons, otherwise the crayons would be full of cracks and very brittle, which will be a great inconvenience when they are used in painting.\n\n2. Lake. This is a colour very apt to be hard; to prevent which the student must observe the following particulars. Take about half the quantity of lake intended for the crayons, and grind it very fine with spirits of wine; let it dry, and then pulverize it, which is easily done if the lake is good; then take the other half, and grind it with spirits, after which mix it with the pulverized lake, and lay it out directly in crayons on the chalk. This colour will not bear rolling. The simple colour being thus prepared, proceed with the compound crayons as directed before, and in the same degrees of gradation as the carmine teints.\n\n3. Vermilion.\n3. Vermilion. The best is inclined to the carmine\nteint. Nothing is required to prepare this colour more\nthan to mix it on the stone with soft water or spirits,\nafter which it may be rolled into crayons. The differ-\nent teints are produced by a mixture of the simple\ncolour with whiting, according to the proportion al-\nready given.\n\nII. Blues. 1. Prussian blue is a colour very apt\nto bind, and is rendered soft with more difficulty than\ncarmine and lake. The same method of preparation is\nto be followed with this as directed with respect to\nlake, only it is necessary to grind a larger quantity of\nthe pure colour, as it is chiefly used for painting drap-\neries. The different teints may be made according\nto necessity, or the fancy of the painter. 2. Blue ver-\nditer is a colour naturally gritty, and therefore it is\nnecessary to wash it well. Its particles are so coarse\nas to require some binding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> to unite them, other-\nwise the crayons will never adhere together. To ac-\ncomplish this, take a quantity sufficient to form two\nor three crayons, to which add a piece of slaked pla-\nster of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> about the size of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEA\">pea</a>; mix these well\ntogether, and form the crayons upon the chalk. This\nblue is extremely brilliant, and will be of great use in\nheightening draperies, &c. The teints must be formed\nwith whiting as directed in the former instances, and\nare highly serviceable for painting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, to produce\nthose pearly teints so beautiful in crayon pictures. It\nis not necessary to mix the compounds with spirits, as\nclear water will be sufficient.\n\nIII. Greens. Brilliant greens are produced with\ngreat difficulty. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>, they have a method\nof making them far superior to ours. We usually\ntake yellow ochre, and after grinding it with spirits,\nmix it with the powder of Prussian blue, then tem-\nper it with a knife, and lay the crayons on the chalk,\nwithout rolling them. Instead of this, some\nuse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s yellow mixed with Prussian blue, and others\nbrown ochre and Prussian blue. The crayons made of\nthe two last may be rolled. Various teints may be\nproduced by these colours, according to fancy or ne-\ncessity; some partaking more of the blue, and others\nof the yellow.\n\nIV. Yellows. 1. King's yellow is the most useful\nand the most brilliant, levigated with spirits of wine,\nto compose the different teints as before directed.\n2. Yellow ochre, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a> yellow ground with spirits,\nwill make useful crayons. 3. Orange is produced with\nking's yellow and vermilion ground together with\nspirits, and the teints formed as in other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, but no\ngreat quantity of them is required.\n\nV. Browns. 1. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> is a fine dark\nbrown. After six or eight of the simple crayons are\nprepared, several rich compound teints may be pro-\nduced from it, by a mixture with carmine, in various\ndegrees. Black, carmine, and this colour, mixed to-\ngether, make useful teints for painting hair; several\ngradations may be produced from each of these by a\nmixture with whiting. Rome or brown ochre is an\nexcellent colour, either simple or compounded with\ncarmine. Whiting tinged in several degrees with\neither of these, will prove very serviceable in paint-\ning. 2. Umber may be treated in just the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>-\nner; only it is necessary to levigate it with spirit of\nwine.\n\nVI. Purples. Prussian blue ground with spirits\nand mixed with pulverized lake, will produce a good\npurple. Carmine, thus mixed with Prussian blue, will\nproduce a purple something different from the former.\nVarious teints may be made from either of these com-\npounds by a mixture with whiting.\n\nVII. Black. 1. Lamp-black is the only black that\ncan be used with safety, as all others are subject to\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILDEW\">mildew</a>; but as good lamp-black is very scarce, the\nstudent will, perhaps, find it most expedient to make\nit himself; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of which is as follows: Pro-\nvide a tin cone, fix it over a lamp at such a height\nthat the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> may just reach the cone for the foot\nto gather within it. When a sufficient quantity is\ncollected, take it out, and burn all the grease from it\nin a crucible. It must then be ground with spirits,\nand laid on the chalk to absorb the moisture. Various\ngray teints may be formed from this by a mixture\nwith whiting, as mentioned in former instances.\u2014\n2. Vermilion mixed with carmine: this is a composi-\ntion of great use, and teints made from this with whit-\ning will be found to be very serviceable. 3. Carmine\nand black is another good compound, of which five or\nsix gradations should be made, some partaking more of\nthe black, and others having the carmine most predo-\nminant, besides several teints by a mixture with whit-\ning. 4. Vermilion and black is also a very useful\ncompound, from which several different teints should\nbe made. 5. Prussian blue and black is another good\ncompound, and will be found of singular service in\npainting draperies.\n\nIt is impossible to lay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> rules for the forming\nevery teint necessary in composing a set of crayons,\nthere being many accidental compositions, entirely de-\npendent on fancy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>. The student should\nmake it a rule to save the leavings of his colours; for\nof these he may form various teints, which will occa-\nsionally be useful.\n\nOf rolling the crayons, and disposing them for paint-\ning. The different compositions of colours must be cut\ninto a proper magnitude, after they are prepared, in\norder to be rolled into pastils, for the convenience of\nusing them. Each crayon should be formed in the left\nhand with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> of the right, first formed cylindri-\ncally, and then tapering at each end. If the compo-\nsition is too dry, dip the finger in water; if too wet,\nthe composition must be laid upon the chalk again to\nabsorb more of the moisture. The crayons should be\nrolled as quick as possible; and when finished, must\nbe laid upon the chalk again, to absorb all remaining\nmoisture. After the gradation of teints from\none colour is formed, the stone should be well\nscraped and cleansed with water before it is used for\nanother colour.\n\nWhen the set of crayons is completed according to\nthe rules prescribed, they should be arranged in cases\nfor the convenience of painting with them. Some thin\ndrawers, divided into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of partitions, is the\nmost convenient method of disposing them properly.\nThe crayons should be deposited according to the sev-\neral gradations of light. The bottom of the partitions\nmust be covered with bran, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> for the colours;\nbecause it not only preserves them clean, but prevents\ntheir breaking.\n\nThe box made use of when the student paints should\nCRAZE-MILL be about a foot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> partitions. In the upper corner on the left hand (supposing the box to be in the lap when he paints), let him place the black and gray crayons, those being the most seldom used; in the second partition, the blues; in the third, the greens and browns; in the first partition on the left hand of the second row, the carmines, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, vermilions, and all deep reds; the yellows and orange in the middle, and the pearly teints next; and as these last are of a very delicate nature, they must be kept very clean, that the gradations of colour may be easily distinguished; in the lower row, let the first partition contain a piece of fine linen rag to wipe the crayons with while they are using; the second, all the pure lake and vermilion teints; and the other partition may contain those teints which, from their complex nature, cannot be clasped with any of the former.","sp":350,"ep":355},{"h":"CRAZE-MILL","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> CRAZING MILL, a mill in all respects like a grist-mill to grind corn, and so called by the tin miners, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> it to grind their tin, which is yet too great after trampling.","sp":355,"ep":355},{"h":"CREAM","t":"a general name applicable to all substances that separate from a liquor, and are collected upon its surface; but more particularly applied to the following.\n\nCREAM of Lime, is that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the lime which had been dissolved in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> in its caustic state, but having again attracted some fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, becomes incapable of solution, and therefore separates from the water in the mild state of chalk <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>.\n\nCREAM of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">Milk</a>, generally called simple cream, is the most oily part of the milk; which being naturally only mixed, and not dissolved in the rest, soon separates from them, as being specifically <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a>; after which it collects on the surface; from which it is generally skimmed, to complete the disengagement of the oily parts, for the purpose of making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, from the caseous and ferrous parts.

It is also, however, used in a secondary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> subordinate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, to denote those subsequent operations of the Deity upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> so produced, by which the whole system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and all the primitive genera of things received their form, qualities and laws.\n\nThere is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> subject concerning which there have been more disputes than this of creation. It is certain that none of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> philosophers had the smallest idea of its being possible to produce a substance out of nothing, or that even the power of the Deity himself could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> without any materials to work upon. Hence some of them, among whom was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, asserted that the world was eternal both as to matter and form. Others, though they believed that the gods had given the world its form, yet imagined the materials whereof it is composed to have been eternal. Indeed the opinions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, who had not the benefit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a>, were on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> so confused and contradictory, that nothing of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> can be deduced from them. The freethinkers of our own and of former ages have denied the possibility of creation, as being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> to reason; and of consequence have taken the opportunity from thence to discredit revelation. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, many defenders of the sacred writings have affirmed, that creation out of nothing, so far from being a contradiction to reason, is not only probable, but demonstrably certain. Nay, some have gone so far as to say, that from the very inspection of the visible system of nature, we are able to infer that it was once in a state of non-existence. It would be impossible for us, however, to enter into the multiplicity of arguments used on both sides; nor can we pretend to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> it, as the subject is confessedly above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a>.\n\nAs to the works of creation which the Deity is known to us to have performed; all other beings, being God's creatures, Men and other animals that inhabit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> and the seas; all the imknown to menfie <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of herbs and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> of which the vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> consists; the globe of the earth, and formed, the expanse of the ocean; these we know to have been produced by his power. Besides the terrestrial world which we inhabit, we see many other material bodies disposed around it in the wide <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of space. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, which is in a particular manner connected with our earth, and even dependent upon it; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, and the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a> with their satellites, which, like the earth, circulate round the sun, and appear to derive from him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>; those bodies which we call fixed stars, and consider as illuminating and cherishing with heat each its peculiar system of planets; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMETS\">comets</a> which at certain periods surprise us with their appearance, and the nature of whose connection with the general system of nature, or with any particular system of planets, we cannot pretend to have fully discovered;\u2014these are so many more of the Deity's works, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of which we cannot but conceive the most awful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of his creative power.\n\nMatter, however, whatever the varieties of form under which it is made to appear, the relative disposition of its parts, or the motions communicated to it, is but an inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the works of creation. We believe ourselves to be animated with a much higher principle than brute matter; in viewing the manners and economy of the lower animals, we can scarcely avoid acknowledging even them to consist of something more than various modifications of matter and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. The other planetary bodies which seem to be in circumstances nearly analogous to those of our earth, are surely, as well as it, destined for the habitations of rational,\nrational, intelligent beings. The existence of intelligences of a higher order than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, though infinitely below the Deity, appears extremely probable.\u2014Of those spiritual beings called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">Angels</a> we have express intimation in scripture; (see the article ANGELS.) Such are our notions concerning the existence of beings essentially distinct from matter, and in their nature far superior to it; these, too, must be the creatures of the Deity, and of his works of creation the noblest part. But the limits of creation we must not pretend to define. How far the regions of space extend, or how they are filled, we know not. How the planetary worlds, the sun and the fixed stars, are occupied, we do not pretend to have ascertained. We are even ignorant how wide a diversity of forms, what an infinity of living animated beings may inhabit our own globe. So confined is our knowledge of creation; yet so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a>, so awful, that part which our narrow understandings can comprehend!\n\nConcerning the periods of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> at which the Deity executed his several works of creation, it cannot be pretended that mankind have had opportunities of receiving very particular information. From viewing the phenomena of nature, and considering the general laws by which they are regulated, we cannot draw any conclusive or even plausible inference with respect to the precise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> at which the universe must have begun to exist. We know not, nor can we hope to ascertain, whether the different systems of planets circulating round our sun and the other fixed stars, were all created at one period, or each at a different period. We cannot even determine, from anything that appears on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of nature, whether our earth was not created at a later period than any of her fellow planets which revolve round the same sun. Astronomers are, from time to time, making new discoveries in the heavens; and it is impossible to say whether some of these successive discoveries may not be owing to successive creations.\n\nPhilosophers have, indeed, formed some curious conjectures concerning the antiquity of the earth, from the appearances of its surface, and from the nature and disposition of its interior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a>. The beds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAVA\">lava</a> in the neighbourhood of volcanoes have afforded ground for some calculations, which, though they do not fix the period of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH_S\">earth's</a> origin, are yet thought to prove that period to have been much more remote than the earliest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of sacred or profane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>. In the neighbourhood of Mount Etna, or on the sides of that extensive mountain, there are beds of lava covered with a considerable thickness of earth; and at least another, again, which though known from ancient monuments and historical records to have issued from the volcano at least 2000 years ago, is still almost entirely destitute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> and vegetation: in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> a pit has been cut through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> different strata of lava; and these have been found separated from each other by almost as many thick beds of rich earth. Now, from the fact, that a stratum of lava 2000 years old is yet scarcely covered with earth, it has been inferred by the ingenious canon Recupero, who has laboured 30 years on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> history of Mount Etna, that the lowest of these strata which have been found divided by so many beds of earth, must have been emitted from the volcanic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRATER\">crater</a> at least 14,000 years ago; and consequently that the age of the earth, whatever it may exceed this term of years, cannot possibly be less. Other facts of a similar nature likewise concur to justify this conjecture.\n\nBut all these facts are as nothing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> which would be requisite to establish such a conjecture as an incontrovertible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. And besides, any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> which they can be supposed to afford, may be very easily explained away. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of lava, which in the course of 2000 years has scarcely acquired a covering of earth, is confessed to stand in a situation in which it is exposed to the spray of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and to all the violence of winds and rains. In such a situation, it cannot be thought that a thick bed of earth could, in any length of time, be formed on it: we might as well expect depth of foil and vigorous vegetation on the craggy cliffs of hills. In crevices here and there over it, in which the earth has been retained, there is a depth of foil which supports <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> trees. This fact, therefore, admits of no such inference as that which Recupero has pretended to deduce from it. The local circumstances, again, of the seven strata that have been pierced through, are very different. They are situated at Jaci Reale, in a situation where showers of ashes from the volcano must frequently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>; and where whatever falls must be naturally retained and accumulated\u2014so that seven beds of earth might be formed on these seven strata of lava much sooner than one thin layer could be formed on the stratum above-mentioned. In other places, some of which are within the influence of the same awful volcano, and some adjacent to that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VESUVIUS\">Vesuvius</a>, it is known to have accumulated on lava with the help of showers of ashes from the volcanoes, with sufficient rapidity to justify this supposition concerning the coverings of the strata at Jaci Reale. From the observation of these phenomena of volcanoes, therefore, no facts have been gained that can help us to determine with any certainty the earth's age. And so wide is the variety of circumstances to be here taken into account, that it cannot be hoped that this desideratum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> ever be supplied from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>. See further the article EARTH.\n\nBut by examining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> and arrangement of the interior strata of the globe, and by viewing the general appearance of its surface, the ingenuity of philosophers has, with better hopes, sought to guess at the length of time during which it must have existed. Observing the exuviae of sea and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> animals deposited at profound depths under ground, and accompanied with vegetable bodies in a good state of preservation, as well as with oleaginous and bituminous substances which have in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> been formed from vegetable bodies; and remarking at the same time with what confusion the other materials composing the crust of this terrestrial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>, are, in various instances, not arranged, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> together; they have concluded that the earth must have existed for many an age before the earliest events recorded in sacred or profane history, and must have undergone many a revolution, before it settled in its present state. Such at least are the ideas which Buffon and M. de Luc, and also Dr Hutton, seem desirous to impress us with concerning its changes and antiquity.\u2014It will be only doing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to these philosophers to acknowledge, that vol. I.\nthey have collected, with amazing industry, almost every fact in the natural history of the earth that can serve to give plausibility to their conjectures. But still their facts, besides the inconsistency of many of them, are by far too scanty to warrant the conclusions which they have deduced from them. See the article EARTH.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of profane history is far from being decisive concerning the age of the world; nor is it to be expected that it should. When the earth first arose into existence, we can be at no loss to conceive that mankind were not spectators of the event; and we may naturally imagine that the first human beings who occupied it, would be too much baffled in furnishing themselves with the immediate necessities and the conveniences of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, to think of curious researches into its origin, or even their own. Profane history is not, however, without accounts of the age of the earth and the origin of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>; but those accounts are various and contradictory.\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a> entitled Critias, mentions his celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATLANTIS\">Atlantis</a> to have been buried in the ocean about 9000 years before the age in which he wrote. He affirms it to have been well known to the Egyptian priests and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTICA\">Attica</a>. The learned world, indeed, generally agree in regarding his accounts of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> as a fiction, which the author himself did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to be understood in any other light; some, however, are more credulous, and others go so far as to acknowledge doubts; and, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the existence of such an island, at a period so distant, be admitted as a fact worthy of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, the age of the world may be reckoned as at least considerably more than 12,000 years. The pretensions of the Chinese represent the world as some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a> of thousands of years older; and we are also told* that the astronomical records of the ancient Chaldeans carried back the origin of society to a very remote period; no less than 473,000 years. The Egyptian priests reckoned between Menes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SETHON\">Sethon</a> 341 generations.+ But these accounts are so discordant, and so slenderly supported by evidence, that we cannot hesitate to reject them all as false; the fables of historians scarce merit so much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> as the hypotheses of philosophers.\n\nWhen from profane we turn to sacred history, we may reasonably expect more accurate and more credible information concerning the antiquity of the globe. As the authenticity of the Holy Scriptures is so incontrovertibly established, wherever they afford evidence concerning any fact, that evidence must be regarded as decisive. A fact so important as the present may be thought highly worthy of a place in them. Unfortunately, however, even the sacred writings do not fix the era of the creation with sufficient accuracy; they leave us, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, at a loss whether to extend what they say concerning that era to the whole contents of created space, or to confine it to our earth and its inhabitants: different copies give different dates; and even in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a>, different parts relating the same events, either disagree or do not speak decisively with regard to the length of the time in which they passed.\u2014In the beginning of the fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of the first book of Kings, the time which elapsed between the departure of the children of Israel from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, and the period at which Solo-\n\nVol. VI. Part II.\n\nmon laid the foundation of his temple, is said to have been 480 years: And in the book of Judges again, the age of all the patriarchs amounts to 52 years.\u2020 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> copy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a>, which we Christian Hi\u017ft vol. I. for good reasons consider as the most authentic, dates <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">Preface</a>. the creation of the world 3944 years before the Christian era. The Samaritan Bible, again, fixes the era of the creation 4325 years before the birth of Christ. And the Greek translation, known by the name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEPTUAGINT\">Septuagint</a> version of the Bible, gives 5270 as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the years which intervened between those two periods. As many other different calculations of the years contained in the same intermediate space of time, might be formed upon other dates in the sacred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, differing in the different copies. By comparing the various dates in the sacred writings, examining how they have come to disagree and to be diversified in different copies, endeavouring to reconcile the most authentic profane with sacred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">chronology</a>, and eking out deficiency of dates and evidence with conjecture; some ingenious men have formed schemes of chronology, plausible indeed, but not supported by sufficient authorities, which they would gladly persuade us to receive in preference to any of those above mentioned. Ulher makes out from the Hebrew Bible 4004 years, as the term between the creation and the birth of Christ; Josephus, according to Dr Wills and Mr Whitton, makes it 4658 years; and M. Pezron, with the help of the Septuagint, extends it to 5872 years. Ulher's system is the most generally received.\n\nBut though these different systems of chronology are so inconsistent and so slenderly supported, yet the differences among them are so inconsiderable in comparison with those which arise before us when we contemplate the chronology of the Chinese, the Chaldeans, and the Egyptians, and they agree so well with the general information of authentic history and with the appearances of nature and of society, that they may be considered as nearly fixing the true period of the creation of the earth.\n\nProfane history cannot be expected to contain an account of the first events which passed after the creation of the substances of which the universe consists; the head The conjectures of ancient philosophers on this subject cannot merit attention; for vague <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>, and any other the appearances of nature, the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATA\">data</a> on which source but they could proceed in forming their conjectures, could admit of no fair inductions concerning those events; and besides, instead of listening to tradition, or examining the appearances of nature, they generally consulted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, and imagination alone, on such occasions. Here, therefore, we have nothing to hope but from the sacred writings. From them we may expect historical information, not to be obtained from any other source. What they communicate is communicated on divine authority; and it is only on such authority we can receive any accounts concerning the creation.\n\nA few hints in the book of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOB\">Job</a> afford the earliest Hints coninformation to be found in the scriptures concerning concerning the creation of the world. \"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> Job. stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted * Chap. for joy?\" \"Behold, he put no trust in his servants,\" xxxviii.\n\nand ver. 4 & 7\nand his angels he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with folly.\" \"And unto man, (or to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a>), he said, Behold, the fear of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, and to depart from evil is understanding.\" These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> rather hint at than relate facts. But it has been inferred from them, that there were stars in the firmament, and angels in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, before the formation of our globe; that angels as well as man have fallen; and that other injunctions, besides that of abstaining from the forbidden fruit, were laid on Adam when he was first placed in Paradise. If the interpretation be admitted as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a>, the first of these facts may be considered as forming, as it were, a point with which our knowledge of the works of the Deity commences: the period of time at which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> event took place is not specified; and the precept to Adam must no doubt have been uttered after he was formed and inspired with intelligence. Yet with regard to the first of the above quotations from the book of Job, the only one that is of importance to us at present, it must be acknowledged, that it has been differently understood. The morning stars might sing together, and the sons of God <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOUT\">shout</a> for joy, on account both of their own creation and of the creation of the earth at one time; and yet Job, having been himself made a conscious being at a much later period, not be able to tell where he was at that era of exulting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> and congratulation.\n\nMoses relates, that \"in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. And the earth (continues he) was without form and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light; and there was light. And God <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and the darkness he called night: and the evening and the morning were the first day.\" During five succeeding days the work of creation was carried on. On the second day, a firmament was made to separate the waters, and that firmament called heaven: on the third day, the waters were collected into seas, and the land from which the waters retired caused to produce grass and trees and other plants: on the fourth day, lights were made to appear in the firmament; to enlighten the earth, to divide the day from the night, and to distinguish time into seasons and years: on the fifth day, the seas were peopled with whales and other fishes, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> with fowls: on the sixth day, the earth was furnished with reptiles and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a> of all kinds; and on the same day, the first human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a>, the progenitors of all the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, were created in God's own image.\n\nSome difficulties occur in comparing this account of the creation with the laws which appear at present to regulate the system of nature. We find it hard to conceive how the earth, while yet a stranger to the influence of the sun, could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> the vicissitude of day and night; and are astonished at the rapidity with which trees and herbage first overspread its surface. The condition of matter when the earth was without form and void, and the operation of the spirit of God on the face of the waters, are equally mysterious.\n\nSome ingenious men have eagerly laboured to remove these difficulties. Among these is Dr Burnet, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of the earth has now been long considered as fanciful and ill-founded. He supposes all the celestial bodies, even the sun and all the other planets of the solar system, to have existed long before the earth. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAOS\">chaos</a> on which the spirit of God moved, consisted, according to him, of the first principles from which all terrestrial bodies have been formed. When those laws by which the material world is regulated first began to operate on the mists, he supposes that its groser and heavier parts would sink towards the centre, and there form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> ball. Around this solid ball two species of particles would still float together in confusion. Of these he thinks one, being more volatile, would by degrees make its escape from the other, would leave it still recumbent on the solid centre, and spread around it in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. The middle stratum he composes of aqueous and oleaginous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>; and he makes no doubt, that after the air had made its escape, the levity of the oleaginous fluids would enable them to rise above the aqueous, and dispose themselves next the surface of the liquid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>. On them he supposes the impure atmosphere to have then deposited a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of terrene particles, sufficient to form, by intermixture with the oils, a thick crust of rich earth for the production of plants and herbage, and to afford an habitation to animals. This delicate shell he was careful not to furrow with seas or load with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>: either of these would have reduced all to confusion. Such is his earth; and after moulding it with so much ingenuity, and into so happy a form, he contents himself, without venturing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> the same freedoms with the remaining part of Moses's account of the creation.\n\nBut Moses affords nothing that can be with any objections propriety used in the foundation of such a theory: he to Dr Burnet finds not whether the chaos consisted of those terrene, and aqueous, and oleaginous, and aerial particles which Dr Burnet finds in it; he confines not the seas within a crust of earth; nor does he inform us that the scenery of nature was not diversified by hills and vales. Besides, the author of this theory has, without any evidence, supposed matter to have been originally under the influence of laws very different from those by which it is at present regulated. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">Oil</a>, indeed, while fluid, floats above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; but in a concrete state, it sinks in water like other solid bodies. If reduced into that state by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> with terrene matters, sufficient to render the mixture proper for the nourishment and production of vegetables; its specific gravity will be still greater, and it will consequently sink to much the sooner. How a concrete substance, consisting of earth and oil, could float on water, appears an inexplicable enigma. But we need not here take farther pains in combating and triumphing over this theory, which has long since fallen and sunk to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>.\n\nMr Whiston treats both the scriptures and the laws of nature with greater reverence. Yet he certainly involves himself in no trifling difficulties in attempting to solve those which Moses presents. He supposes the sun, moon, and stars to be all more ancient than the earth. The chaos from which the earth was formed, he represents as having been originally the atmosphere of a comet. The six days of the creation he would persuade us to believe equal to six of our years.\nyears; for he is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that the earth did not revolve daily round its axis, but only annually round its orbit, till after the fall of man.\n\nOn the first day or year, therefore, the more ponderous parts of the chaos were, according to this theory, conglomerated into an orb of earth, the chinks and interlices over that orb filled up with water, and the exterior part or atmosphere rarefied, so as to admit some faint glimmering of the rays of the sun.\n\nOn the second day, the atmosphere was diffused to its due extent around the earth, and reduced to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of rarity and purity which rendered it still more suitable for the transmission of light; the earth was still more consolidated; and the waters being almost entirely excluded from the interlices which they before occupied, were partly spread over the surface of the earth, and partly raised in vapour into the atmosphere or firmament.\n\nOn the third day, the earth's surface became so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>, in one place rising into hills, in another sinking into vales, as to cause the waters, which were before equally diffused, to collect into seas and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, leaving large tracts of ground unoccupied. And no sooner was a part of the earth's surface left bare by the waters, than the general influence of the sun produced on it a rich covering of herbage, and all the different species of vegetables.\n\nOn the fourth day, the earth was rendered subject to the regular influence of the sun, moon, and stars.\n\nOn the fifth day or year, things were so far advanced, that fishes and fowls were now produced from the waters.\n\nOn the sixth day was the earth furnished with animals; and the lord of all the other animals, man, was now created.\n\nSuch is Mr Whifton's account of the phenomena of the Mosaic creation. But he likewife affirms much more than can be reasonably granted. The atmosphere of a comet could not well be the primitive chaos: It is not an obscure, but a pellucid fluid; and its exterior strata, if of the same nature with the matter of our earth, must be scorified by its near approaches to the sun. Had the earth not begun to move round its axis till after the work of creation was completed, the immoderate degrees of heat and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> which its different parts would have alternately felt, would in all probability have proved fatal to both plants and animals. Even the most artful interpretation of Moses's words cannot represent him as meaning to inform us that the sun and moon were created at different periods. But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> will scarce permit us to imagine that the moon was formed before the earth. And therefore we cannot upon good grounds agree with Mr Whifton, that the creation of the earth was later than that of the other bodies of the solar system.\n\nAmong others who have endeavoured to explain the original formation of the earth, and the changes which it has undergone, is M. de Luc. This colmologist, like Mr Whifton, thinks that the days of the creation were much longer periods of time than our present days. He seems to think that the earth had existed long before the Mosaic creation; but being at that era to experience new changes, and to be regulated by new laws: that all the different events described by Moses in his history of the creation, actual-ly took place in the order in which he relates them; but that Moses's days are indefinite spaces of time, which must have been very long, but of which we cannot hope to ascertain the precise length. These are ingenious conjectures; but they do not appear necessary, nor are they justified by facts. For a fuller and more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of this part of the subject, we must refer to the article EARTH; and shall now close the present article with a short explanation of what appears to us the most natural way of understanding Moses's account of the creation.\n\nIt has been conjectured*, with great probability, that the creation of which Moses is the historian, was neither confined to the earth alone, nor extended to the whole universe. The relation which all the planets of the solar system bear to the same illuminating body countenances the conjecture, that they, together with the luminary by which they are enlightened, were all created at one period: but it would perhaps be to conceive too meanly of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, wisdom, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> power of the Deity, to suppose that before that period these had never been exerted in any work of creation. Yet even here we have not demonstrative evidence.\n\nOn the supposition that the whole solar system was created at once, which has at least the merit of doing no violence to the narrative of Moses, the creation of the sun and the other planets may be understood to have been carried on at the same time with the creation of the earth. In that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, even in the course of the first day, though not longer than our present days, those bodies might be reduced to such order, and their relative motions so far established, as to begin the distinction between light and darkness, day and night.\n\nOn the second day, we may naturally understand from Moses's narrative, that the atmosphere was purified, and the specific gravities of aqueous vapour and atmospheric air so adjusted, as to render the latter capable of supporting the former.\n\nOn the third day the waters were first collected into lakes and seas; but in what manner, we cannot well determine. Some call in the operation of earthquakes; others tell us, that when the earth was first formed, the exterior strata were, at different parts over its surface, of different specific gravities; and that the more ponderous parts now sunk nearer the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> centre, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> parts still remaining equally remote from it as before, formed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, continents, hills, and mountains. But these are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> fancies; and we have no facts to offer in their stead. On the latter part of this day vegetables were caused to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> up over the earth. Their growth must have been much more rapid than we ever behold it now: but by what particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of supernatural power that might be effected, we should in vain inquire.\n\nOn the fourth day the sun, moon and stars, were made to appear. But according to the conjecture which we have mentioned as plausible, though without ascribing to it the evidence of certain truth, those heavenly bodies are to be considered as having been created before this day. But they might now begin to exert their full influence on the earth in the same manner as they have since <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to do.\n\nThe creation of the inanimate world was now fi-","sp":355,"ep":359},{"h":"CREDIT","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">Commerce</a>, a mutual trust <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> loan of merchandise or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, on the reputation of the probity and solvability of a dealer.\n\nCredit is either public or private. Every trader ought to have some estate, stock, or portion of his own, sufficient to carry on the traffic he is engaged in; they should also keep their dealings within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, so that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> disappointment in their returns may incapacitate them from supporting their credit. Yet traders of worth and judgment may sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of borrowing money for carrying on their business to the best advantage; but then the borrower ought to be so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> to his own reputation, and to his creditors, as to be well assured that he has sufficient effects within his power to pay off his obligations in due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>.

He was advised at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> not to engage that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, when his troops were much fatigued with their march, and in great disorder; and he was disposed to have taken this advice. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> of these times was so imperfect, that the orders given for halting were not obeyed; and one corps of this mighty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOST\">host</a> impelling another, they continued advancing till they came into the presence of their enemies in much confusion.\n\nEdward had employed the forenoon of this important day in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> up his army in the most excellent order, in three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>. The first line, which consisted of 800 men at arms, 4000 English archers, and 600 Welsh foot, was commanded by his young, amiable, and heroic son, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, assisted by the earls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARWICK\">Warwick</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, and several other noblemen. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> line, composed of 800 men at arms, 4000 halberdiers, and 2400 archers, was led by the earls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARUNDEL\">Arundel</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHAMPTON\">Northampton</a>; the last line <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> body of reserve, in which were 700 men at arms, 5300 billmen, and 6000 archers, was ranged along the summit of the hill, and conducted by the king in person, attended by the lords Mowbray, Mortimer, and others. When the army was completely formed, Edward rode along the lines, and by his words and looks inspired his troops with the most ardent courage and strongest hopes of victory. He then commanded the cavalry to dismount, and the whole army to sit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> upon the grass, in their ranks, and refresh themselves with meat, drink, and rest. As soon as the French army came in view, they sprung from the ground, full of strength and spirit, and stood ready to receive them.\n\nThe king of France, assisted by the kings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJORCA\">Majorca</a>, the dukes of Lorraine and Savoy, and several other sovereign princes, with the flower of the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, laboured to restore some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of\nof order to his prodigious army, and drew it up also in three lines, but very indistinctly formed. The first line was commanded in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> by the king of Bohemia; the second by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Alen\u00e7on, the king of France's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>; and the third by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> in person; and each of these lines contained a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of troops than the whole English army.\n\nThe battle of Cressy was begun about three o'clock in the afternoon, August 26, by a great body of Genoese crossbowmen, in the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, who let fly their quarrels at too great a distance to do any execution, and were presently routed by a shower of arrows from the English archers. The earl of Alen\u00e7on, after trampling to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> Genoese, advanced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>, and made a furious attack on that corps commanded by the prince of Wales. The earls of Arundel and Northampton advanced with the second line to sustain the prince, and Alen\u00e7on was supported by as many troops as could crowd to his assistance. Here the battle raged for some time with uncommon fury; and the earl of Warwick, anxious for the fate of the day and the safety of the prince, sent a messenger to the king, intreating him to advance with the third line. Edward, who had taken his stand on a windmill on the top of the hill, from whence he had a full view of both armies, asked the messenger, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> his son was unhorsed, or wounded, or killed? and being answered, that the prince was unhurt, and performed prodigies of valour. \"Go then,\" said he, \"and tell my son and his brave companions, that I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not deprive them of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of their victory.\" This flattering message being made known, inspired the prince and his troops with redoubled ardour; and the king of Bohemia, the earl of Alen\u00e7on, and many other great men, being slain, the whole first and second lines of the French army were put to flight. Philip, undismayed at the slaughter of his troops, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of so many princes, advanced to the charge with the line under his immediate command. But this body soon shared the same fate with the other two; and Philip, after having been unhorsed, and wounded in the neck and thigh, was carried off the field by John de Hainault, and fled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more than five knights and about 60 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>, of all his mighty army, which at the beginning of the battle consisted of more than 120,000 men. Such was the famous victory of Cressy, the greatest ever gained by any king of England. After the battle, the king flew into the arms of the prince of Wales, and grasping him to his bosom, cried in an ecstacy of joy, \"My dear son, you have this day shewed yourself worthy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHTHOOD\">knighthood</a> which you lately received, and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> for which you have so bravely fought; persevere in your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> course.\" The prince, as modest as he was brave, sunk down on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a>, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> covered with blushes, and begged his father's blessing. Edward continued with his army at Cressy three days, employed in numbering and burying the dead. The French had left on this bloody <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> the king of Bohemia, 11 other princes, 80 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANNERETS\">bannerets</a>, 1200 knights, 1500 gentlemen, 4000 men at arms, and 30,000 other soldiers.","sp":363,"ep":364},{"h":"CREST","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HERALDRY\">Heraldry</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> placed above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELMET\">helmet</a> in an achievement.

According to Strabo, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> is 287 miles in length; and according to Pliny, 270; and according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCYLAX\">Scylax</a>, 312. As to its breadth, it is not, as Pliny observes, above 55 miles where widest; whence it was styled, as Stephanus observes, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">Long</a> Island. It has the Archipelago to the north, the African <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> to the south, the Carpathian sea to the east, and the Ionian to the west. Anciently it was known by the names of Aeria, Chthonia, Idea, Curete, Macaritis, &c., but its most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> name was that of Crete.\n\nThe Cretan mythologists, quoted by Diodorus Siculus, relate that the first inhabitants of the island were the Daityli Idei, who dwelt around Mount Ida; they were regarded as magicians, because they possessed a variety of knowledge, and were particularly skilled...\nCrete led in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORPHEUS\">Orpheus</a>, who distinguished himself highly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> and music, was their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a>. They discovered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of fire, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, and invented the art of working these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> in Be- recynthius, a mountain near Aptera. Those invaluable discoveries procured them divine honours. One of them, named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>, rendered himself famous by his courage and great exploits. He instituted the Olympic games; though posterity, by a mistake arising from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the same name, have ascribed that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> to the son of Alcmene; who, indeed, trod in the steps of his predecessor, and raised himself also to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a>.\n\nThe Dactyli Idaei were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CURETES\">Curetes</a>. These last at first inhabited the forests and caves of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>. Afterwards they entered into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, and contributed, by their institutions, to the civilization of mankind. They taught men to collect flocks of sheep, to tame the ferocity of wild animals for domestic purposes, and to invite bees into hives, that they might sate them of the fruit of their labours. They first prompted men to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a>, and taught the use of the bow. They were the inventors of swords and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> dances. The noise which they made, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a> in armour, hindered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a> from hearing the cries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> Rhea had entrusted to them. With the assistance of the nymphs, they brought up that god in a cave in Mount Ida, feeding him with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> of the goat Amalthea, and with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>.\n\nTo this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-MYTHOLOGY\">mythology</a> affixes the origin of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TITANS\">Titans</a>; their abode near Gnoiuss, where stood the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of Rhea; their travels over the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMON\">Ammon</a>, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACCHUS\">Bacchus</a>; the nuptials of Jupiter and Juno, celebrated nigh the river Therenus in Crete; the gods, goddesses, and heroes, who descended from them.\n\nThe most illustrious of those heroes were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOS\">Minos</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHADAMANTHUS\">Rhadamanthus</a>. They are said to have been the sons of Jupiter and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPA\">Europa</a>, who was conveyed into the island on a bull. Minos becoming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, built several cities; the most considerable of which are\u2014Gnoiuss, on that side of the island which faces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, Phocuss on the southern shore, and Cydon on the western, facing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PELOPONNESUS\">Peloponnesus</a>. He gave to his subjects a code of admirable laws, which he pretended to have received from his father Jupiter in the grotto of Mount Ida.\n\nRhadamanthus distinguished himself by the impartiality of his judgments, and by the inflexible severity with which he inflicted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> on the impious and wicked. His empire extended over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> isles of the Archipelago, and the inhabitants of the adjacent coasts of Asia submitted to him on account of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> reputation for probity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. Mythologists have constituted him judge in the regions below, to determine the future state of the righteous and the wicked. They have conferred on him the same honours which were bestowed on Minos, the justest of kings.\n\nThus far have been followed the Cretan traditions as they are related by Diodorus; but historians differ about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of them. There are a variety of opinions concerning the first inhabitants of Crete. Strabo, who has discussed them with great erudition, says, after several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a> on the subject; \"I am not fond of fables; yet I have detailed these at some length, because they are connected with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>. Every discourse concerning the gods should examine the religious opinions of antiquity, and distinguish them from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> were pleased to conceal their knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> under a veil. It is now impossible to unfold the meaning of their enigmas. But by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> the numerous allegories which they have left us, and by examining attentively their mutual relations and differences, genius may perhaps be able to unfold the truths which are couched under them.\"\n\nBut leaving mythology for the more certain records and monuments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, we find that Crete received its name from Ctes, the first of its monarchs. He was author of several useful inventions, which contributed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of his subjects. Prompted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>, they endeavoured to perpetuate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of his favours, and to immortalize his name, by naming the island after him.\n\nIn order to distinguish the true Cretans from strangers, they were named Eteocretes. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>, from different parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, settled in the island. The agreeableness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, and the fertility of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, invited them to fix their habitation there. The Lacedaemonians, Argives, and Athenians, were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> people who sent colonies into Crete. This is what makes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a> say, \"Crete is an extensive island in the midst of the stormy main. The soil is rich and fertile. It contains an immense number of inhabitants. It is adorned with a hundred cities. Its inhabitants speak in various languages. We find there Achaeans, valiant Eteocretes, Cydonians, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DORIANS\">Dorians</a>, and godlike Pelaegians.\" The Eteocretes inhabited the northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the island; they built there the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Proetus, and erected a temple to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIANA\">Diana</a> Jove.\n\nCtes was not the only monarch who reigned in the island of Crete. He had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of successors. But history affords little information concerning them: only the names of a few of them are preserved, and a small number of events which happened under the reign of some others, but blended and disfigured with an intermixture of fable. Among those monarchs we find two Jupiters, and two of the name of Minos. However, most writers confound them, and ascribe to one those transactions and exploits which should be shared between the two.\n\nThis remark chiefly regards Minos, who was esteemed the wisest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a> of antiquity. The office assigned him in the regions below is a clear and certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of his having gained an exalted reputation by his justice. Greece, says <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>, has with great propriety adopted the laws of Crete; for they are founded on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> basis of reason and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a>, and have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> tendency to render the people, who live in subjection to them, opulent and happy. One of those laws forbade \"the Cretans ever to carry their fertility so far as to intoxicate themselves with wine.\" The following was very suitable to repulse the presumptuous ardour of youth: \"Let young people not canvass the laws with an indiscreet curiosity; let them not examine whether the lawgiver has done <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> wrong in promulgating them; but let them join unanimously in declaring them good, since they proceed from the gods. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> any of the old men perceive something\nthing in them meriting amendment, let him mention it to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>, or discuss it with his equals, but never in the presence of the young people.\" That excellent code was engraven on tables of brass; and Talos, chief minister to Minos, visited all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> and cities in the island, three times a-year, to observe in what manner the laws were executed and obeyed. The king of Crete, well knowing that the marvellous is necessary to command the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> and enforce the obedience of the people, pretended that he had received those laws from his father Jupiter, in the grotto of Mount Ida. In the same manner, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LYCURGUS\">Lycurgus</a>, before promulgating his laws, repaired to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DELPHI\">Delphi</a>, and gave out they had received the sanction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a>. A like reason induced Numa to pretend an intimacy with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NYMPH\">nymph</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGERIA\">Egeria</a>, and Mahomet to ascribe his doctrines and institutions to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a> of the angel Gabriel.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> to this account, others of the ancients describe Minos as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> impotently abandoned to the fury of his passions, and a barbarous conqueror. Falling passionately in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> with the nymph Dictynna, who refused to gratify his wishes, he pursued her to the brink of the shore, and forced her to plunge into the sea, where she was saved by some fishermen, who received her in their nets. He was the first of the Greeks who appeared in the Mediterranean at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of a naval armament. He conquered the Cyclades, expelled the Carianians, established Cretan colonies in those islands, and committed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of them to his son.\n\nBeing informed, while he was at Paros, that his son <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ANDROGEUS\">Androgeus</a> was slain at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, he declared war against Egeus, and imposed on him a disgraceful tribute; from the payment of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THESEUS\">Theseus</a> delivered his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. He took arms against Nilus, king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEGARA\">Megara</a>, made him prisoner by the treachery of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCYLLA\">Scylla</a>, and put him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, together with Megarus, the son of Hippomane, who had brought some forces to his assistance. Daedalus, who had by some means incurred his displeasure, despairing of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> from so severe and inflexible a prince, employed the resources of his inventive genius, in order to escape from his power. He fled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, gained the protection of King Cocalus, and obtained an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>. Valerius Flaccus has described his flight in a very lively and picturesque manner. \"Thus Daedalus, with the wings of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a>, ascended from Mount Ida. Beside him flew the comrade of his flight, with shorter wings. They appeared like a cloud rising in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. Minos, seeing his vengeance thus eluded, glowed with impotent rage. In vain he followed with his eyes the secure flight of his enemies through the wide expanse of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>. His guards returned to Gortyna with their quivers filled with arrows.\" The Cretan monarch did not, however, give up his prey. He equipped a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, pursued the fugitive to Sicily, and fell before the walls of Camicum.\n\nIt is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, that those actions cannot agree to the character of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> monarch, whose merits raised him to the office of determining, in the regions below, the unalterable fate of the righteous and the wicked. We may, therefore, reasonably conclude, that Minos the legislator is a different person from the conqueror; that it was the former who gained a lasting reputation by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> and justice; and the latter who subdued most of the islands of the Archipelago, but being enslaved by his passions, tarnished his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> by his cruelty and merciless thirst for vengeance.\n\nThe last king of Crete was Idomeneus. This prince, accompanied by Merion, conducted 24 ships to the assistance of Agamemnon. Homer informs us of the illustrious exploits by which he signalized himself before the walls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a>. At his departure, he committed the government of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> to Leucus his adopted son, promising him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of his daughter Clytthera if he governed wisely in his absence. That ambitious young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> soon forgot the favours which had been so lavishly bestowed on him. Gaining a number of partisans, he in a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> aspired to the immediate possession of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>. His impatience would not wait till he should obtain it lawfully by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>. Flattering himself, from the long absence of the king, that he was perhaps fallen before Troy, he determined to mount the throne. Mida, wife to Idomeneus, and the princess Clytthera, were an obstacle to his wishes. But ambition knows <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> restraint, and tramples under foot the most sacred obligations. The base wretch having seduced the people from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a>, and captivated the affections of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a>, sacrificed those unfortunate victims in the temple. When Idomeneus, crowned with laurels, landed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Crete, Leucus, who had now firmly established his power, attacked him with an armed force, and obliged him to reembark. A different account is also given of the banishment of Idomeneus. Servius says that he had vowed, in a storm, to sacrifice to the gods the first person that his eyes should behold on the Cretan shore; that his son having met him first after his arrival, he fulfilled his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOW\">vow</a>, by sacrificing him; and that the island, being soon after depopulated by pestilence, the inhabitants looked upon that affliction as the effect of divine vengeance, and expelled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARRICIDE\">parricide</a>; who, retiring to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, founded Salentum, on the Messapian coast. But that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> appears entirely groundless. History mentions no son of Idomeneus. If he had a son of his own blood, why did he adopt Leucus? Why did he intrust to him the government of the island, when he promised him his daughter in marriage? The more probable opinion is, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> was introduced into the island by his ships, when he returned from the siege of Troy, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a> asserts; and that Leucus artfully made use of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> to expel his lawful sovereign from the island. But it appears that the usurper did not long enjoy the fruit of his crimes. Soon after the departure of Idomeneus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a> was abolished, and the government of Crete became republican.\n\nThe republic of Crete has been celebrated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PANEGYRIC\">panegyric</a> of Plato, served Lycurgus as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> for that which he established in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LACEDEMON\">Lacedemon</a>, and was beheld by all Greece with respect and admiration. Strabo has thought it not unworthy of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a>, and has consecrated the leading features of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> to lasting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> in his immortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>. It was indeed a system of legislature, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> tendency was to call forth the buds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> in the heart of infancy; to open and expand them in youth; to inspire man, as he reached maturity, with the love of his country, of glory,\nglory, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>; and to comfort and support the infirmities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> with the respect and esteem due to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> and wisdom of that period of life. It laboured to form affectionate friends, patriotic citizens, and worthy magistrates. It made no use, however, of a multitude of acts and statutes to produce those inestimable advantages. They flowed all from one source: the public education of youth, judiciously directed. The virtuous examples set before youth in the course of that education, the illustrious deeds which were recited to them with high applause, the honours conferred on valour and on noble actions, the opprobrium invariably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> on vice; these were the only means which the Cretan lawgiver made use of to form a warlike, humane, and virtuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>.\n\nThe Cretan government, soon after the expulsion of Idomenus, became aristocratical. The power was divided between the nobles and the people. Yet as the chief employments were occupied by the nobles, they directed the administration of affairs. Ten magistrates were annually elected, by a majority of voices, in the national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>. These were named Coi/moi; and their public office and character were the same with those of the Ephori at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPARTA\">Sparta</a>. They were the generals of the republic in time of war, and directed all affairs of any importance. They had the right of choosing certain old men for counsellors. Those old men, to the number of twenty-eight, composed the Cretan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>. They were chosen from among such as had discharged the office of Coi/moi, or had distinguished themselves by extraordinary merit and blameless probity. Those senators <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in office during life, possessed a weighty influence, and were consulted in every affair of any importance. This body was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> opposed by the wisdom of the legislator against the ambition of the ten chief rulers. He had imposed another restraint on their power, by limiting the period of their administration to one year. His foresight went still farther. The suffrages of the people might be obtained by bribery or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> influence, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> their choice might sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> on a man unworthy of so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> an office. When that happened, he who had been undeservedly advanced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of Coi/mos was degraded, either in a national assembly, or simply by the voices of his colleagues. This, doubtless, is what Plato alludes to, when he says, \"Neither the commonwealth, which approaches too near to a monarchical constitution, nor that which affects a licentious liberty, is founded on the solid basis of a just medium between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a> and despotism. O Cretans! O Lacedemonians! by establishing yours on firmer foundations, you have avoided those fatal extremes.\"\n\nSuch were the distribution of power and the administration of public affairs in the Cretan government. Its simplicity was admirable. A people who were blessed with the sacred enjoyment of liberty, but possessed not sufficient knowledge and discernment to direct themselves, elected magistrates, to whom they delegated their authority. Those magistrates, thus arrayed with sovereign power, chose senators to assist and direct their deliberations. These counsellors could neither enact nor decide of themselves; but they held their office for life; and that circumstance contributed to strengthen their influence and to increase their experience. The magistrates were animated by the most powerful motives to distinguish themselves when in office, by unrestrained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> in the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. On one side, they were restrained by the fear of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a>; on the other, actuated by the hope of becoming one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> members of the national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>.","sp":364,"ep":367},{"h":"CREUSA","t":"in fabulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Creon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Corinth.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of this celebrated person's birth is said, by the generality of writers, to have been in 1551; but according to some he was born in August 1560. There is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> likewise between the biographers of this extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, with regard to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and situation of his father. By some it is asserted, that James Crichton's father was Robert Crichton of Clunie, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERTH\">Perth</a>; and that this Robert Crichton commanded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Langside in the year 1568. But it is said by others, that this gentleman was of Elchock in the same county, and that he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> advocate of Scotland in Queen Mary's reign from 1561 to 1573; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of which time he held that office in conjunction with Spens of Condie.

His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> in that university was Mr John Rutherford, a professor at that time famous for his learning, and who distinguished himself by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> four books on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>'s logic and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMENTARY\">commentary</a> on his poetics. According to Aldus Manutius, who calls Crichton first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a> to the king, he was also instructed, along with his majesty, by Buchanan, Hepburn, and Robertson, as well as by Rutherford; and he had scarcely arrived at the 20th year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, when he had run through the whole circle of the sciences, and could speak and write to perfection in ten different languages. Nor was this all; for he had likewise improved himself to the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> in riding, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a> and singing, and in playing upon all sorts of instruments.\n\nCrichton, being thus accomplished, went abroad upon his travels, and is said to have gone to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>; of his transactions at which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> the following account is given. He caused placards to be fixed on all the gates of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>, halls, and colleges belonging to the university, and on all the pillars and posts before the houses of the most renowned men for literature in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, inviting all those who were well versed in any art or science, to dispute with him in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> of Navarre, that day six weeks, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> of the clock in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, where he would attend them, and be ready to answer to whatever should be propounded to him in any art or science, and in any of these 12 languages, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a>, Syrian, Arabic, Greek, Latin, Spanish, French, Italian, English, Dutch, Flemish, and Sclavonian; and this either in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a> or prose, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a> of the disputant. During this whole time, instead of closely applying to his studies, he regarded nothing but hunting, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAWKING\">hawking</a>, tilting, vaulting, riding of a well managed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, toiling the pike, handling the musket, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> feats; or else he employed himself in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> games, such as balls, concerts of music vocal and instrumental, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDS\">cards</a>, dice, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENNIS\">tennis</a>, and the like diversions of youth. This conduct so provoked the students of the university, that, beneath the placard which was fixed on the Navarre gate, they caused the following words to be written: \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> you would meet with this monster of perfection, to make search for him either in the tavern or bawdy-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, is the readiest way to find him.\" Nevertheless, when the day appointed arrived, Crichton appeared in the college of Navarre, and acquitted himself beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> in the disputation, which lasted from nine o'clock in the morning till six at night. At length, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a>, after extolling him highly for the many rare and excellent endowments which God and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> had bestowed upon him, rose from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a>, and accompanied by four of the most eminent professors of the university, gave him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> and a purse full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, as a testimony of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> and favour. The whole ended with the repeated acclamations and huzzas of the spectators; and henceforward our young disputant was called, \"the admirable Crichton.\" It is added, that he was so little fatigued with the dispute, that he went on the very next day to the Louvre, where he had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> of tilting (an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> then in much request), and in the presence of some of the princes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of France, and a great many ladies, carried away the ring 15 times successively.\n\nAbout two years after this we find him at Rome, where he affixed a placard upon all the eminent places of the city, in the following terms; Nos Jacobus Crichtonus Scotus, cuicumque rei propofitio ex improvviso respondimus. In a city which abounded in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>, this bold challenge, to answer to any question that could be propounded to him without his being previously advertised of it, could not escape the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> of a palquinade. It is said, however, that being nowise discouraged, he appeared at the time and place appointed; and that, in the presence of the pope, many cardinals, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, doctors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>, and professors in all the sciences, he displayed such wonderful proofs of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> knowledge, that he excited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less surprize than he had done at Paris. Boccaccini, who was then at Rome, gives something of a different relation\nCrichton. relation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>. According to this author, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASQUINADE\">pasquinade</a> against Crichton, which was to the following effect, \"And he that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> see it, let him go to the sign of the Falcon and it shall be shown,\" made such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> upon him, that he left a place where he had been so grossly affronted as to be put upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with jugglers and mountebanks.\n\nFrom Rome he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>; where he contracted an intimate friendship with Aldus Manutius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAURENTIUS\">Laurentius</a> Maffa, Speron Speroni, Johannes Donatus, and various other learned persons, to whom he presented several poems in commendation of the city and university. At length he was introduced to the doge and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>, in whose presence he made a speech, which was accompanied with such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of eloquence, and such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> of person and manner, that he received the thanks of that illustrious body, and nothing was talked of through the whole city but this rara in terris <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVIS\">avis</a>, this prodigy of nature. He held, likewise, disputations on the subjects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>, philosophy, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, before the most eminent professors, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> multitudes of people. His reputation was so great, that the desire of seeing and hearing him brought together a vast concourse of persons from different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> to Venice. It may be collected from Manutius, that the time in which Crichton exhibited these demonstrations of his abilities was in the year 1580.\n\nDuring his residence at Venice, he fell into a bad state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for the space of four months. However, before he was perfectly recovered, he went, by the advice of his friends, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PADUA\">Padua</a>, the university of which city was at that time in great reputation. The next day after his arrival, there was a meeting of all the learned men of the place, at the house of Jacobus Aloysius Cornelius; when Crichton opened the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> with an extemporary poem in praise of the city, the university, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> who had honoured him with their presence. After this, he disputed for six hours with the most celebrated professors on various subjects of learning; and he exposed, in particular, the errors of Aristotle and his commentators, with so much solidity and acuteness, and at the same time with so much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a>, that he excited universal admiration. In conclusion, he delivered extempore an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORATION\">oration</a> in praise of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, which was conducted with such ingenuity and elegance, that his hearers were astonished. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of Crichton's talents was on the 14th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1581. Soon after he appointed a day for another disputation to be held at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of the bishop of Padua; not for the purpose of affording higher proofs of his abilities, for that could not possibly be done, but in compliance with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> solicitations of some persons who were not present at the former assembly. However, several circumstances occurred which prevented this meeting from taking place. Such is the account of Manutius; but Imperialis relates, that he was informed by his father, who was present upon the occasion, that Crichton was opposed by Archangelus Mercenarius, a famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>; and that he acquitted himself so well as to obtain the approbation of a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> company, and even of his antagonist himself.\n\nAmidst the discourses which were occasioned by our young Scotsman's exploits, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> applause that were bestowed upon his genius and attainments, there were not wanting some who endeavoured to detract from his merit. For ever, therefore, to confound these invidious impugners of his talents, he caused a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> to be fixed on the gates of St John and St Paul's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, wherein he offered to prove before the university, that the errors of Aristotle, and of all his followers, were almost innumerable; and that the latter had failed both in explaining their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>'s meaning, and in treating on theological subjects. He promised likewise to refute the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> of certain mathematical professors; to dispute in all the sciences, and to answer to whatever should be proposed to him or objected against him. All this he engaged to do, either in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> logical way, or by numbers and mathematical figures, or in 100 sorts of verses, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of his opponents. According to Manutius, Crichton sustained this contest, without fatigue, for three days; during which time he supported his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, and maintained his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>, with such spirit and energy, that from an unusual concourse of people, he obtained acclamations and praises, than which none more magnificent were ever heard by men.\n\nFrom Padua, Crichton set out for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANTUA\">Mantua</a>; where there happened to be at the time a gladiator, who had foiled in his travels the most famous fencers in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, and had lately killed three who had entered the lists with him in this city. The duke of Mantua was much grieved at having granted this man his protection, as he found it to be attended with such fatal consequences. Crichton, being informed of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIGHNESS\">highness</a>'s concern, offered his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, not only to drive the murderer from Mantua, but from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>; and to fight him for 1500 pistoles. Though the duke was unwilling to expose such an accomplished gentleman to so great a hazard; yet, relying upon the report he had heard of his warlike achievements, he agreed to the proposal; and the time and place being appointed, the whole court attended to behold the performance. At the beginning of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> Crichton stood only upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>; while the Italian made his attack with such eagerness and fury, that, having overacted himself, he began to grow weary. Crichton now seized the opportunity of attacking his antagonist in return; which he did with so much dexterity and vigour, that he ran him through the body in three different places, of which wounds he immediately died. The acclamations of the spectators were loud and extraordinary upon this occasion; and it was acknowledged by all of them, that they had never seen Art grace Nature, or Nature second the precepts of Art, in so lively a manner as they had beheld these two things accomplished on that day. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, Crichton bestowed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> of his victory upon the widows of the three persons who had lost their lives in fighting with the gladiator.\n\nIt is asserted, that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this and his other wonderful performances, the duke of Mantua made choice of him for preceptor to his son Vincentio di Gonzaga, who is represented as being of a riotous temper and a dissolute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. The appointment was highly pleasing to the court. Crichton, to testify his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> to his friends and benefactors, and to contribute to their diversion, framed, we are told, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMEDY\">comedy</a>, wherein he exposed\nand ridiculed all the weaknesses and failures of the several employments in which men are engaged. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> was regarded as one of the most ingenious satires that ever was made upon mankind. But the most astonishing part of the story is, that Crichton sustained 15 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> in the representation of his own play. Among the rest, he acted the divine, the philosopher, the lawyer, the mathematician, the physician, and the soldier, with such inimitable grace, that every time he appeared on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a> he seemed to be a different person.\n\nFrom being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTOR\">actor</a> in a comedy, Crichton soon became the subject of a dreadful tragedy. One night, during the time of carnival, as he was walking along the streets of Mantua, and playing upon his guitar, he was attacked by half a dozen people in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASKS\">masks</a>. The assailants found that they had no ordinary person to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> with, for they were not able to maintain their ground against him. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>, the leader of the company being disarmed, pulled off his mask, and begged his life, telling him that he was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>'s pupil. Crichton immediately fell upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a> and expressed his concern for his mistake; alleging, that what he had done was only in his own defence, and that if Gonzaga had any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> upon his life, he might always be master of it. Then taking his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> by the point, he presented it to the prince, who immediately received it, and was so irritated by the affront which he thought he had sustained in being foiled with all his attendants, that he instantly ran Crichton through the heart.\n\nVarious have been the conjectures concerning the motives which could induce Vincentio di Gonzaga to be guilty of so ungenerous and brutal an action. Some have ascribed it to jealousy, asserting that he suspected Crichton to be more in favour than himself with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> whom he passionately loved; and Sir Thomas Urquhart has told a story upon this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> which is extravagant and ridiculous in the highest degree. Others, with greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, represent the whole transaction as the result of a drunken frolic: and it is uncertain, according to Imperialis, whether the meeting of the prince and Crichton was by accident or design. However, it is agreed on all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> that Crichton lost his life in this encounter. The time of his decease is said, by the generality of his biographers, to have been in the beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1583; but others fix it to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> in the preceding year. There is a difference, likewise, with regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of life at which Crichton died. The common accounts declare that he was killed in the 32nd year of his age: but Imperialis affirms that he was only in his 22nd year when that calamitous event took place; and this fact is confirmed by other writers.\n\nCrichton's tragic end excited a very great and general lamentation. If Sir Thomas Urquhart is to be credited, the whole court of Mantua went three quarters of a year into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">mourning</a> for him; the epitaphs and elegies that were composed upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> and stuck upon his hearth, would exceed, if collected, the bulk of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>'s works; and, for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time afterwards, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> was to be seen in most of the bedchambers and galleries of the Italian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, representing him on horseback, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANCE\">lance</a> in the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> and a book in the other. The same author tells us, that Crichton gained the esteem of kings and princes, by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a> and knowledge; of noblemen and gentlemen, by his courtliness and breeding; of knights, by his honourable deportment and pregnancy of wit; of the rich, by his affability and good fellowship; of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, by his munificence and liberality; of the old, by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>; of the young by his mirth and gallantry; of the learned, by his universal knowledge; of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, by his undaunted valour and courage; of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> and artificers, by his upright dealing and honesty; and of the fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, by his beauty and handsomeness, in which respect he was a masterpiece of nature.\n\nJoannes Imperialis, in his life of Crichton, says, that he was the wonder of the last age; the prodigious production of nature; the glory and ornament of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARNASSUS\">Parnassus</a>, in a stupendous and unusual manner; and that, in the judgment of the learned world, he was the phoenix of literature, and rather a shining particle of the Divine Mind and Majesty than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of what could be attained by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> industry. The same author, after highly celebrating the beauty of his person, affirms, that his extraordinary eloquence and his admirable knowledge of things testified that he possessed a strength of genius wholly divine. \"What (adds this writer) can more exceed our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a>, than that Crichton, in the 21st year of his age, should be master of ten different languages, and perfectly well versed in philosophy, mathematics, theology, polite literature, and all other sciences? Besides was it ever heard in the whole compass of the globe, that to these extraordinary endowments of the mind, should be added a singular skill in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FENCING\">fencing</a>, dancing, fencing, riding, and in every exercise of the gymnastic art?\" Nay, Imperialis, in his account of Crichton's death, declares, that the report of so sad a catastrophe was spread to the remotest parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; that it disturbed universal nature; and that in her grief for the loss of the wonder she had produced, she threatened never more to confer such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> upon mankind. Compared with these extravagancies, the assertion of Bayle that Crichton was one of the greatest prodigies of wit that ever lived, and the testimony of Felix Aflotius concerning his wonderful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, may be considered as modest encomiums.\n\nSuch are the accounts which, by a succession of writers, and particularly since the time of Mackenzie, have been given of the admirable Crichton. These accounts are indeed so wonderful, that many persons have been disposed to consider them as in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, if not entirely, fabulous. We shall therefore subjoin from the Biographia Britannica the following observations of Dr Kippis, with a view to ascertain what portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> is due to the different parts of the preceding narrative, or at least to assist the reader in forming a proper judgment concerning them.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> begins with observing, \"That no credit can be granted to any facts which depend upon the sole authority of Sir Thomas Urquhart. Mr Pennant indeed speaks of him with approbation; and Dr Samuel Johnson laid a stress on his veracity, in the account of Crichton which he dedicated to Dr Hackettworth, and is inserted in the 8th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the Adventurer; of which account it may be observed, that it is only\nCrichton, an elegant summary of the life written by Mackenzie.\n\nBut with all deference to these respectable names, I must declare my full persuasion that Sir Thomas Urquhart is an author whose testimony to facts is totally unworthy of regard; and it is surprising that a perusal of his works does not strike every mind with this conviction. His productions are so inexplicably absurd and extravagant, that the only rational judgment which can be pronounced concerning him is, that he was little, if at all, better than a madman. To the character of his having been a madman must be added that of his being a liar. Severe as this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> may be thought, I apprehend that a diligent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the treatise which contains the memorials concerning Crichton would show that it is strictly true. But of his total disregard to truth there is incontestable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> in another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of his, entitled, The True Pedigree and Lineal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">Descent</a> of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and honourable Family of the Urquharts in the House of Cromarty, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">Creation</a> of the World until the year of God 1652. In this work it is almost incredible what a number of fallacies he has invented both with respect to names and facts. Perhaps a more flagrant instance of imposture and fiction was never exhibited; and the absurdity of the whole pedigree is beyond the power of words to express. It can only be felt by those who have perused the tract itself. Such a man therefore can justly be entitled to no degree of credit, especially when he has a purpose to serve, as was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with Sir Thomas Urquhart. His design was to exalt his own family and his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> at any rate. With respect to his own nation, there was no occasion for having recourse to fiction, in order to display the lustre of Scotland, in the eminent men whom it has produced in arms and literature. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> of truth alone would have been amply sufficient for that purpose.\n\nSo far therefore as Sir Thomas Urquhart's authority is concerned, the wonderful exhibitions of Crichton at Paris, his triumph at Rome, his combat with the gladiator, his writing an Italian comedy, his fulfilling fifteen characters in the representation of that comedy, the extraordinary story of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMOUR\">amour</a> which is described as the cause of his death, the nine months mourning for him at Mantua, and the poems hung round his heart to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of Homer's works, must be regarded as in the highest degree doubtful, or rather absolutely false. I cannot forbear mentioning two circumstances, which show how much Sir Thomas Urquhart was destitute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, as well as of scrupulousness, in his violations of truth. He says that the duke of Mantua was pleased to confer upon the young lady that was Crichton's mistress and Crichton's future wife, a pension of five hundred ducats a year; and that the prince also bestowed as much upon her during all the days of his life, \"which was (adds Sir Thomas) but short; for he did not long enjoy himself after the cruel fate of so miserable an accident. Now it is well known that Vincenzo di Gonzaga succeeded his father in the dukedom of Mantua in 1587, and that he did not die till the year 1612; which was almost, if not entirely, thirty years after Crichton's decease. The other instance of the imprudence of Sir Thomas Urquhart in the contrivance of his fictions, occurs at the conclusion of his narrative, where he affirms that the verity of the story which he hath related concerning the incomparable Crichton, \"may be certified by two thousand men yet living who have known him.\" Two thousand men yet living! that is, in 1652, sixty-nine or seventy years after Crichton's death, for such was the time of Sir Thomas's publication. Our author would have been sadly puzzled to collect together these two thousand living witnesses who could certify the verity of his story.\n\nWith regard, however, to the account which is given of the prodigious exertions of Crichton, both corporeal and mental, at Paris, Mackenzie imagines that he has found a full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of them in a paillage produced by him from the Disquisitiones of Stephen Palquier, and which he considers as the testimony of an eye-witness. But the whole of what has been built upon it by Mackenzie, and succeeding biographers, is founded on a mistake. In the quotation from the Disquisitiones, the name of Crichton is not mentioned, and the author doth not appear to have been personally present at the exhibitions of the extraordinary youth there described. The expressions which are supposed to carry that meaning may well be referred not to the writer himself, but to his countrymen the French, before whom the young man is said to have displayed his surprising talents. But the disputation of this point is totally needless, because the paillage in question is not an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> authority. The book entitled Stephani Palchieri Disquisitiones is only an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ABRIDGMENT\">abridgment</a> in Latin of Palquier's Des Recherches de la France. Now in this last work there is indeed an account of a wonderful youth, such as is related in Mackenzie's quotation, and from which that paillage was formed. But this wonderful youth, whoever he might be, was not the admirable Crichton; for Palquier, who does not tell his name, expressly says that he appeared in the year 1445. The evidence therefore, produced by Mackenzie falls entirely to the ground. Indeed, if the story of Crichton's exploits at\n\n---\n\n(a) This was probably meant as a satire, and not as a serious production.\n(b) This matter has been set in a clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> by the writer of the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>.\n\n\"Sirs,\n\n\"We are informed by Sir John Hawkins, that Dr. Johnson dictated from memory that account of the person vulgarly named the Admirable Crichton, which is to be found in one of the papers of the Adventurer.\n\n\"That account is plainly an abridgment of the life of Crichton by Dr. George Mackenzie. Dr. Mackenzie supposes that Palquier, the French lawyer and antiquary, was an eye-witness of the feats performed in arts as well as in arms by Crichton. This is one of the grossest errors in biography which has occurred to me in the course of my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a>; and it is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> which I perceive is gaining ground daily, and bids fair in a short time to be received as an indisputable truth.\n\n\"The\nParis had been true, no man was more likely to be acquainted with them than Stephen Pafquier, who lived at the time, and who would be fond enough of recording transactions so extraordinary. It may farther be observed, that Thuanus, who was likewise a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a>, and who in his own life is very particular in what relates to learned men, makes no mention of Crichton. The only authority for his having ever resided in France at all (Sir Thomas Urquhart excepted) is that of Dr John Johnston, who says Gallia pecus excollit. But this amounts to no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the truth of the transactions related by Urquhart. The whole which can be deduced from it is, that Crichton, in the course of his travels, might make some stay in France for the purpose of improvement. Even this, however, doth not agree with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NARRATION\">narration</a> of Imperialis, who informs us, that when troubles arose in Scotland on account of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, and Queen Mary fell into so many calamities, Crichton was sent by his father directly from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> to Venice as a place of security.\n\n\"It is acknowledged by Sir John Hawkins, that Sir Thomas Urquhart has produced no authorities in support of his surprising narrations. But this defect, Sir John thinks, is supplied in the Life of Crichton which is given in Mr Pennant's Tour. I am under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of saying, that this is by no means the case. The article in Pennant was not drawn up by that ingenious and learned gentleman, but is the transcript of a pamphlet, that was printed some years ago at Aberdeen; and which pamphlet is nothing more than a republication, with a few verbal alterations, of the Life of Crichton written by Mackenzie. It doth not, therefore, furnish a single additional testimony in confirmation of Sir Thomas Urquhart's stories, excepting in the mistaken influence from Pafquier. In other respects it only borrows facts from Sir Thomas Urquhart, without establishing them upon fresh proofs. It is observable, that the earlier biographers of Crichton had no knowledge of most of the transactions enlarged upon by this extravagant writer; for if they had known them, they would have been eagerly disposed to relate them, and to do it with every circumstance of exaggeration. How much this was the character of Thomas Dempster, with regard to his own countrymen, is sufficiently understood, and hath frequently been remarked; and yet his account of Crichton is uncommonly modest, compared with those of succeeding authors. The extravagance of Imperialis in respect to Crichton has already appeared. There seems indeed to have been an universal tendency in the writers of this young Scotman's life to produce wonder and astonishment. Mackenzie remarks, that Imperialis could not but know the truth of all, or at least of most of, the things he has related concerning Crichton, since he lived upon the places in which they were transacted, and had them from an eye and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> witness, even his own father. It is, however, to be remembered, that Imperialis's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a> Historicum was not published till 1640, nearly sixty years after the events recorded by him happened; to which may be added, that the information he derived from his father was probably very imperfect. Imperialis the elder was not born till 1568, and consequently was only thirteen years old when Crichton displayed his talents at Padua. What real dependence, therefore, could there be on the accuracy of the account given by a youth of that age? He could only relate, and perhaps from inadequate intelligence, the things which were talked of when he was a boy. Besides, his authority is appealed to for no more than a single fact, and that a doubtful one, since it does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a> with Manutius's narrative: and who ever heard of the famous philosopher Archangelus Mercenarius?\n\n\"The error seems to have arisen from the following circumstance: Dr Mackenzie had never read the original work of Pafquier, entitled Recherches de la France; what he quotes concerning the wonderful young man is taken from a Latin abridgment of that work; he refers to Steph. Pafch. Difquif, lib. v. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 23, and he gives his quotation in Latin; indeed it does not appear that Dr Mackenzie had ever heard of the original work. Now Pafquier, instead of saying that he was an eye-witness of the wonders exhibited by Crichton, says in the most unequivocal terms, that what he relates was taken 'from a manuscript which was occasionally used by him,' ('d'un livre \u00e9crit \u00e0 la main, dont je m' aide selon les occurrences'). And he adds, 'I will represent the story in its own simple garb, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> colouring,' so that my readers may be the more inclined to give credit to it,' ('vous repr\u00e9sentant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CETTE\">cette</a> histoire en sa simplicit\u00e9, sans y apporter aucun fard pour ce que vous y adjoufferez plus de foi'). He then transcribes the narrative from the MS. which places the appearance of this phenomenon in the year 1445, a full century before the birth of our Crichton. See Recherches de la France, lib. vi. c. 38, 39.\n\n\"Dr Mackenzie, although he had not read the original of Pafquier, appears to have read an author who quotes the same story: 'The learned M. du Lauvoy (says he, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of the College of Navarre, finding the history of this dispute recorded in a MS. History of the College of Navarre, and the like account of a Spaniard in Trithemius, confounds the two together, and robs our author of the glory of this action, and places it in the year 1445; whereas it should be in the year 1571.' This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of robbery is singular enough.\n\n\"Let me only add, that Pafquier transcribes some verses written by George Chastelain, a French poet in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> VII. king of France, which allude to the same story; and that Pafquier himself was born at Paris in 1528, passed his life in that city, and was an eminent lawyer and pleader in 1571; so that it is impossible the feats of Crichton, had they been really performed at Paris, could have been unknown to him, and most improbable that, knowing them, he would have omitted to mention them; for, in the same lib. vi. c. 39, he is at pains to produce examples of great proficiency, displayed by men in a much humbler rank of life than that of philosophers and public disputants.\n\n\"I am, &c.\"\nThe truth of the matter is, that, some slight circumstances excepted, neither Dempster nor Imperialis have produced any evidences of Crichton's extraordinary abilities besides those which are recorded by the younger Aldus Manutius. He therefore is to be regarded as the only living authority upon the subject. Manutius was contemporary with Crichton; he was closely connected with him in friendship; and he relates several things on his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> knowledge. He is a positive and undoubted witness with respect to our young Scotman's intellectual and literary exertions at Venice and at Padua; and from him it is that our account of them is given above. Nevertheless, even Aldus Manutius is to be read with some degree of caution. Dedications are apt to assume the style of exaggeration, and this is the case with Manutius's dedication of the *Paradoxa Ciceronis* to Crichton. In addition to the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of such addresses, he might be carried too far by his affection for his friend, which appears to have been very great; nor was the younger Aldus eminent for steadiness and constancy of character. It is even said that by his imprudencies he fell into contempt and misery. But independently of any considerations of this kind, it may be observed, that Manutius's narrative, previous to Crichton's arrival at Venice, could not be derived from personal knowledge. For that part of it (which is sufficiently erroneous) he was probably indebted to Crichton himself. Neither does he appear to have been an eye-witness of the whole of the disputations which were held at Padua; for speaking of his young friend's praise of ignorance, he relates, that those who were present told him afterwards how much they were struck with that oration. However, at the other disputation, which lasted three days, Manutius seems certainly to have attended; for he concludes his accounts of it with saying, that he was not only the adviser but the spectator of Crichton's wonderful contests.\n\nIt is evident, however, from the dedication, that his extraordinary abilities were not universally acknowledged and admired. Some there were who detracted from them, and were displeased with Manutius for so warmly supporting his reputation.\n\nAs to the real cause and manner of our young Scotman's death, both of them still remain in some degree of obscurity. That he was killed in a rencontre at the carnival at Mantua, is testified by too many authors to be reasonably doubted. But whether there was that particular malignity on the part of Vincenzo di Gonzaga, which is commonly ascribed to him, may be considered as uncertain.\n\nOne important method yet remains by which we may be enabled to form a judgment of Crichton's genius, and that is from a perusal of the four poems of his which are still preserved. It is, however, to be feared, that these will not exhibit him in a very high point of view. Some fancy, perhaps, may be thought to be displayed in the longest of his poems, which was written on occasion of his approach to the city of Venice. He there represents a Naiad as rising up before him; and, by the order of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSES\">Muses</a> and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a>, directing him how to proceed. But this is a sentiment which too easily presents itself to a classical reader, that it can scarcely be considered as deserving the name of a poetical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>. The three other poems of Crichton have still less to recommend them. Indeed Crichton's verses will not stand the test of a rigid examination even with regard to quantity.\n\nWhat then is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> which on the whole we are to form of the admirable Crichton? It is evident that he was a youth of such lively parts as excited great present admiration, and high expectations with regard to his future attainments. He appears to have had a fine person, to have been adroit in his bodily exercises, to have possessed a peculiar facility in learning languages, to have enjoyed a remarkably quick and retentive memory, and to have excelled in a power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLAMATION\">declamation</a>, a fluency of speech, and a readiness of reply. His knowledge, likewise, was probably very uncommon for his years; and this, in conjunction with his other qualities, enabled him to shine in public disputation. But whether his knowledge and learning were accurate or profound, may justly be questioned; and it may equally be doubted whether he would have arisen to any extraordinary degree of eminence in the literary world. It will always be reflected upon with regret, that his early and untimely death prevented this matter from being brought to the test of experiment.\"\n\nFrom the portraits which remain of Crichton, it appears that in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> and form he was beautiful and elegant, and that his body and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, though not muscular or athletic, were well proportioned, and fitted for feats of agility.

For <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> or elevation in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, no uprightness of heart, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> or circumspection of conduct, should tempt a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> to conclude, that he may not at some time or other be deeply interested in these researches. The infirmities of the best among us, the vices and ungovernable passions of others, the instability of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> affairs, and the numberless unforeseen events which the compass of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> may bring forth, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> teach us (upon a moment's reflection), that to know with precision what the laws of our country have forbidden, and the deplorable consequences to which a wilful disobedience may expose us, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> concern.\n\nIn proportion to the importance of the criminal law, ought also to be the care and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the legislature in properly forming and enforcing it. It should be founded upon principles that are permanent, uniform, and universal; and always conformable to Crime and Punishment.\n\nAnd yet, either from a want of attention to these principles in the first concoction of the laws, and adopting in their stead the impetuous dictates of avarice, ambition, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a>; or from retaining the discordant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> regulations, which successive conquerors or factions have established, in the various revolutions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>; from giving a lasting efficacy to functions that were intended to be temporary, and made (as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a> expresses it) merely upon the spur of the occasion; or lastly, from too hastily employing such means as are greatly disproportionate to their ends, in order to check the progress of some very prevalent offence; from some, or from all, of these causes, it hath happened, that the criminal law is in every country of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> more rude and imperfect than the civil. We shall not here enter into any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> inquiries concerning the local constitutions of other nations; the inhumanity and mistaken policy of which have been sufficiently pointed out by ingenious writers of their own*. But even with us in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, where our crown-law is with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> supposed to be more nearly Montesquieu advanced to perfection; where crimes are more accurately defined, and penalties less uncertain and arbitrary; where all our accusations are public, and our trials in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the world; where torture is unknown, and every delinquent is judged by such of his equals, against whom he can form no exception, or even a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> dislike;\u2014even here we shall occasionally find room to remark some particulars that seem to want revision and amendment. These have chiefly arisen from too scrupulous an adherence to some rules of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> common law, when the reasons have ceased upon which those rules were founded; from not repealing such of the old penal laws as are either obsolete or absurd; and from too little care and attention in framing and passing new ones. The enacting of penalties to which a whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> shall be subject, ought not to be left, as a matter of indifference, to the passions or interests of a few, who upon temporary motives may prefer or support such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">bill</a>; but be calmly and maturely considered by persons who know what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> the laws have already made to remedy the mischief complained of, who can from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> foresee the probable consequences of those which are now proposed, and who will judge without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> how adequate they are to the evil. It is never usual in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEERS\">peers</a> even to read a private bill which may affect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of an individual, without first referring it to some of the learned judges, and hearing their report thereon. And surely equal precaution is necessary, when laws are to be established which may affect the property, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, and perhaps even the lives of thousands. Had such a reference taken place, it is impossible that in the 18th century it could ever have been made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> crime, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> down (however maliciously) the mound of a fishpond, whereby any fish shall escape; or to cut down a cherry-tree in an orchard. Were even a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> appointed...\nCrime and atrocious injuries the private wrong is swallowed up in the public; we seldom hear any mention made of satisfaction to the individual; the satisfaction to the community being so very great. And indeed, as the public crime is not otherwise avenged than by forfeiture of life and property, it is impossible afterwards to make any reparation for the private wrong; which can only be had from the body or goods of the aggressor. But there are crimes of an inferior nature, in which the public punishment is not so severe, but it affords room for a private compensation also; and herein the distinction of crimes from civil injuries is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>. For instance, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTERY\">battery</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> another, the aggressor may be indicted for this at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> of the king, for disturbing the public peace, and be punished criminally by fine and imprisonment; and the party beaten may also have his private remedy by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of trespass for the injury, which he in particular sustains, and recover a civil satisfaction in damages. So also, in case of a public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NUISANCE\">nuisance</a>, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a> a ditch across a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HIGHWAY\">highway</a>, this is punishable by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDICTMENT\">indictment</a>, as a common offence to the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, and all his majesty's subjects: but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> any individual sustains any special damage thereby, as laming his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, breaking his carriage, or the like, the offender may be compelled to make ample satisfaction, as well for the private injury as for the public wrong.\n\nII. The nature of crimes and misdemeanours in general being thus ascertained and distinguished, we proceed in the next place to consider the general nature of punishments: Which are evils or inconveniences consequent upon crimes and misdemeanours; being devised, denounced, and inflicted by human laws, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of disobedience or misbehaviour in those, to regulate whose conduct such laws were respectively made. And herein we will briefly consider the power, the end, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, of human punishment.\n\nI. As to the power of human punishment, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of the temporal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a> to inflict discretionary penalties for crimes and misdemeanours. It is clear, that the right of punishing crimes against the law of nature, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> and the like, is in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> nature, vested in every individual. For it must be vested in somebody; otherwise the laws of nature would be vain and fruitless, if none were empowered to put them in execution; and if that power is vested in any one, it must also be vested in all mankind; since all are by nature equal. Whereof the first murderer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIN\">Cain</a> was so sensible, that he found him expressing his apprehensions, that whoever should find him would slay him. In a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> this right is transferred from individuals to the sovereign power; whereby men are prevented from being judges in their own causes, which is one of the evils that civil government was intended to remedy. Whatever power therefore individuals had of punishing offences against the law of nature, that is now vested in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> alone; who bears the word of justice by the consent of the whole community. And to this precedent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> power of individuals must be referred that right, which some have argued to belong to every state (though, in fact, never exercised by any), of punishing not only their own subjects, but also foreign ambassadors,\nCrime and ambassadors, even with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> itself; in case they have offended, not indeed against the municipal laws of the country, but against the divine laws of nature, and become liable thereby to forfeit their lives for their guilt.\n\nAs to offences merely against the laws of society, which are only mala prohibita, and not mala in se; the temporal magistrate is also empowered to inflict coercive penalties for such transgression: and this by the consent of individuals; who, in forming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>, did either tacitly or expressly invest the sovereign power with a right of making laws, and of enforcing obedience to them when made, by exercising, upon their non-observance, severities adequate to the evil. The lawfulness, therefore, of punishing such criminals is founded upon this principle, that the law by which they suffer was made by their own consent; it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> into which they entered, when first they engaged in society; it was calculated for, and has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> contributed to, their own security.\n\nThis right therefore, being thus conferred by universal consent, gives to the state exactly the same power, and no more, over all its members, as each individual member had naturally over himself or others; which has occasioned some to doubt, how far a human legislature ought to inflict capital punishments for positive offences; offences against the municipal law only, and not against the law of nature; since no individual has naturally a power of inflicting death upon himself or others for actions in themselves indifferent.\n\nWith regard to offences mala in se, capital punishments are in some instances inflicted by the immediate command of God himself to all mankind; as, in the case of murder, by the precept delivered to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOAH\">Noah</a>, their common ancestor and representative, \"Who sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.\" In other instances they are inflicted after the example of the Creator, in his positive code of laws for the regulation of the Jewish republic; as in the case of the crime against nature. But they are sometimes inflicted without such express warrant or example, at the will and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a> of the human legislature; as for forgery, for theft, and sometimes for offences of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> kind. The practice is thus justified by that great and good man Sir Matthew Hale: \"When offences grow enormous, frequent, and dangerous to a kingdom, or state, destructive or highly pernicious to civil societies, and to the great insecurity and danger of the kingdom or its inhabitants, severe punishment and even death itself is necessary to be annexed to laws in many cases by the prudence of lawgivers.\" It is therefore the enormity, or dangerous tendency, of the crime, that alone can warrant any earthly legislature in putting him to death that commits it. It is not its frequency only, or the difficulty of otherwise preventing it, that will excuse our attempting to prevent it by a wanton <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of human blood. For though the end of punishment is to deter men from offending, it never can follow from thence, that it is lawful to deter them at any rate and by any means; since there may be unlawful methods of enforcing obedience even to the justest laws. Every humane legislator will be therefore extremely cautious of establishing laws that inflict the penalty of death, especially for slight offences, or such as are merely positive. He will expect a better reason for his so doing than that loose one which generally is given; that it is found by former experience that no lighter penalty will be effectual. For is it found upon farther experience, that capital punishments are more effectual? Was the vast territory of all the Russias worse regulated under the late empress <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, than under her more languid predecessors? Is it now, under Catherine II., less civilized, less social, less secure? And yet we are assured, that neither of these illustrious princesses have, throughout their whole administration, inflicted the penalty of death; and the latter has, upon full persuasion of its being useless, nay even pernicious, given orders for abolishing it entirely throughout her extensive dominions. But indeed, were capital punishments proved by experience to be a sure and effectual remedy, that would not prove the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> (upon which the justice and propriety depend) of inflicting them upon all occasions, when other expedients fail. It is feared this reasoning would extend a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> too far. For instance, the damage done to our public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> by loaded waggons is universally allowed, and many laws have been made to prevent it, none of which have hitherto proved effectual. But it does not therefore follow, that it would be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> for the legislature to inflict death upon every obstinate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRIER\">carrier</a>, who defeats or eludes the provisions of former statutes. Where the evil to be prevented is not adequate to the violence of the preventive, a sovereign that thinks seriously can never justify such a law to the dictates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>. To shed the blood of our fellow creature is a matter that requires the greatest deliberation, and the fullest conviction of our own authority; for life is the immediate gift of God to man; which neither he can resign, nor can it be taken from him, unless by the command or permission of Him who gave it, either expressly revealed, or collected from the laws of nature or society by clear and indisputable demonstration.\n\nWe would not be understood to deny the right of the legislature in any country to enforce its own laws by the death of the transgressor, though persons of some abilities have doubted it; but only to suggest a few hints for the consideration of such as are, or may hereafter become, legislators. When a question arises, whether death may be lawfully inflicted for this or that transgression, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> of the laws must decide it: and to this public judgment or decision all private judgments must submit; else there is an end of the first principle of all society and government. The guilt of blood, if any, must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> at their doors, who misinterpret the extent of their warrant; and not at the doors of the subject, who is bound to receive the interpretations that are given by the sovereign power.\n\n2. As to the end, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> cause, of human punishments. This is not by way of atonement or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPIATION\">expiation</a> for the crime committed; for that must be left to the just determination of the Supreme Being; but as a precaution against future offences of the same kind. This is effected three ways: either by the amendment of the offender himself; for which purpose all corporal punishments, fines, and temporary exile or imprisonment, are inflicted; or, by deterring others by the dread of his example from offending in the like manner, \"ut pana (as Tully expresses it) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a> paucos, me-\nCrime and \"tus ad omnes, proventatis,\" which gives rise to all ignominious punishments, and to such executions of justice as are open and public; or, lastly, by depriving the party injuring of the power to do future mischief; which is effected by either putting him to death, or condemning him to perpetual confinement, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>, or exile. The same end, of preventing future crimes, is endeavoured to be answered by each of these three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of punishment. The public gains equal security, whether the offender himself be amended by wholesome correction, or whether he be disabled from doing any farther harm; and if the penalty fails of both these effects, as it may do, still the terror of his example remains as a warning to other citizens. The method, however, of inflicting punishment ought always to be proportioned to the particular purpose it is meant to serve, and by no means to exceed it; therefore the pains of death, and perpetual disfability by exile, slavery, or imprisonment, ought never to be inflicted, but when the offender appears incorrigible: which may be collected either from a repetition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> offences; or from the perpetration of some one crime of deep malignity, which of itself demonstrates a disposition without hope or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> of amendment: and in such cases it would be cruelty to the public to defer the punishment of such a criminal till he had an opportunity of repeating perhaps the worst of villainies.\n\n3. As to the measure of human punishments. From what has been observed in the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>, we may collect, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of punishment can never be absolutely determined by any standing invariable rule; but it must be left to the arbitration of the legislature to inflict such penalties as are warranted by the laws of nature and society, and such as appear to be the best calculated to answer the end of precaution against future offences.\n\nHence it will be evident, that what some have so highly extolled for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a>, the lex talionis, or \"law of retaliation,\" can never be in all cases an adequate or permanent rule of punishment. In some cases indeed it seems to be dictated by natural reason; as in the case of conspiracies to do an injury, or false accusations of the innocent; to which we may add that law of the Jews and Egyptians, mentioned by Josephus and Diodorus Siculus, that whoever without sufficient cause was found with any mortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> in his custody, should himself be obliged to take it. But, in general, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of persons, place, time, provocation, or other circumstances, may enhance or mitigate the offence; and in such cases retaliation can never be a proper measure of justice. If a nobleman strikes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a>, all mankind will see, that if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of justice awards a return of the blow, it is more than a just compensation. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, retaliation may sometimes be too easy a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>; as, if a man maliciously should put out the remaining eye of him who had lost one before, it is too slight a punishment for the maimer to lose only one of his; and therefore the law of the Locrians, which demanded an eye for an eye, was in this instance judiciously altered; by decreeing, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of Solon's laws, that he who struck out the eye of a one-eyed man, should lose both his own in return. Besides, there are very many crimes, that will in no shape admit of these penalties, without manifest absurdity and wickedness. Theft cannot be punished by theft, defamation by defamation, forgery by forgery, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADULTERY\">adultery</a> by adultery, and the like. And we may add, that those instances, wherein retaliation appears to be used, even by the divine authority, do not really proceed upon the rule of exact retribution, by doing to the criminal the same hurt he has done to his neighbour, and no more; but this correspondence between the crime and punishment is barely a consequence from some other principle. Death is ordered to be punished with death; not because one is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to the other, for that would be expiation, and not punishment. Nor is death always an equivalent for death: the execution of a needy decrepid assasin is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> satisfaction for the death of a nobleman in the bloom of his youth, and full enjoyment of his friends, his honours, and his fortune. But the reason upon which this sentence is grounded seems to be, that this is the highest penalty that man can inflict, and tends most to the security of the world: by removing one murderer from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and setting a dreadful example to deter others: so that even this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> instance proceeds upon other principles than those of retaliation. And truly, if any measure of punishment is to be taken from the damage sustained by the sufferer, the punishment ought rather to exceed than equal the injury; since it seems contrary to reason and equity, that the guilty (if convicted) should suffer no more than the innocent has done before him; especially as the suffering of the innocent is past and irrevocable, that of the guilty is future, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINGENT\">contingent</a>, and liable to be escaped or evaded. With regard indeed to crimes that are incomplete, which consist merely in the intention, and are not yet carried into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, as conspiracies and the like; the innocent has a chance to frustrate or avoid the villany, as the conspirator has also a chance to escape his punishment: and this may be one reason why the lex talionis is more proper to be inflicted, if at all, for crimes that consist in intention, than for such as are carried into act. It seems indeed consonant to natural reason, and has therefore been adopted as a maxim by several theoretical writers, that the punishment, due to the crime of which one falsely accuses another, should be inflicted on the perfidious informer. Accordingly, when it was once attempted to introduce into England the law of retaliation, it was intended as a punishment for such only as preferred malicious accusations against others; it being enacted by statute 37 Edw. III. c. 18, that such as preferred any suggestions to the king's great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> should put in forfeitures of talion; that is, to incur the same pain that the other should have had, in case the suggestion were found untrue. But, after one year's experience, this punishment of talion was rejected, and imprisonment adopted in its stead.\n\nBut though from what has been said it appears, that there cannot be any regular determinate method of rating the quantity of punishments for crimes, by any one uniform rule; but they must be referred to the will and discretion of the legislative power: yet there are some general principles, drawn from the nature and circumstances of the crime, that may be of some assistance in allotting it an adequate punishment.\n\nAs, first, with regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of it: for the greater and more exalted the object of an injury is,\nCrime and Punishment\n\nCrime and the more care should be taken to prevent that injury, and of course under this aggravation the punishment should be more severe. Therefore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a> in conspiring the king's death is (in Britain) punished with greater rigour than even actually killing any private subject. And yet, generally, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to transgress is not so flagrant an enormity as the actual completion of that design. For evil, the nearer we approach it, is the more disagreeable and shocking; so that it requires more obstinacy in wickedness to perpetrate an unlawful action, than barely to entertain the thought of it: and it is an encouragement to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPENTANCE\">repentance</a> and remorse, even till the last stage of any crime, that it never is too late to retract; and that if a man stops even here, it is better for him than if he proceeds: for which reason an attempt to rob, to ravish, or to kill, is far less penal than the actual robbery, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAPE\">rape</a>, or murder. But in the case of a treasonable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a>, the object whereof is the king's majesty, the bare intention will deserve the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of severity: not because the intention is equivalent to the act itself; but because the greatest rigour is no more than adequate to a treasonable purpose of the heart, and there is no greater left to inflict upon the actual execution itself.\n\nAgain, The violence of passion, or temptation, may sometimes alleviate a crime; as theft, in case of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>, is far more worthy of compassion, than when committed through avarice, or to supply one in luxurious excesses. To kill a man upon sudden and violent resentment is less penal than upon cool deliberate malice. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, and character, of the offender; the repetition (or otherwise) of the offence; the time, the place, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> wherein it was committed; all these, and a thousand other incidents, may aggravate or extenuate the crime.\n\nFarther, As punishments are chiefly intended for the prevention of future crimes, it is but reasonable that among crimes of different natures those should be most severely punished, which are the most destructive of the public safety and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>; and, among crimes of an equal malignity, those which a man has the most frequent and easy opportunities of committing, which cannot be so easily guarded against as others, and which therefore the offender has the strongest inducement to commit: according to what Cicero observes, *Ea sunt animadvertenda peccata maxime, quae difficillime praecaveri*. Hence it is, that for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> to rob his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> is in more cases capital than for a stranger. If a servant kills his master, it is a species of treason; in another it is only murder. To steal a handkerchief, or other trifle of above the value of twelvepence, privately from one's person, is made capital; but to carry off a load of corn from an open field, though of fifty times greater value, is punished with transportation only. And in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Man this rule was formerly carried so far, that to take away a horse or an ox was there no felony, but a trespass, because of the difficulty in that little territory to conceal them or carry them off: but to steal a pig or a fowl, which is easily done, was a capital misdemeanor, and the offender was punished with death.\n\nLastly, As a conclusion to the whole, we may observe, that punishments of unreasonable severity, especially when indiscriminately inflicted, have less effect in preventing crimes, and amending the manners of a people, than such as are more merciful in general, yet properly intermixed with due distinctions of severity. It is the sentiment of an ingenious writer, who seems to have well studied the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> of human action, that crimes are more effectually prevented by the certainty than by the severity of punishment; for the excessive severity of laws (says Montesquieu) hinders their execution. When the punishment surpasses all measure, the public will frequently prefer impunity to it. Thus also the statute 1 Mar. st. 1 c. 1 recites in its preamble, \"that the flate of every king consists more affinely in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of the subjects towards their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, than in the dread of laws made with rigorous pains; and that laws made for the preservation of the commonwealth without great penalties, are more often obeyed and kept than laws made with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> punishments.\" Happy had it been for the nation if the subsequent practice of that deluded princess in matters of religion, had been correspondent to these sentiments of herself and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> in matters of state and government! We may further observe, that sanguinary laws are a bad symptom of the distemper of any state, or at least of its weak <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>. The laws of the Roman kings, and the twelve tables of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMVIRI\">decemviri</a>, were full of cruel punishments: the Porcian law, which exempted all citizens from sentence of death, silently abrogated them all. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> the republic flourished: under the emperors severe punishments were revived, and then the empire fell.\n\nIt is, moreover, absurd and impolitic to apply the same punishment to crimes of different malignity. A multitude of sanguinary laws, (besides the doubt that may be entertained concerning the right of making them) do likewise prove a manifest defect either in the wisdom of the legislative, or the strength of the executive, power. It is a kind of quackery in government, and argues a want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> skill, to apply the same universal remedy, the *ultimum supplicium*, to every case of difficulty. It is, it must be owned, much easier to extirpate than to amend mankind; yet that magistrate must be esteemed both a weak and a cruel surgeon who cuts off every limb which through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> or indolence he will not attempt to cure. It has been therefore ingeniously proposed, that in every state a scale of crimes should be formed, with a corresponding scale of punishments, descending from the greatest to the least. But if that be too romantic an idea, yet at least a wise legislator will mark the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> divisions, and not assign penalties of the first degree to offences of an inferior rank. Where men see no distinction\n\n(a) Thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMOSTHENES\">Demosthenes</a> (in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORATION\">oration</a> against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIDAS\">Midas</a>) finely works up the aggravations of the insults he had received. \"I was abused (says he) by my enemy, in cold blood, out of malice, not by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of wine, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, publicly, before strangers as well as citizens; and that in the temple, whither the duty of my office called me.\"\nCrime and Punishment made in the nature and gradations of punishment, the generality will be led to conclude there is no distinction in the guilt. Thus in France the punishment of robbery, either with or without murder, is the same; hence it is, that though perhaps they are therefore subject to fewer robberies, yet they never rob but they also murder. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MURDERERS\">murderers</a> are cut to pieces, and robbers not; hence in that country they never murder on the highway, though they often rob. And in Britain, besides the additional terrors of a speedy execution, and a subsequent exposure or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISLOCATION\">dislocation</a>, robbers have a hope of transportation, which seldom is extended to murderers. This has the same effect here as in China, in preventing frequent afflatusion and slaughter.\n\nYet though in this instance we may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> in the wisdom of our law, we shall find it more difficult to justify the frequency of capital punishment to be found therein; inflicted (perhaps inattentively) by a multitude of successive independent statutes, upon crimes very different in their natures. It is a melancholy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, that, among the variety of actions which men are daily liable to commit, no less than 160 have been declared by act of parliament to be felonies without benefit of clergy; or, in other words, to be worthy of instant death. So dreadful a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a>, instead of diminishing, increases the number of offenders. The injured, through compassion, will often forbear to prosecute; juries, through compassion, will sometimes forget their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a>, and either acquit the guilty or mitigate the nature of the offence; and judges, through compassion, will reprieve one half of the convicts, and recommend them to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> mercy. Among so many chances of escaping, the needy and hardened offender overlooks the multitude that suffer; he boldly engages in some desperate attempt to relieve his wants or supply his vices; and if, unexpectedly, the hand of justice overtakes him, he deems himself peculiarly unfortunate in falling at last a sacrifice to those laws which long impunity has taught him to contemn.\n\nAs to the trials and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of punishment, see Assignment; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">Trial</a>, and the references therefrom; Conviction; Judgment; Attainder; Corruption of Blood; Forfeiture; Execution; the several Crimes under their respective names. See Law <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>.\n\nPersons capable or incapable of committing Crimes; or (which is all one) of suffering the censures of the law upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of forbidden acts.\n\nAll the several pleas and excuses which protect the committer of a forbidden act from the punishment which is otherwise annexed thereto, may be reduced to this single consideration, the want or defect of will. An involuntary act, as it has no claim to merit, so neither can it induce any guilt; the concurrence of the will, when it has its choice either to do or to avoid the fact in question, being the only thing that renders human actions either praiseworthy or culpable. Indeed, to make a complete crime, cognizable by human laws, there must be both a will and an act. For though, in foro conscientiae, a fixed design or will to do an unlawful act is almost as heinous as the commission of it; yet as no temporal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a> can search the heart, or fathom the intentions of the mind, otherwise than as they are demonstrated by outward actions, it therefore cannot punish for what it cannot know. For which reason, in all temporal jurisdictions, an overt act, or some open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of an intended crime, is necessary in order to demonstrate the depravity of the will, before the man is liable to punishment. And as a vicious will without a vicious act is no civil crime; so, on the other hand, an unwarrantable act without a vicious will is no crime at all. So that to constitute a crime against human laws, there must be, first, a vicious will; and, secondly, an unlawful act consequent upon such vicious will.\n\nNow there are three cases in which the will does not join with the act; 1. When there is a defect of understanding. For where there is no discernment, there is no choice; and, where there is no choice, there can be no act of the will, which is nothing else but a determination of one's choice to do or abstain from a particular action; he, therefore, that has no understanding, can have no will to guide his conduct. 2. Where there is understanding and will sufficient residing in the party, but not called forth and exerted at the time of the action done; which is the case of all offences committed by chance or ignorance. Here the will fits neater, and neither concurs with the act nor disagrees to it. 3. Where the action is constrained by some outward force and violence. Here the will counteracts the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a>; and is so far from concurring with, that it loathes and disagrees to what the man is obliged to perform. Infancy, idiocy, lunacy, and intoxication, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> under the first class; misfortune and ignorance may be referred to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>; and compulsion or necessity may properly rank in the third.

Its southern and western coasts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> on the Euxine, its northern and eastern on the Rotten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> and the Palus Maeotis. It is joined, however, to the continent on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> by a small neck of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> not more than six miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>. This peninsula has been known more than 3000 years since the first naval expedition of the Argonauts; a story, though mixed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a>, yet well founded in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> facts. The mountainous parts were inhabited by the Tauri, probably a colony of Scythians; and its coasts on the west, the east, and the south, by Greeks. The Scythians were driven out by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MITHRIDATES\">Mithridates</a>; the Greeks by the Sarmatians; and these again by the Alanis and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHS\">Goths</a>, a northern horde of Scythians. The Hungarians, the Cossacks, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a>, succeeded in their turn; while the Genoese in the 12th century, held a temporary and precarious possession of the ports, which they were obliged to yield to the Turks in 1475. At the peace of 1774, the Tartars of the Crimea were declared independent; and in 1783, this peninsula was united to the Russian empire.\n\nFrom the above-mentioned isthmus, on which is built the fortress of Or-kapi or Perekop, to the first rising of the hill at Karasubazar, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> flat; elevating itself, by an easy gradation, to the summit of the hill, which forms the south side of the peninsula and the shore of the Euxine sea. The surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is almost all of one kind, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISH\">dish</a>-gray loam; on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a>, you find it more or less mixed.\nmixed with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and the hills abound with marle. The whole flat from Perekop to the river Salgir, which may be an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of 80 miles, is full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> marshes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>; from whence the neighbouring Russian governments, as well as the Crime itself, Anatolia, and Bessarabia, are supplied with salt. The most remarkable of these lakes are five in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>; Kolof and Kefia, so called after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> near which they lie, are very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>; the Tulla, about 15 versts from Perekop, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> from Kefia; the Red lake, not far from the last mentioned; and the Black lake. Besides these, there are many other swamps and lakes, from whence the inhabitants get salt for their own consumption.\n\nThe greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the peninsula is so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> may travel over the half of it without meeting with a river, or even the smallest brook. The inhabitants of the villages, therefore, make a pit in the yard of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> for receiving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> that runs from the hills. The whole tract is bare of every kind of tree. Not a bush or a bramble is to be seen, and the herbage is extremely scanty. This, however, does not proceed too much from the unfruitfulness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, as from the vast herds of cattle which rove the whole year <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> from place to place; by which means all the grass in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, or autumn, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> sooner appears through the long drought which succeeds the rainy season, but it is immediately devoured or trodden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> prevalence of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of keeping cattle to wander up and down, joined to the slothfulness of the Tartars, with their inaptitude and aversion to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, is the reason of the total neglect of that science here. Otherwise, were the land divided into portions and properly managed, there would be a sufficiency for the cattle, and the rest would be fruitful in corn and grain. By this means alone the Crime would become a fertile country, and no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> defect would be found in opposition to the welfare of its inhabitants. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of this is well known by their neighbours; where, of a hundred Tartars, one perhaps follows husbandry, who finds it to answer to so much profit, that he has not only enough for his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, but wherewith to sell to the ninety-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a>.\n\nThis peninsula, which is indeed but a little district, yet, from the many advantages conferred upon it by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, may be esteemed peculiarly rich, is divided into the hilly country and the flat. The latter, which extends from Perekop to Kolof, and the river Bulganak, to Karatubalar, Kefia, and Yenicali, is thrown there and there with little Tartar villages, maintained by cattle and the produce of the salt lakes. The highlands, or hilly country, form the southern part of the Crime, along the straight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK_SEA\">Black sea</a>, and stretching westward in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> line from Kefia to the vicinity of Belbek. These hills are composed of layers of chalk; which, in the headlands and promontories, is soft, but more inland quite hard. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> hills are like those of the promontories, and take a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> from north to south. These qualities of the strata prevail not throughout the whole hills, but only in the large and lofty ones; such as the two that rise near Karatubalar, and one very high by Achmetchek, which bears the name of Aktau. The other smaller hills lie scattered and dispersed, but take the names of the greater ones, to which they seem to belong; as the great ridge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAUCASUS\">Caucasus</a> does, which extends beyond the Donau, through Bulgaria, and are named Palkons.\n\nAll accounts agree in this, that nature has favoured these highland countries with great advantages, and blest them with abundance of all things. A number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> that flow from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> form the two considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> Salgir and Karasu, which run into the Rotten sea. The former, which takes its rise from a cavern in a high hill near Achmetchek, falls straight into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> below, and waters a great part of the Crime; the other commencing behind Karatubalar, falls likewise into the plain, and mingles with the Salgir. There are many other little rivers and streams, which run eastward, and either join the two fore-mentioned or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> immediately into the Rotten sea. All the streams, for the whole length of the hills, which begin at Kefia, and proceed in a chain of the same height, flow to the north or the north-east, excepting the one behind Achmetchek, where the great mountain Aktau is, which falls on the other side; this river, rising on the northern side of this mountain, flows, as was before observed, towards the north-east, to the Salgir and the Rotten sea; as likewise those which spring on the western side, take their course westward to the Bulganak, and thence straight to the Black sea; which also receives all the other little rivers that arise from these hills, as the Amma, the Katseba, the Belbek, the Kafulkioi, &c.\n\nThe mountains are well covered with woods fit for the purpose of ship-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, and contain plenty of wild beasts. The valleys consist of fine arable land; on the sides of the hills grow corn and vines in great abundance, and the earth is rich in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>. But these mountaineers are as careless and negligent as the inhabitants of the deserts; slighting all these advantages; and, like their brethren of the lowlands, are sufficiently happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they are in possession of a fat sheep and as much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> as serves them to eat.\n\nAbout 20 years ago this peninsula was uncommonly full of inhabitants and wealth. They reckoned at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> at least 1200 villages; but, from the late troubles in the Crime, it has lost more than a third part of its inhabitants, and now, wherever we turn, we meet with the ruins of large villages and dwellings. The people were composed of various nations, who lived together under the Tartars in the most unbounded freedom; but in the late Turkish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> they either put themselves under the Russian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, and were transferred to that empire, or fled to Abcasia and the Tchirkassian hills.\n\nThe houses in the towns, as well as the villages, are for the most part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> timbers, having the interstices filled with brick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, if the possessor can afford it, and those of the poorer sort with turf. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIMNEYS\">chimneys</a> and crannies are made tight with clay, and then plastered within and without. The covering is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> either of bricks or of turtledoves. Only the medjeheds, minarets, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a>, are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, and a few extremely handsome of marble. They have chimneys in the chambers, at which they likewise dress their viands; but stoves in the Russian manner none. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> frosts a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAN\">pan</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> is brought into the room, for making it comfortable. Their custom is,\nCrimea. to fit upon low sofas, with Turkish coverings and cushions, or upon a clay seat, somewhat raised above the earth, and spread with a carpet. In these rooms are cupboards and chests, often covered with cushions, to serve as seats; in which they keep their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, silver, and valuables. Such are the inner apartments or harams, in which the women generally live; the others are not so fine. These contain only a sofa, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of clay covered with a carpet, as in the chimney rooms.\n\nThe rich Tartars, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> or murzas (excepting only such as are about the person of the khan), commonly dwell all the year round in the country, coming only to town when they have business there. There are but few towns in the Crim, at least in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of its former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>. The Krimkoi Tartars have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, controversies and quarrels being seldom heard of among them; and if a dispute should arise, it is immediately settled by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to the Koran. Little differences in the villages inevitably happening about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, or other matters, not taken notice of in that code, are amicably adjusted by the elderman or abes; but in the towns all weighty concerns, excepting the single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOMICIDE\">homicide</a>, are brought before the kaimakan, or commandant, who settles them absolutely without appeal.\n\nThe residence of the khans of the Crimea was formerly Bachtchisarai, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> they held their seat for upwards of 200 years. They went thither from Eski-Crim, or Old Crim, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> city of the Genoese, upon Bengli Ghirei Khan's plundering the seaports, and driving all the Genoese from their stations. Before Eski-Crim, and indeed upon the first coming of the Tartars into this peninsula, the sovereign residence was at Kolof; but here they remained not long. Under the late Khan Shagin Ghirei it was held at Kefla, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Theodofia; which is ten miles distant from Eski-Crim, said to be the Cimmerium of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>.\n\nThe principal cities or towns of the Crimea are:\n\n1. Bachtchisarai, an extensive and wealthy city, lying in a vale between two high mountains, and surrounded by a number of gardens. From this circumstance it has its name; bachtchis, signifying in the Tartarian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> \"a garden,\" and sarai, \"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>.\" It formerly contained 3000 houses, and many sumptuous medicheds. The palace of the khans, with its gardens and ponds, was much improved under the government of Khan Kerim Ghirei, under whose government the last Turkish war took its rise. In this palace is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURIAL\">burial</a>-place of all the khans of Crimea, wherein all the khans that have reigned here lie interred. The fine Krimkoi vines, with their large clusters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a>, grow in great plenty all about this town, and a profusion of other delicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, from whence the neighbouring parts of Russia are supplied.\n\n2. Kefla, the present residence of the khans, stands on the shore of a large harbour in the Black Sea. Its site is on the declivity of a long ridge of mountains; and is mantled by a stone wall, fortified by several towers, and encompassed by a deep ditch. On both sides of the city formerly stood castles, and in the middle of them a lofty turret for the purpose of giving signals by fire. Before the wall were wide extended suburbs; containing among other considerable buildings, medicheds, churches for the Greek and Armenian worship; of all which now only the vestiges remain. The castles and towers lie also in ruins; and not one-third part of the houses of the city itself are now remaining, and those chiefly built of materials taken from the aforesaid ruins. They formerly reckoned Kefla to contain 4000 houses, including the suburbs, with a number of medicheds and Christian churches; but this number has been much diminished by the last Turkish war. The present inhabitants consist mostly of Tartars; who carry on a trade by no means inconsiderable, in commodities brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a>. The late khan, an intelligent and enlightened personage, made this city the place of his residence, and brought hither the mint from Bachtchisarai, built himself a palace, and erected a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVAN\">divan</a>, which assembled three times a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, and the fourth time was held in the palace of the khan, in which he always personally assisted. Here is also a customhouse, the management of which is farmed out.\n\n3. Karafulafar, likewise a very rich city in former times, stands at the beginning of the mountains, about half-way between Kefla and Bachtchisarai. It is a large trading town; contains a considerable number of dwelling-houses and medicheds, but the greatest part of them in decay, and many fine gardens. This place is the most famous in all the Crim for its trade in horses, and has a market once a week for that article of traffic; to which are likewise brought great numbers of buffaloes, oxen, cows, camels, and sheep for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>. Near this city flows one of the principal rivers of the Crim, called the Karafula, that is, the Black Water. Of this river they have an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> in Russia, that one part of it flows upwards for several versts together. But this is in some fort true, not only of the Karafula, but of all the rivers of the Crim that have a strong current. The Tartars, who dwell either in the valleys or on the sides of the mountains (frequently without considering whether the place is supplied with water or not), dig <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> either from the source of the next river, or from that part of it which lies nearest to their particular habitation, about an arshin in breadth, for their gardens and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> use. From these they cut smaller ones through the villages, to supply them with water, and not unfrequently to drive a mill. These canals appear, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> people, to run in a contrary direction to the current of the river; and in fact these canals do lie, in many places for a verst in length, some fathoms higher than the level of the stream from whence they are supplied.\n\n4. Akhtifled, a pretty large city not far from Bachtchisarai; now made the capital of all the Crimea by the regulations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> Potemkin in the summer of 1785.\n\n5. Kolof, formerly a very considerable trading town, lies on the western side of the peninsula, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of the Black Sea; which, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> at Kefla, might rather be called a road than a haven. This was the first town the Tartars possessed themselves of on their first entrance into the Crim, and established a customhouse therein, after the example of the Genoese, which is now farmed out.\n\nThe other remarkable places are, Sudak, which is built on the hills upon the shore of the Black Sea, at the south side of the peninsula, and is famous for its excellent wine, resembling Champagne both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> and strength; Alusht, on the same side, among the hills.\nCrimea hills on the sea shore; Balaklava, where there is a fine harbour, and perhaps the only one on the Black Sea, containing ample room for a very good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>; Inkerman may be noticed for its commodious though not very large haven, called Achtiar; and Mangup, the old Chersonesus: which were all formerly very flourishing towns; but are now either in ruins, or dwindled into small villages.\n\nAll these places, so long as the Genoese remained masters of the Crim, were well fortified; but the Tartars, in taking them, demolished all the works. While they were under the Turks, they left the fortresses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KAFFA\">Kaffa</a>, Kerch, and Kaffa, and built the fort Arabat on the neck of land between the sea of Azof (or Palus Maeotis) and the Rotten sea, where Perekop also is.\n\nIn Arabat are but few houses; but here the warlike stores of the khans were kept.\u2014Perekop, called by the Turks Or-kapi, is a fortress of moderate strength; standing about the middle of the neck of land that joins the peninsula with the continent. This isthmus, which is at least five miles broad, is cut through with a wide and deep ditch lined with stone, and reaches from the Black to the Rotten sea. This was formerly kept without water, but now is filled from both seas. On the Crimean side a high wall of earth runs the whole length of it, straight from one sea to the other. The people <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> over the ditch by means of a drawbridge, and through the wall by a gateway. The walls of the fortresses are some fathoms from the road side; of which the ruins are only now discernible, namely, large brick houses, with a number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOMB\">bomb</a>-shells and cannon-balls about them, which were formerly kept in the fortresses. At least two miles from this is a pretty populous but miserable place, which was probably the town to which this fort belonged. Near the gate is a customhouse, where all imports and exports pay duty.\n\nThis peninsula was formerly extremely populous; the number of its inhabitants, in Tartars, Turks, Greeks, Armenians, Jews, and others, amounted to above 200,000 men. Since that, however, the greatest part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> have betaken themselves to the other parts of the Russian empire, particularly the government of Azof; and many other inhabitants, particularly Tartars, have gone to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TAMAN\">Taman</a> and Abchasia; so that the present population of the Crim cannot now be reckoned at more than 70,000 men at most.\n\nThe Crim was heretofore divided into 24 kadiukis or districts; namely, Yenikali, Kerch, Arabat, Eski-krim, Kaffa, Karabukhara, Sudak, Achmetchek, Yalof, Bachtchisarai, Balaklava, Mangup, Inkerman, Kaffa, Or, Manfur, Tarkan, Sivach, Tichongar, Sarubulat, Barun, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARGUN\">Argun</a>, Sidchugut, and Schirin. Several of these districts are named after the town or village wherein the murza, their governor, dwells; and many of them are at present in a state of total decay.\n\nCRIMEN FALSI.

But, in a more limited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, the science of criticism is confined to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FINE_ARTS\">fine arts</a>. The principles of the fine arts are best unfolded by studying the sensitive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and by learning what objects are naturally agreeable and what are naturally disagreeable. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> who aspires to be a critic in these arts, must pierce still deeper; he must clearly perceive what objects are lofty, what low, what are proper or improper, what are manly, and what are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> or trivial. Hence a foundation for judging of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, and for reasoning upon it: where it is conformable to principles, we can pronounce with certainty that it is correct; otherwise, that it is incorrect, and perhaps whimsical.

In the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, a thorough acquaintance with the principles of the fine arts redoubles the entertainments those arts afford. To the man who resigns himself entirely to sentiment or feeling, without interfering any sort of judgment, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, music, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASTIME\">pastime</a>; in the prime of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, indeed, they are delightful, being supported by the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>: but they lose their relish gradually with their novelty; and are generally neglected in the maturity of life, which disposes to more serious and more important occupations. To those who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> in criticism as a regular science, governed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> principles, and giving scope to judgment as well as to fancy, the fine arts are a favourite entertainment; and in old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> maintain that relish which they produce in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of life.\n\nIn the next place, a philosophical inquiry into the principles of the fine arts, injures the reflecting mind to the most enticing sort of logic: the practice of reasoning upon subjects so agreeable tends to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>; and a habit strengthening the reasoning faculties, prepares the mind for entering into subjects more difficult and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a>. To have, in this respect, a just <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of the importance of criticism, we need but reflect upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>; which, after some years spent in acquiring languages, hurries us, without the least preparatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>, into the most profound <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>: a more effectual method to alienate the tender mind from abstract science, is beyond the reach of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>: and accordingly, with respect to such speculations, the bulk of our youth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> a sort of hobgoblin terror, which is seldom, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> ever, subdued. Those who apply to the arts are trained in a very different manner: they are led, step by step, from the easier parts of the operation to what are more difficult; and are not permitted to make a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> till they are perfected in those which regularly precede it. The science of criticism appears then to be a middle link, connecting the different parts of education into a regular chain. This science furnishes an inviting opportunity to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> the judgment: we delight to reason upon subjects that are equally pleasant and familiar; we proceed gradually from the simpler to the more involved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>: and in a due course of discipline, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, which improves all our faculties, bestows acuteness upon those of reason, sufficient to unravel all the intricacies of philosophy.\n\nNor ought it to be overlooked, that the reasonings employed upon the fine arts are of the same kind with those which regulate our conduct. Mathematical and metaphysical reasonings have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> tendency to improve social intercourse; nor are they applicable to the common affairs of life: but a just taste in the fine arts, derived from rational principles, furnishes elegant subjects for conversation, and prepares us finely for acting in the social state with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> and propriety.\n\nThe science of rational criticism tends to improve the heart not less than the understanding. It tends, in the first place, to moderate the selfish affections: by sweetening and harmonizing the temper, it is a strong antidote to the turbulence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> and violence of pursuit; it procures to a man so much mental enjoyment, that, in order to be occupied, he is not tempted in youth to precipitate into hunting, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAMING\">gaming</a>, drinking; nor in middle age, to deliver himself over to ambition; nor in old age, to avarice. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">Pride</a> and envy, two dishonourable passions, find in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> no enemy more formidable than a delicate and discerning taste: the man upon whom nature and culture have bestowed this blessing, feels great delight in the virtuous dispositions and actions of others; he loves to cherish them, and to publish them to the world: faults and failings, is it true, are to him not less obvious; but those he avoids, or removes out of sight, because they give him pain. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, a man void of taste, upon whom the most striking beauties make but a faint <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>, has no joy but in gratifying his pride or envy by the discovery of errors and blemishes. In a word, there may be other passions, which, for a season, disturb the peace of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> more than those mentioned: but no other passion is so unwearied an antagonist to the sweets of social intercourse: these passions, tending assiduously to their gratification, put a man perpetually in opposition to others; and dispose him more to relish bad than good qualities, even in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>. How different that disposition of mind, where every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> in a companion or neighbour, is, by refinement of taste, set in its strongest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>; and defects...\nIn the next place, delicacy of taste tends not less to invigorate the social affections than to moderate those that are selfish. To be convinced of this tendency, we need only reflect, that delicacy of taste necessarily heightens our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> of pain and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, and of course our sympathy, which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> branch of every social passion. Sympathy, in particular, invites a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of joys and sorrows, hopes and fears: such exercise, soothing, and satisfactory in itself, is necessarily productive of mutual good-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> and affection.\n\nOne other advantage of rational criticism is referred to the last place, being of all the most important; which is, that it is a great support to morality. No occupation attaches a man more to his duty than that of cultivating a taste in the fine arts: a just relish of what is beautiful, proper, elegant, and ornamental, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> or painting, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARDENING\">gardening</a>, is a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> for the same just relish of these qualities in character and behaviour. To the man who has acquired a taste so acute and accomplished, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> wrong or improper must be highly disagreeable: if, in any instance, the overbearing power of passion sway him from his duty, he returns to it upon the first reflection with redoubled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> never to be swayed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>: he has now an additional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> to virtue, a conviction derived from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> depends on regularity and order, and that a disregard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> or propriety never fails to be punished with shame and remorse.\n\nFor the rules of criticism applicable to the fine arts, and derived from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> nature, see Architecture, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">Beauty</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGRUITY\">Congruity</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">Comparison</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">Grandeur</a>, &c.","sp":387,"ep":388},{"h":"CRITO","t":"an Athenian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, flourished 400 years before Christ.

It was found in the side of a large mountain in the middle part of Germany, and in a stratum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> fossil stone, somewhat like our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> slate, but of a coarser texture, the same with that in which the fossil fishes in many parts of the world are found.

The part of the stone where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> lay was not found; this being broken off <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> at the shoulders, but that irregularly; so that in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, a part of the back of the head was visible in its natural form. The two shoulder-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> were very fair, and three of the feet were well preserved: the legs were of their natural shape and size, and the feet preserved even to the extremities of the five toes of each.\n\nCrocodile (crocodilus), in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">Rhetoric</a>, a captious and sophistical kind of argumentation, contrived to seduce the unwary, and draw them specially into a snare. It has its name crocodile from the following occasion, invented by the poets. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> woman, begging a crocodile that had caught her son walking by the riverside to spare and restore him, was answered, that he would restore him, provided she should give a true answer to a question he should propose: the question was, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">Will</a> I restore thy son <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> not?

He subdued the Phrygians, Mylians, Paphlagonians, Thracians, and Carian; amassed together immense riches; and became one of the most powerful and magnificent princes in the world. He drew the learned to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, and took a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> in conversing with them. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THALES\">Thales</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILETUS\">Miletus</a>, Pittacus of Mytilene, Bias of Priene, Cleobulus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINDUS\">Lindus</a>, and most of the other \"wise men,\" as they are emphatically styled, who lived in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, as well as \u00c6sop the fabulist, and the elegant Greek poets of the times, were bountifully received at the court of Croesus. There is still on record a memorable conversation between that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> and Solon, which seemed to predict the subsequent events of his reign, and which had a late but important influence on the character and fortune of the Lydian king. Croesus having entertained his Athenian guest, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> fashion, for several days, before he asked him any questions, ostentatiously showed him the magnificence of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, and particularly the riches of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>. After all had been displayed to the best advantage, the king complimented Solon upon his curiosity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of knowledge; and asked him as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> who had seen many countries, and reflected with much judgment upon what he had seen, Whom of all men he esteemed most happy? By the particular occasion, as well as the triumphant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> with which the question was proposed, the king made it evident that he expected flattery rather than information. But Solon's character had not been enervated by the debilitating air of a court; and he replied with a manly freedom, \"Tellus, the Athenian.\" Croesus, who had scarcely learned to distinguish, even in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, between wealth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>, inquired with a tone of surprize, why this preference to Tellus? \"Tellus,\" rejoined Solon, \"was not conspicuous for his riches or his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>, being only a simple citizen of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>; but he was defended from parents who deserved the first honours of the republic. He was equally fortunate in his children, who obtained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> esteem by their probity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a>, and every useful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the mind or body: and as to himself, he died fighting gallantly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, which his valour rendered victorious in a doubtful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a>; on which account the Athenians buried him on the spot where he fell, and distinguished him by every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> which public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> can confer on illustrious merit.\"\n\nCroesus had little encouragement, after this answer, to ask Solon, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, Whom, next to Tellus, he deemed most happy? Such, however, is the illusion of vanity, that he still ventured to make this demand; and still, as we are informed by the most circumstantial of historians, entertained hopes of being favourably answered. But Solon replied with the same freedom as before, \"The brothers Cleobis and Biton, two youths of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARGOS\">Argos</a>, whose strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> were crowned with repeated victory at the Olympic games; who deserved the affection of their parents, the gratitude of their country, the admiration of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>; and who, having ended their lives with peculiar felicity, were commemorated by the most signal monuments of immortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>.\" \"And is the happiness of a king, then,\" said Croesus, \"so little regarded, O Grecian stranger, that you prefer to it the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> condition of an Athenian or Argive citizen?\" The reply of Solon sufficiently justified his reputation for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>. \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of man,\" said he, \"consists of 70 years, which make 25,550 days; an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>; yet in the longest life, the events of any one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not be found exactly alike to those of another. The affairs of men are liable to perpetual vicissitudes: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">Divinity</a> who presides over our fate is envious of too much prosperity; and all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> life, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not condemned to calamity, is at least liable to accident. Whoever has uninterruptedly enjoyed a prosperous tide of success may justly be called fortunate; but he cannot before his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> be entitled to the epithet of happy.\"\n\nThe events which soon followed this conversation, prove how little satisfaction is derived from the possession of a throne. Victorious in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, unrivalled in wealth, supreme in power, Croesus felt and acknowledged his unhappiness. The warmest affections of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> centered in his son Atys, a youth of the most promising hopes, who had often fought and conquered by his side. The strength of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> was accompanied with an excess of paternal care, and the anxiety of his waking hours disturbed the tranquillity of his rest. He dreamed that his beloved son was slain by a dart; and the solicitude with which he watched his safety, preventing the youth from his usual occupations and amusements, and thereby rendering him too eager to enjoy them, most probably exposed him to the much-dreaded misfortune. Reluctantly permitted to engage in a party of hunting, the juvenile ardour of Atys, increased by the impatience of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> restraint, made him neglect the precautions necessary in that manly amusement. He was slain by a dart aimed at a wild boar of monstrous size, which had long spread terror over the country of the Mylians. The weapon came from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of Adraustus, a Phrygian prince and fugitive, whom Croesus had purified from the involuntary guilt of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>'s blood, and long distinguished by peculiar marks of bounty. To the grateful protection of the Phrygian, Croesus recommended, at parting, the safety of his beloved son. A mournful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESSION\">procession</a> of Lydians brought to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDIS\">Sardis</a> the dead body of Atys. The ill-fated murderer followed behind.\nWhen they approached the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> presence, Adraustes stepped forward and entreated Croesus to put him to death; thinking life <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> longer to be endured after killing, first his own brother, and then the son of his benefactor. But the Lydian king, notwithstanding the excess of his affliction, acknowledged the innocence of Adraustes, and the power of fate. \"Stranger, your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> is blameless, being committed without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>. I know that my son was destined to a premature death.\" Adraustes, though pardoned by Croesus, could not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> himself. When the mourners were removed, he privately returned, and perished by his own hand on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a> of Atys.\n\nTwo years Croesus remained disconsolate for the loss of his son; and might have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to indulge his unavailing affliction during the remainder of life, had not the growing greatness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, which threatened the safety of his dominions, roused him from his dream of misery. (See Lydia.)\u2014He marched against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYRUS\">Cyrus</a> with a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, but was defeated; and retreating to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> Sardis, was there besieged. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> was taken by assault; and as a Persian folder was going to kill Croesus, that prince's only surviving son, who had hitherto been dumb, terrified at his danger, cried, \"Stop, folder, and touch not Croesus.\" But though delivered by this extraordinary accident from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> rage of the folder, he seemed to be reserved for a harder fate. Dragged into the presence of his conqueror, he was loaded with irons; and the stern, unrelenting Cyrus, of whose humane temper of mind we have so beautiful, but so flattering, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> in the philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANCE\">romance</a> of Xenophon, ordered him, with the melancholy train of his Lydian attendants, to be committed to the flames. An immense pile of wood and other combustibles was erected in the most spacious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the city. The miserable victims, bound hand and foot, were placed on the top of the pyre. Cyrus, surrounded by his generals, witnessed the dreadful spectacle, either from an abominable principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> he had bound himself by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOW\">vow</a> to sacrifice Croesus as the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of his Lydian victory, or from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> of curiosity, equally cruel and impious, to try whether Croesus, who had so magnificently adorned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> and enriched the ministers of the gods, would be helped in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of need by the miraculous interposition of his much honoured protectors. Meanwhile the unfortunate Lydian, oppressed and confounded by the intolerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of his present calamity compared with the security and splendor of his former state, recollected his memorable conversation with the Athenian sage, and uttered with a deep groan the name of Solon. Cyrus asked by an interpreter, \"Whose name he invoked?\" \"His,\" replied Croesus, emboldened by the prospect of certain death, \"whole words ought ever to speak to the heart of kings.\" This reply not being satisfactory, he was commanded to explain at full length the subject of his thoughts. Accordingly he related the important discourse which had passed between himself and the Athenian, of which it was the great moral, That no man could be called happy till his death.\n\nThe words of a dying man are fitted to make a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on the heart. Those of Croesus deeply affected the mind of Cyrus. The Persian considered the speech of Solon as addressed to himself. He repented of his intended cruelty towards the unfortunate prince, who had formerly enjoyed all the pomp of prosperity; and dreading the concealed vengeance that might lurk in the bosom of fate, gave orders that the pyre should be extinguished. But the workmen who had been employed to prepare it, had performed their task with so much care, that the order could not speedily be obeyed. At that moment, Croesus calling on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a>, whose favourite shrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DELPHI\">Delphi</a> had experienced his generous munificence, and whose perfidious oracle had made him so ungrateful a return; the god, it is said, sent a plentiful shower to extinguish the pyre. This event, which saved the life, and which sufficiently attested the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, of Croesus, strongly recommended him to the credulity of his conqueror. It seemed impossible to pay too much respect to a man who was evidently the favourite of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>. Cyrus gave orders that he should be seated by his side, and thenceforth treated as a king; a revolution of fortune equally sudden and unexpected. But the mind of Croesus had undergone a still more important revolution: for, tutored in the useful school of adversity, he learned to think with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, to govern his own passions by the dictates of reason, and to repay by wholesome advice the generous behaviour of his Persian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>.\n\nThe first advantage which he derived from the change in Cyrus's disposition towards him, was the permission of sending his fetters to the temple of the Delphian Apollo, whose flattering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORACLES\">oracles</a> had encouraged him to wage war with the Persians. \"Behold,\" were his messengers instructed to say, \"the trophies of our promised succours! behold the monuments of the unerring veracity of the god!\" The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHIA\">Pythia</a> heard their reproach with a smile of contemptuous indignation, and answered it with that solemn gravity which she was so carefully taught to assume: \"The gods themselves cannot avoid their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTINY\">destiny</a>, much less avert, however they may retard, the determined fates of men. Croesus has suffered, and justly suffered, for the crime of his ancestor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GYGES\">Gyges</a>; who, entrusted as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of the guards, with the person of Candaules, the last king of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>, was seduced by an impious woman to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> his master, to defile his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, and to usurp his royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>. For this complicated guilt of Gyges the misfortunes of Croesus have atoned; but know, that through the favour of Apollo, these misfortunes have happened three years later than the fates ordained.\" The Pythia then proceeded to explain her answers concerning the event of the war against Cyrus, and proved, to the conviction of the Lydians, that her words, if properly understood, portended the destruction, not of the Persian, but of the Lydian empire. Croesus heard with resignation the report of his messengers, and acknowledged the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> of the Delphian oracle, which maintained and increased the lustre of its ancient fame. This fallen monarch survived Cyrus. The manner of his death is not known.","sp":389,"ep":390},{"h":"CROFT","t":"a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> adjoining to a dwelling-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, and inclosed for pasture <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> arable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, or any other purpose.\u2014In some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> deeds, crofta occurs as the Latin word for a \"croft;\" but cum tofis et creftis is more frequent.

The foundation of them was a superstitious veneration for those places where our Saviour performed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a>, and accomplished the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDEMPTION\">redemption</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a> had been taken, and Palestine conquered, by Omar the successor of Abu Becr*, who succeeded Mahomet himself. This proved a considerable interruption to the pilgrims, who flocked from all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> to perform their devotions at the holy sepulchre. They had, however, still been allowed this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, on paying a small tribute to the Saracen caliphs, who were not much inclined to molest them. But, in 1065, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> changed its matters. The Turks took it from the Saracens; and being much more fierce and barbarous than the former, the pilgrims now found they could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> longer perform their devotions with the same safety they did before. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> was about this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> also prevalent in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, which made these pilgrimages much more frequent than formerly. It was somehow or other imagined, that the thousand years mentioned in the 20th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of the Revelations, were fulfilled; that Christ was soon to make his appearance in Palestine, to judge the world; and consequently that journeys to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> were in the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> meritorious, and even absolutely necessary. The multitudes of pilgrims which now flocked to Palestine, meeting with a very rough reception from the Turks, filled all Europe with complaints against those infidels who profaned the holy city by their presence, and derided the sacred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of Christianity even in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where they were fulfilled. Pope Gregory VII. had formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of uniting all the princes of Christendom against the Mahometans; but his exorbitant encroachments upon the civil power of princes had created him so many enemies, and rendered his schemes so suspicious, that he was not able to make great progress in the undertaking. The work was referred for a meaner <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called the bermi, a native of Amiens in Picardy, had made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem; and being deeply affected with the dangers to which that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> now exposed the pilgrims, as well as with the opprobrium under which the eastern Christians now laboured, formed the bold, and, in all appearance, impracticable design of leading into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, from the farthest extremities of the west, armies sufficient to subdue those potent and warlike nations that now held the Holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">Land</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>. He propounded his scheme to Martin II. who then filled the papal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a>; but he, though sensible enough of the advantages which must accrue to himself from such an undertaking, resolved not to interpose his authority till he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> of success. He summoned, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACENTIA\">Placentia</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> consisting of 4000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a> and 30,000 seculars. As no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> could be found <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> enough to contain such a multitude, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> was held in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>. Here the Pope himself, as well as Peter, harangued the people, representing the dismal situation of their brethren in the east, and the indignity offered to the Christian name in allowing the holy city to remain in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the infidels. These speeches were so agreeable to those who heard them, that the whole multitude suddenly and violently declared for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, and solemnly devoted themselves to perform this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, which they believed to be so meritorious in the sight of God.\n\nBut though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> seemed to have embraced the design with ardour, Martin yet thought it necessary, in order to insure perfect success, to engage the greater and more warlike nations in the same enterprise. Having therefore exhorted Peter to visit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> cities and sovereigns of Christendom, he summoned another council at Clermont in Auvergne. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of this great and pious design being now universally diffused, procured the attendance of the greatest prelates, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a>, and princes; and when the Pope and the hermit renewed their pathetic exhortations, the whole assembly, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> impelled by an immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a>, exclaimed with one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, \"It is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> of God! it is the will of God!\" These words were deemed so memorable, and so much the effect of a divine impulse, that they were employed as the signal of rendezvous and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> in all future exploits of these adventurers. Men of all ranks now flew to arms with the utmost ardour, and a crois was affixed to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> shoulder by all who enlisted in this holy enterprise.\n\nAt this time Europe was sunk in the most profound <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>. The ecclesiastics had gained the greatest ascendancy over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> mind; and the people, who committed the most horrid crimes and disorders, knew of no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPIATION\">expiation</a> than the observances imposed on them by their spiritual pastors.\n\nBut amidst the abject superstition which now prevailed, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> spirit had also universally diffused itself; and, though not supported by art or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>, was become the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> of the nations governed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol9.html#article-FEUDAL_LAW\">feudal <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>. All the great lords policed the right of peace and war. They were engaged in continual hostilities with one another: the open country was become a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of outrage and disorder: the cities, still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, were neither guarded by walls nor protected by privileges. Every man was obliged to depend for safety on his own force, or his private alliances; and valour was the only excellence which was held in esteem, or gave one man the pre-eminence above another. When all the particular superstitions, therefore, were here united in one great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, the ardour for private hostilities took the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>; \"and all Europe (as the princess <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNA\">Anna</a> Comnena expresses herself), torn from its foundations, seemed ready to precipitate itself in one united body upon Asia.\"\n\nAll orders of men, now deeming the croisades the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, were impatient to open the way with their swords to the holy city. Nobles, artisans, peasants, even priests, enrolled their names; and to decline this service was branded with the reproach of impiety or cowardice. The nobles who enlisted themselves were moved, by the romantic spirit of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, to hope for opulent establishments in the east, the chief seat of arts and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> at that time. In pursuit of these chimerical projects, they sold at the lowest price their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> castles and inheritances, which had now lost all value in their eyes. The infirm and aged contributed to the expedition by presents and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>; and many of them, not satisfied with this, attended\ntended it in person, being determined, if possible, to breathe their last in sight of that city where their Saviour had died for them. Women themselves, concealing their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a> under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> of armour, attended the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>; and commonly forgot their duty still more, by prostituting themselves to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>. The greatest criminals were forward in a service which they considered as an expiation for all crimes; and the most enormous disorders were, during the course of these expeditions, committed by men inured to wickedness, encouraged by example, and impelled by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>. The multitude of adventurers soon became so great, that their more sagacious leaders became apprehensive lest the greatness of the armament would be the cause of its own disappointment. For this reason they permitted an undisciplined multitude, computed at 300,000 men, to go before them under the command of Peter the hermit, and Gautier or Walter, surnamed the moneyer, from his being a folder of fortune. They took the road towards Constantinople through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUNGARY\">Hungary</a> and Bulgaria; and, trusting that heaven, by supernatural assistance, would supply all their necessities, they made no provision for subsistence in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a>. They soon found themselves obliged to obtain by plunder what they vainly expected from miracles; and the enraged inhabitants of the countries through which they passed, attacked the disorderly multitude, and slaughtered them without resistance. The more disciplined armies followed after; and, passing the straits of Constantinople, they were mustered in the plains of Asia, and amounted in the whole to 700,000 men.\n\nThe rage for conquering the Holy Land did not cease with this expedition. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for very near two centuries, and eight different croisades were set on foot, one after another. The first was in the year 1096, as already observed. The princes engaged in it were, Hugo, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> of Vermandois, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> I., <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of France; Robert, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Normandy; Robert, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a>; Raymond, earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOULOUSE\">Toulouse</a> and St Giles; Godfrey of Bouillon, duke of Lorraine, with his brothers Baldwin and Eustace; Stephen, earl of Chartres and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOIS\">Blois</a>; Hugo, count of St Paul; with a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of other lords. The general rendezvous was at Constantinople. In this expedition, the famous Godfrey besieged and took the city of Nice. The city of Jerusalem was taken by the confederated army, and Godfrey chosen king. The Christians gained the famous battle of Alcalon against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SULTAN\">sultan</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>; which put an end to the first croisade.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> croisade, in the year 1144, was headed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONRAD\">Conrad</a> III. and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> VII., king of France. The emperor's army was either destroyed by the enemy, or perished through the treachery of Manuel the Greek emperor; and the second army, through the unfaithfulness of the Christians of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, was forced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> up the siege of Damascus.\n\nThe third croisade, in the year 1188, immediately followed the taking of Jerusalem by Saladin the sultan of Egypt. The princes engaged in this expedition were, the emperor Frederic Barbarossa; Frederic duke of Swabia, his second son; Leopold duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a>; Berthold duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORAVIA\">Moravia</a>; Herman marquis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BADEN\">Baden</a>; the counts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NASSAU\">Nassau</a>, Thuringia, Mifler, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>; and above 60 other princes of the empire; with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUFORT\">Beaufort</a>, Cambrai, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUNSTER\">Munster</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OSNABRUCK\">Osnabruck</a>, Miflen, Paffau, Viburg, and several others. In this expedition, the emperor Frederic defeated the sultan of Iconium; his son Frederic, joined by Guy Lusignan king of Jerusalem, in vain endeavoured to take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">Acre</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMAIS\">Ptolemais</a>. During which transactions, Philip Augustus king of France, and Richard I., king of England, joined the croisade; by which means the Christian army consisted of 300,000 fighting men; but great disputes happening between the kings of France and England, the former quitted the Holy Land, and Richard concluded a peace with Saladin.\n\nThe fourth croisade was undertaken, in the year 1195, by the emperor Henry VI., after Saladin's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. In this expedition the Christians gained several battles against the infidels, took a great many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, and were in the way of succours, when the death of the emperor obliged them to quit the Holy Land, and return into Germany.\n\nThe fifth croisade was published, by order of Pope Innocent III., in 1198. Those engaged in it made fruitless efforts for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> of the Holy Land; for, though John de Neuville, who commanded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> equipped in Flanders, arrived at Ptolemais a little after Simon of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MONTFORT\">Montfort</a>, Reynard of Dampierre, and others; yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> destroying many of them, and the rest either returning, or engaging in the petty quarrels of the Christian princes, there was nothing done; so that the sultan of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEPPO\">Aleppo</a> easily defeated their troops in 1204.\n\nThe sixth croisade began in 1228; in which the Christians took the town of Damietta, but were forced to surrender it again. The next year the emperor Frederic made peace with the sultan for 10 years. About 1242, Richard earl of Cornwall, and brother to Henry III., king of England, arrived in Palestine at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the English croisade; but finding it most advantageous to conclude a peace, he reembarked, and steered towards Italy. In 1244, the Karasimans being driven out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a>, broke into Palestine, and gave the Christians a general defeat near Gaza.\n\nThe seventh croisade was headed by St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEWIS\">Lewis</a>, in the year 1249, who took the town of Damietta; but a sickness happening in the Christian army, the king endeavoured a retreat; in which being pursued by the infidels, most of his army were miserably butchered, and himself and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> taken prisoners. Then a truce was agreed upon for 10 years, and the king and lords set at liberty.\n\nThe eighth croisade, in 1270, was headed by the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, who made himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the port and castle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>; but dying in a short time, he left his army in a very ill condition. Soon after, the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a> coming up with a good fleet, and raising Philip the Bold, son and successor of Lewis the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUNIS\">Tunis</a>, after several engagements with the Christians, in which he was always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-WORSTED\">worsted</a>, desired peace, which was granted upon conditions advantageous to the Christians; after which both princes embarked for their own kingdoms. Prince Edward of England, who arrived at Tunis at the time of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a>, sailed towards Ptolemais, where he landed with a small body of\nCroifade of 300 English and French, and hindered Bendocdar from laying siege to Ptolemais; but being obliged to quit the Holy Land to take possession of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of England, this croifade ended without contributing anything to the recovery of the Holy Land. In 1291, the town of Acre, or Ptolemais, was taken and plundered by the soldan of Egypt, and the Christians quite driven out of Syria. There has been no croifade since that time, though several popes have attempted to stir up the Christians to such an undertaking; particularly Nicholas IV. in 1292, and Clement V. in 1311.\n\nThough these croifades were effects of the most absurd superstition, they tended greatly to promote the good of Europe. Multitudes indeed were destroyed. M. Voltaire computes the people who perished in the different expeditions at upwards of two millions. Many there were, however, who returned; and these having conversed so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> with people who lived in a much more magnificent way than themselves, began to entertain some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for a refined and polished way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. Thus the barbarism in which Europe had been so long immersed, began to wear off soon after this time. The princes also who remained at home, found means to avail themselves of the frenzy of the people. By the absence of such numbers of restless and martial adventurers peace was established in their dominions. They also took the opportunity of annexing to their crown many considerable fiefs, either by purchase, or by the extinction of the heirs; and thus the mischiefs which must always attend feudal governments were considerably lessened.\n\nWith regard to the bad success of the croifaders, it was scarce possible that any other thing could happen them. The emperors of Constantinople, instead of afflicting, did all in their power to disconcert their schemes. They were jealous, and not without reason, of such an inundation of barbarians. Yet, had they considered their true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, they would rather have assisted them, or at least stood <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEUTER\">neuter</a>, than entered into alliances with the Turks. They followed the latter method, however, and were often of very great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> to the western adventurers, which at last occasioned the loss of their city*. But the worst enemies the croifaders had, were their own internal feuds and dissensions. They neither could agree while marching together in armies with a view to conquest, nor could they unite their conquests under one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> after they had made them. They set up three small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, one at Jerusalem, another at Antioch, and another at Edessa. These states, instead of afflicting, made war upon each other, and on the Greek emperors; and thus became an easy prey to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> enemy. The horrid cruelties they committed also were such as must have inspired the Turks with the most invincible hatred against them, and made them retort with the greatest obstinacy. They were such as could have been committed only by barbarians inflamed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> enthusiasm. When Jerusalem was taken, not only the numerous garrison were put to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, but the inhabitants were massacred without mercy and without distinction. No age or sex was spared, even children at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> were barbarously murdered. According to Voltaire, some Christians, who had been suffered by the Turks to live in that city, led the conquerors into the most private caves where women had concealed themselves with their children, and not one of them was suffered to escape. What eminently shows the enthusiasm with which these conquerors were animated, is their behaviour after this terrible slaughter. They marched over heaps of dead bodies towards the holy sepulchre; and while their hands were yet polluted with the blood of so many innocent persons, sang anthems to the common Saviour of mankind. Nay, so far did their religious enthusiasm overcome their fury, that these ferocious conquerors now burst into tears. If the absurdity and wickedness of this conduct can be exceeded by anything, it must be by what follows. In the year 1294, the frenzy of croifading seized the children, who are ever ready to imitate what they see their parents engage themselves in. Their childish folly was encouraged by the monks and schoolmasters; and thousands of these innocents were conducted from the houses of their parents on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> of these words, \"Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou perfected praise.\" Their base conductors sold a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of them to the Turks, and the rest perished miserably.","sp":390,"ep":393},{"h":"CROISERS","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> order founded in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> discovery of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> by the empress Helena.

The cross to which our Saviour was fastened, and on which he died, was of the former kind; being thus represented by old monuments, coins, and crosses; and St Jerome compares it to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a>, or praying with his arms extended. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> of the cross was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> among the Syrians, Egyptians, Persians, Africans, Greeks, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, and Jews.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of the cross was the most dreadful of all others, both for the shame and pain of it; and so scandalous, that it was inflicted as the last mark of detestation upon the vilest of people. It was the punishment of robbers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MURDERERS\">murderers</a>, provided that they were slaves too; but otherwise, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they were free, and had the privileges of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Rome, this was then thought a profanation of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>, and too infamous a punishment for such a one, let his crimes be what they would.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSAIC_LAW\">Mosaic <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> ordained, that the persons executed should not be left upon the tree after sunset, because he that is hanged in this manner is accursed of God, Deut. xxi. 22. The Jews believe, that the souls of those who remain upon the gibbet, and without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURIAL\">burial</a>, enjoy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> peace, and receive no benefit from the prayers of other people; but wander up and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> till their bodies are buried: which agrees with the notions that the Greeks and Romans had of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, as may be seen in Hom. Iliad 4. and Virg. Aeneid. 6.\nThe form of a crofs being such as has been already described, the body of the criminal was fastened to the upright piece by nailing the feet to it, and on the other transverse piece generally by nailing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> on each side. Now, because these parts of the body, being the instruments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, are provided by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> with a much greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a> than others have occasion for; and because all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> is performed by the spirit contained in these nerves; it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> follow, as Stanhope observes, that wherever they abound, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of pain must needs in proportion be more quick and tender.\n\nThe Jews confess, that indeed they crucified people in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, but deny that they inflicted this punishment upon any one alive. They first put them to death, and then fastened them to the cross either by the hands or neck. But there are indisputable proofs of their crucifying men frequently alive. The worshippers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAAL\">Baal</a>-panor and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Ai were hung up alive; as were also the defendants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAUL\">Saul</a>, who were put into the hands of the Gibonites, 2 Sam. xxii. 9.\n\nBefore crucifixion the criminal was generally scourged with cords: sometimes little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>, or pieces of bones, were tied to these scourges, so that the condemned person might suffer more severely. It was also a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, that he who was to be crucified should bear his own cross to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of execution. After this manner we find Christ was compelled to bear his own cross; and as he sunk under the burden, Simon the Cyrenian was constrained to bear it after him and with him. But whereas it is generally supposed that our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> bore the whole cross, i.e., the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and transverse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> both, this seems to be a thing impossible; and therefore Lipsius (in his treatise De Supplicio Crucis) has set the matter in a true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, when he tells us that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> only carried the transverse beam; because the long beam, or the body of the cross, was either fixed in the ground before, or made ready to be set up as soon as the prisoner came; and from hence he observes, that painters are very much mistaken in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of our Saviour carrying the whole cross.\n\nThere were several ways of crucifying; sometimes the criminal was fastened with cords to a tree, sometimes he was crucified with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> downwards. This way St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> chose out of respect to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> Jesus Christ, not thinking himself worthy to be crucified like him; though the common way of crucifying was by fastening the criminal with nails, one through each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and one through both feet, or one through each of them: for this was not always performed in the same manner; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> sometimes representing Jesus Christ crucified with four nails, and sometimes with three. The criminal was fixed to the cross quite naked; and in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> the Saviour of the world was not used with any greater tenderness than others upon whom the punishment was inflicted. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> divided his clothes among them, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> lots for his tunic, which is an under garment worn over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> like a shirt.\n\nThe text of the gospel shows clearly, that Jesus Christ was fastened to the cross with nails; and the Psalmist (xxii. 16.) had foretold long before, that they should pierce his hands and his feet; but there are great disputes concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of these nails. The Greeks represent our Saviour as fastened to the cross with four nails; in which particular Gregory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TOURS\">Tours</a> agrees with them, one at each hand and foot. But several are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that our Saviour's hands and feet were pierced with three nails only, viz. one at each hand, and one through both his feet: and the custom of the Latins is rather for this last opinion; for the generality of the old crucifixes made in the Latin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> have only three nails. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NONNUS\">Nonnus</a> thinks that our Saviour's arms were besides bound fast to the cross with chains; and St Hilary speaks of the cords where-with he was tied to it.\n\nSometimes they who were fastened upon the cross lived a good while in that condition. St Andrew is believed to have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> three days alive upon it. Eusebius speaks of certain martyrs in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> who were kept upon the cross till they were starved to death. Pilate was amazed at Jesus Christ dying so soon; because naturally he must have lived longer, if it had not been in his power to have laid down his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> and to take it up again. The thighs of the two thieves who were crucified together with our Saviour were broken, in order to hasten their death, that their bodies might not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> (John xix. 31, 32, 33.), and to comply with the law of Moses, which forbids the bodies to be left there after sunset. But among other nations they were suffered to remain upon the cross a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. Sometimes they were devoured alive by birds and beasts of prey. Guards were appointed to observe that none of their friends or relations should take them down and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> them. The story of the Egyptian matron and the folder who was set to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> the cross, is very well known. The Roman soldiers who had crucified Jesus Christ and the two thieves continued near the cross till the bodies were taken down and buried.\n\nCrosses were usually, in former times, erected on the tops of houses, by which tenants pretended to claim the privileges of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEMPLARS\">Templars</a> Hospitallers, to defend themselves against their rightful lords. This was condemned by the statute Wil. II. c. 37: It was usual also, in those days, to set up crosses in places where the corpse of any of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> rested as it was carried to be buried, that a transiuntibus pro ejus animo diperceatur. Crosses, &c., are forbidden to be brought into England by 13 Eliz. c. 2, on pain of a premunire, &c.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">Invention</a> of the Cross, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> feast solemnized on the third of May, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of St Helena's (the mother of Constantine) finding the true cross of Christ deep in the ground on Mount Calvary; where she erected a church for the preservation of part of it; the rest being brought to Rome and deposited in the church of the Holy Cross of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>.\n\nTheodoret mentions the finding of three crosses; that of Jesus Christ and those of the two thieves; and that they distinguished between them by means of a sick woman, who was immediately healed by touching the true cross. The place is said to have been pointed out to her by St Quiriacus, then a Jew, afterwards converted and canonized.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXALTATION\">Exaltation</a> of the Cross, an ancient feast, held on the 14th of September, in memory of this, that Heraclius restored to Mount Calvary the true cross in 642, which had been carried off 14 years before by Colossus king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, upon his taking Jerusalem from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Phocas.\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a> of the cross appears to have been practised in the ancient church; inasmuch as the heathens, particularly Julian, reproach the primitive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> with it. And we do not find that their apologists disclaimed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>. Momay, indeed, asserted, that this had been done by St Cyril, but could not support his allegation at the conference of Fontainebleau. St Helena is said to have reduced the adoration of the cross to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> principle, since she adored in the wood, not the wood itself, which had been directed idolatry and heathenism, but him who had been nailed to this wood. With such modifications some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a> have been induced to admit the adoration of the cross. John Hus allowed of the phrase, provided it were expressly added, that the adoration was relative to the person of Christ. But however <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMAN_CATHOLICS\">Roman Catholics</a> may seem to triumph by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of such distinction and mitigations, it is well known they have no great place in their own practice. Imbert, the good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> of Gafcony, was severely prosecuted in 1683 for telling the people, that in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> of adoring the cross, practised in that church on Good Friday, they were not to adore the wood, but Christ, who was crucified on it. The curate of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> told them the contrary: it was the wood! the wood! they were to adore. Imbert replied, it was Christ, not the wood: for which he was cited before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOURDEAUX\">Bourdeaux</a>, suspended from his functions, and threatened with chains and perpetual imprisonment. It little availed him to cite the bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAUX\">Meaux</a>'s distinction; it was answered that the church allowed it not.\n\nCross-Bearer (port-croix, cruciger), in the Roman church, the chaplain of an archbishop or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMATE\">primate</a>, who bears a cross before him on solemn occasions.\n\nThe pope has the cross borne before him everywhere; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a> anywhere out of Rome; and primates, metropolitans, and those who have a right to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALLIUM\">pallium</a>, throughout their respective jurisdictions.\n\nGregory XI. forbade all patriarchs and prelates to have it borne in presence of cardinals. A prelate bears a single cross, a patriarch a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> cross, and the pope a triple one on his arms.\n\nCross-Bearers also denote certain officers in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INQUISITION\">inquisition</a>, who make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOW\">vow</a> before the inquisitors or their vicars to defend the Catholic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, though with the loss of fortune and life. Their business is to provide the inquisitors with necessaries. They were formerly of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>; but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time some of their constitutions were changed, and they were called of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENANCE\">penance</a> of St Dominic.\n\nPectoral Cross, is a cross of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> or silver, or other precious materials, often enriched with diamonds, which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, archbishops, &c., and regular abbeys, wear hanging from the neck.\n\nOrder of the Cross, or Croisade, an order of ladies instituted in 1668 by the empress Eleonora de Gonzaga, wife of the emperor Leopold; on occasion of the miraculous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> of a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> cross wherein were inclosed two pieces of the true cross, out of the ashes of part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>. It seems the fire had burnt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> wherein it was inclosed, and melted the crystal, yet the wood remained untouched.\n\nMaids of the Cross, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> of young women instituted in 1265 at Roye in Picardy, and since dispersed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>. They instruct young persons of their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>. Some take the three vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience; others retain their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>. They are under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of a superior.\n\nCross, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HERALDRY\">Heraldry</a>, is defined by Guillelmus, an ordinary composed of fourfold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>; whereof two are perpendicular, and the other two transverse; so we must conceive of them, though they be not drawn throughout, but meet by couples, in four right angles, near the fesse point of the escutcheon. See Heraldry.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> was first bestowed on such as had performed, or at least undertaken, some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> for Christ, and the Christian profession; and is held by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> charge in all heraldry. What brought it into such frequent use, was the ancient expeditions into the Holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">Land</a>; and the holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> pilgrims, after their pilgrimage, taking the cross for their cognizance; and the ensign of that war being the cross. In those wars, says Mackenzie, the Scots carried St Andrew's cross; the French a cross argent; the English a cross or; the Germans, fesse; the Italians, azure; the Spaniards, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULES\">gules</a>.\n\nSt George's Cross, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> cross, in a field argent, is now the standard of England; that saint being the reputed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of this nation.\n\nNor is it only in crosses that the variety is so great; the like is found in many other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARINGS\">bearings</a>, and particularly in lions, and the parts of them; whereof Columbiere gives us no less than 96 varieties. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEIGH\">Leigh</a> mentions but 46 several crosses; Sylvanus Morgan, 26; Upton, 30; Johannes de Bado Aureo, 12; and to others, whom it is needless to mention. Upton owns he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DARES\">dares</a> not presume to ascertain all the various crosses used in arms, for that they are at present almost innumerable; and therefore he only takes notice of such as he had seen used in his own time.\n\nCross, in mining, two nicks cut on the superficies of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, thus +, which the miners make when they take the ground to dig for ore. This cross gives the miners three days liberty to make and set on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>. As many of these crosses as the miner makes to many acres of ground he may have in the vein, provided he set on stones within three days after making his cross or crosses. But if he make but one cross, and a stranger by makes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, and a stranger makes the third, every one is served with the next near, according as they have first or last, sooner or later, made their crosses upon the ground.\n\nCross, in coins, a name given to the right side or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, the other being called the pile or reverse. It has been a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, that the reverse was meant by the cross; because at this time, with us, it is marked with figures disposed in that form: but the stamping the head of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> in these kingdoms on the right side of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>, was preceded by a general custom of striking on that part the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of a cross; while the other, called the pile, contained the arms, or some other device.\n\nCross, instead of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIGNATURE\">signature</a> to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a>, &c., is derived from the Saxon practice of affixing the sign of the cross, whether they could write or not.\n\nCross, in surveying, is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> which consists of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> circle, divided into four equal parts by two lines crossing each other in the centre. At each extremity of the lines is fixed a perpendicular sight, with\nCrofs. Small holes below each slit, for the better discovering of distant objects. The crofs is mounted on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a> or stand, to fix it in the ground, and it is found to be a very useful instrument for measuring small pieces of land, and taking offsets, &c.\n\nCross-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">Bar</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">Shot</a>, a bullet with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> bar passing through it, and standing six or eight inches out at both sides. It is used at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> for destroying the enemy's rigging.\n\nCross-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">Bill</a>.

See Bows and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHERY\">Archery</a>.\n\nCross-grained Stuff, in joinery. Wood is said to be cross-grained, when a bough or branch has shot out of it; for the grain of the branch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> forward, runs athwart that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a>.\n\nIn wood well grown this defect is scarce perceptible, except in working; but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a>-boards these boughs make knots. If the bough grew up with the young trunk, instead of a knot is found a curling in the stuff, very sensible under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>.\n\nCross-Jack, pronounced cro-jack, a sail extended on the lower yard of the mizen-mast, which is hence called the cross-jack yard. This sail, however, has generally been found of little service, and is therefore very seldom used.\n\nCross-Piece, a rail of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> extended over the windlass of a merchant ship from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a>-heads to the beltry. It is stuck full of wooden pins, which are used to fasten the running rigging as occasion requires. See Windlass.\n\nCross-Staff, or Fore-staff, is a mathematical instrument of hard wood, consisting of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> staff of about three feet long, having each of its faces divided like a line of tangents, and having four cross pieces of unequal lengths to fit on the staff, the halves of these being as the radii to the tangent lines on the faces of the staff.\u2014The instrument was formerly used in taking the altitudes of the celestial bodies at sea.\n\nCross-Timing, in Husbandry, a method of harrowing land, consisting in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARROW\">harrow</a> up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> it went down before, and down that which it was drawn up.\n\nCross-Trees, certain pieces of timber, supported by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a> and trestle-trees, at the upper ends of the lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASTS\">masts</a>, athwart which they are laid to sustain the frame of the top.\n\nCross-Tree Yard, is a yard standing square, just under the mizen-top, and to it the mizen-top is fastened below.

The citadel on one side hung over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, on the other towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>. It was naturally strong from its situation, but afterwards walled round; on which side it was taken by Dionysius by stratagem, by means of the rocks behind it.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a>, after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> peregrinations in search of knowledge, fixed his residence in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, which some authors think his native one, at least that of his parents, supposing him to have been born in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMOS\">Samos</a>, and not at some town of that name in Italy. This incomparable sage spent the latter part of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> in training up disciples to the rigid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of sublime and moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, and instructing the Crotonites in the true arts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, such as alone can insure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, and independence.\n\nUnder the influence of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, the Crotonites inured their bodies to frugality and hardships, and their minds to self-denial and patriotic disinterestedness. Their virtues were the admiration of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, where it was a current proverb, that the last of the Crotonites was the first of the Greeks. In one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLYMPIAD\">Olympiad</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> of the victors in the games were citizens of Croton; and the name of Milo is almost as famous as that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>. The vigour of the men and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of the women were ascribed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, which was believed to be endowed with qualities peculiarly favourable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> system. Their physicians were in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> repute; and among those, Alcmeon and Democides rendered themselves most conspicuous. Alcmeon was the first who dared to amputate a limb, in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the life of a patient; and also the first writer who thought of inculcating moral precepts under the amusing cloak of apologues. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> is more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> attributed to \u00c6sop, as he was remarkably ingenious in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>. Democides was famous for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>. Though careful and enriched by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> he had snatched from the jaws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, he abandoned wealth and honours, and by stratagem escaped to the humble comforts of a private life at Croton.\u2014The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGOREANS\">Pythagoreans</a> are said to have discovered that disposition of the solar system, which, with some modifications, has been revived by Copernicus, and is now universally received, as being most agreeable to nature and experiment. Theano, the wife of Pythagoras, and many other women, emulated the virtues of their husbands.\n\nIn those fortunate days the state of Croton was most flourishing. Its walls inclosed a circumference of 12 miles. Of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> sent out from Greece, this alone furnished succour to the mother-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> when invaded by the Perians. By its avenging arms the Sybarites were punished for their shameful degeneracy; but victory proved fatal to the conquerors, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, and all their pernicious attendants, infatuated themselves into Croton, and soon contaminated the purity of its principles. Indeed, the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of human nature militates against any long continuance in such rigid practices of virtue; and therefore it is no wonder if the Crotonites fell by degrees into the irregularities they once abhorred. Not long after the Locrians, who were less corrupted, defeated them on the banks of the Sagra, and reduced the republic to distress and penury. This restored the remaining Crotonites to their pristine vigour of mind, and enabled them to make a brave, though unsuccessful resistance, when attacked by Dionysius of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a>. They suffered much in the war with Pyrrhus, and, by repeated misfortunes, decreased in strength and numbers, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> to age, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANNIBAL\">Hannibal</a>, when they could not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MUSTER\">muster</a> 20,000 inhabitants. This small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> being incapable of manning the extensive works erected in the days of prosperity, Croton was taken by the Carthaginians, and its citizens transported to Locri. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> sent a colony hither 200 years before Christ.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> wore a crown, which was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILLET\">fillet</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> placed upon the forehead, and tied with a ribbon of hyacinth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> azure blue. It seems also as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> private priests, and even common Israelites, wore also a sort of crown, since God commands <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EZEKIEL\">Ezekiel</a> not to take off his crown, nor affume the marks of one in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">mourning</a>. This crown was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more than a ribbon or fillet, with which the Jews and several people in the east girt their heads. And indeed the first crowns were no more than a bandelet drawn round the head, and tied behind, as we still see it represented on medals round the heads of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>, the Ptolemies, and kings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>. Afterwards they consisted of two bandelets; by degrees they took branches of trees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> kinds; at length they added <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, insomuch that Claudius Saturninus says, there was not any plant whereof crowns had not been made. The woods and groves were searched to find different crowns for the several deities; and they were used not only on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> and images of the gods, by the priests in sacrificing, and by kings and emperors, but also on altars, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>, doors of housetops, sacred victims, ships, &c.\n\nThe Roman emperors had four kinds of crowns; still seen on medals, viz. a crown of laurels, a radial or radiating crown, a crown adorned with pearls and precious\nCrown, ous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, and the fourth a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONNET\">bonnet</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>, something like the mortier.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> had also various kinds of crowns, which they distributed as rewards of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> achievements; as, 1. The oval crown, made of myrtle, and bestowed upon generals, who were entitled to the honours of the lesser triumph, called ovation. 2. The naval or rostral crown, composed of a circle of gold, with ornaments representing beaks of ships, and given to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a> who first grappled, or the soldier who first boarded, an enemy's ship. 3. The crown called in Latin vallaris, caerulescens, a circle of gold raised with jewels or palisades; the reward of him who first forced the enemy's entrenchments. 4. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURAL\">mural</a> crown, a circle of gold indented and embattled; given to him who first mounted the wall of a besieged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and there lodged a standard. 5. The civic crown, made of the branch of a green oak, and given him who had saved the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of a citizen. 6. The triumphal crown, consisting at first of wreaths of laurel, but afterwards made of gold; proper to such generals as had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of a triumph. 7. The crown called obfessionalis, or grammata, made of garlands growing on the place; the reward of a general who had delivered a Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> from a siege. 8. The radial crown, given to princes at their translation among the gods. We meet also with the corona aurea, often bestowed on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> without any other additional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a>; athletic crowns, and crowns of laurel, destined to crown victors at the public games, poets, orators, &c. All these crowns were marks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> to the wearers; and upon competitions with rivals for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and dignities, often determined the preference in their favour.

But, in its extensive sense, it takes in several others; as the French ecu, which we call the French crown, struck in 1641 for sixty sols, or three livres; also the pata- gon, dollar, ducatoon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIXDOLLAR\">rixdollar</a>, and piastre or piece of eight.\n\nCrown, in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> sense, is used for the clerical tonsure; which is the mark or character of the Romish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a>.

The clerical crown was anciently a round lift of hair, shaved off around the head, representing a real crown: this is easily observable in several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> statues, &c.

It is of the fidicinal kind, somewhat resembling a violin, 12 inches in length, and an inch and a half in thickness. It has six strings supported by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>, and is played on with a bow: the bridge differs from that of a violin, in that it is flat and not convex on the top; a circumstance from which it is to be inferred, that the strings are to be struck at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, so as to afford a succession of concords. The bridge is not placed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> with the sides of the instrument, but in an oblique <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>; and, which is further to be remarked, one of the feet of the bridge goes through one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>-holes, which are circular, and rests on the inside of the back; the other foot, which is proportionally shorter, resting on the belly before the other sound-hole. Of the strings the four first are conducted from the bridge <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the finger board, as in a common violin; but the fifth and sixth, which are about an inch longer than the others, leave the small end of the neck about an inch to the right. The whole six are wound up either by wooden pegs in the form of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> T, or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> pins, which are turned with a wrest like those of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARP\">harp</a> or spinet. Of the tuning, it is to be remarked, that the fifth and sixth strings are the unison and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OCTAVE\">octave</a> of G; the fourth and fifth, the same of C; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> and first, the same of D; so that the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of strings are a fourth, and the third a fifth, to the first. See Plate CLXIV.\n\nConcerning the antiquity of this instrument, there is but little written <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> to carry it further back than the time of Leland; nevertheless the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> antiquity is so strong among the inhabitants of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> where it was used, as to afford a probable ground of conjecture, that the cruth might be the prototype of the whole fidicinal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of musical instruments. Another evidence of its antiquity, but which tends also to prove that it was not peculiar to Wales, arises from a discovery lately made and communicated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of antiquarians, respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELROSE\">Melrose</a> in Scotland, supposed to have been built about the time of Edward II. It seems that among the outside ornaments of that church there is the representation of a cruth, very little different from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> above given. The instrument is now disused, inasmuch that Sir John Hawkins, from whom we extract, tells us, that there is but one person in the whole principality of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> Wales that can play upon it; and as he was at that time near 60 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, the succession of performers is probably near an end.","sp":409,"ep":409},{"h":"CRUX","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> St Croix, one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARIBBEE_ISLANDS\">Caribbee <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, situated about 60 miles south-east of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PORTO_RICO\">Porto Rico</a>, and subject to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>.

They were introduced into it by a passage which they called Bucarelli's entrance, and which they placed in 55\u00b0 18' N. Lat. and 139\u00b0 15' W. Long. from the meridian of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>. The latitude of this passage as laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by the Spaniards seems to be correct; but the editor of Peroule's voyage concludes, from the survey made by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Cook on the coasts adjacent to the entrance of Bucarelli, that this entrance is about 135\u00b0 20' to the west of Paris, or near 133\u00b0 west of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a>.\n\nThe Spaniards were not long in the harbour of La Cruz before they received a visit from the inhabitants in its neighbourhood. Bartering took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. The Indians gave their peltry, and various trifles, for glass beads, bits of old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, &c. By this traffic the Spaniards were enabled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> a sufficiently exact knowledge of their genius, of their offensive and defensive arms, of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>, &c. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> is a clear olive; many among them have, however, a perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> skin: their countenance is well proportioned in all its parts. They are robust, courageous, arrogant, and warlike. They clothe themselves in one or two undressed skins (with the fur apparently); these are the skins of otters, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-wolves, of benades (a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of deer), of bears, or other animals. Their dresses cover them from the neck to the middle of the leg; some, however, among them wear boots of smooth skin, resembling English boots, only that those of the Indians open before, and are laced tight with a string. They wear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a> woven from the fine bark of trees, which is formed into the shape of a funnel or a cone. At the wrists they have bracelets of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> or iron, or for want of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> the fins of whales; and round the neck, necklaces of small fragments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> of fishes and other animals, and even copper collars of the bigness of two fingers. They wear in their ears pendants of mother-of-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEARL\">pearl</a>, or flat pieces of copper, on which is embossed a resin of a topaz colour, and which are accompanied with jet beads. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> is long and thick, and they make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of a comb to hold it together in a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-QUEUE\">queue</a> from the middle to the extremity; a narrow ribbon of coarse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, woven for this purpose, serves as a ligament. They wear also as a covering a kind of scarf, woven in a particular manner, something more than a yard...\nLa Cruz, and a half long, and about half a yard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, round which hangs a fringe something more than half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of a yard deep, of which the thread is regularly twisted.\n\nThe women give proofs of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> and decency by their dress. Their physiognomy is agreeable, their colour fresh, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a> vermillioned, and their hair long; they plait it together in one long braid. They wear a long robe of a smooth skin tied round the loins, like that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUN\">nun</a>; it covers them from the neck as low as the feet; the sleeves reach down to the wrists. Upon this robe they put <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> skins of otters or other animals to defend themselves from the inclemency of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. All the married women have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> opening in the under lip, and this opening orifice is filled up by a piece of wood cut in an oval shape, of which the smallest diameter is almost an inch; the more a woman is advanced in years the more this curious ornament is extended; it renders them frightful, the old women especially, whose lip, deprived of its wonted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, and dragged by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of this extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEWEL\">jewel</a>, necessarily hangs in a very disagreeable manner. The girls wear only a copper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a>, which crosses the lip in the place where the ornament is intended hereafter to be placed.\n\nThese Indians in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> make use of cuirasses and shoulder pieces of a manufacture like that of the whalebone flays among the Europeans. Narrow boards or scantlings form, in some sort, the woof of the texture, and threads are the warp: in this manner the whole is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a>, and leaves a free use to the arms for the handling of weapons. They wear round the neck a coarse and large gorget which covers them as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as below the eyes, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> is defended by a morion, or skull-piece, usually made of the head of some ferocious animal. From the waist downwards, they wear a kind of apron, of the same contexture as their cuirass. Lastly, a fine skin hangs from their shoulders down to the knee. With this armour, they are invulnerable to the arrows of their enemies; but thus armed, they cannot change position with so much agility as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they were less burdened.\n\nTheir offensive arms are arrows; bows, of which the strings are woven like the large cords of our best musical instruments; lances, four yards in length, tongued with iron; knives, of the same metal, longer than European bayonets, a weapon however not very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> among them; little axes of flint, or of a green <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, so hard that they cleave the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> wood without injury to their edge.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRONUNCIATION\">pronunciation</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> is extremely difficult; they speak from the throat, with a movement of the tongue against the palate. The little use the women make of their inferior lip greatly injures the distinctiveness of their language. The Spaniards could neither pronounce nor write the words which they heard.\n\nFrom the vivacity of spirit in these Indians, and from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> amply to furnish the market established in the harbour, it may be concluded that they are pretty laborious. They continually brought stuffs well woven and shaded with various colours, the skins of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> and sea wolves, of otters, bears, and other smaller animals; of these some were raw, and others dressed. There were to be found at this market also coverlets of coarse cloth, shaded with white and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> colours, very well woven, but in small quantities: large ribbons of the same linen which might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> with that of the Spanish officers' mattresses; skeins of thread such as this cloth was made of; wooden plates or bowls neatly worked; small boats, or canoes, painted in various colours, the figures of which represented heads with all their parts; frogs in wood, nicely imitated, which opened like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a> boxes, and which they employed to keep their trinkets in; boxes made of small planks, of a cubical form, being three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of a yard on each side, with figures well drawn, or carved on the outside, representing various animals; the covers fabricated like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a> clogs, with rabbed edges, formed so as to fit into the body of the box; animals in wood, as well those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> as of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; figures of men of the same material, with skull-caps representing the heads of various fierce animals; snares and nets for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a>; copper collars for the neck, and bracelets of iron for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WRIST\">wrist</a>, but which they would not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> with except at a very high price; beak-like instruments, from which they drew sounds as from a German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUTE\">flute</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> officers took such of these merchandises as were most agreeable to them, and left the remainder to the ships crews.\n\nAs the Indians discovered that the Spaniards were very dainty in their fish, they did not let them want for choice: the greatest abundance was in salmon, and a species of sole or turbot three yards and a quarter long, broad and thick in proportion; cod and pilchards were also brought to market, and fishes resembling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TROUT\">trout</a>. From all this it may be inferred, that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> is full of fish; the banks too are covered with shells.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of mother-of-pearl that these Indians cut to pieces for making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>-rings awakened the curiosity of the Spaniards: they tried to discover whether these people had not in their possession, or whether their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> did not produce pearls, or some precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>: their researches were fruitless, they only found some stones which they judged to be metallic, and which they carried on board, not having the necessary means for extracting the metal they might contain.\n\nThe inhabitants of La Cruz feed upon fish, fresh or dry, boiled or roasted; herbs and roots which their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> yield them, and particularly that which in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> is called sea parsley; and, lastly, upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> of animals which they take in hunting: the productions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a> are undoubtedly abundant, seeing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of dogs they keep for this purpose.\n\nThey appeared to the Spaniards to worship the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, the earliest and most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> of all idolatrous worship; and they paid a decent respect to the remains of their dead. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Maurelle, one of the Spanish officers, in an expedition round the gulf, found in two islands three dead bodies laid in boxes of a similar form to those which have been described above, though considerably larger, and decked in their furs. These biers were placed in a little hut upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PLATFORM\">platform</a>, or raised <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>, made of the branches of trees.\n\nThe country is very hilly; the mountains are lofty, and their slope extends almost everywhere to the sea. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is lime-stone; it is nevertheless covered with an impenetrable forest of tall fir trees, very large and very straight. As these trees cannot strike very deep into the earth, the violence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> often tears them up by\nCrymodes the roots: they rot and become a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> mould, upon which grows a bully thicket; and in this are found nettles, chamomile, wild celery, anife, a species of cabbage, celandine, elder, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WORMWOOD\">wormwood</a>, forrel; and without doubt there are other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>.\n\nThe Spaniards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> ducks, gulls, divers, kites, ravens, geese, storks, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>-finches, and other little birds unknown to them.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> between the Spaniards and the Indians was quite undisturbed; and so defrauded were the latter to obtain iron, cloths, and other stuffs, that they sold their children for broken iron hoops and other wares. The Spaniards in this manner bought three young lads, one from five to six years old, another of four, and the third from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> to ten, not to make slaves, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> of them; they hoped besides to derive useful information from them as to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the country and its inhabitants. These youths were so contented in being with the Spaniards, that they hid themselves when their parents came on board, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of being again restored to them. Two young girls were also purchased with the same view; one very ugly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>; the other younger, better made, but fickle, and almost at the gates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>.\n\nAt the full and change of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, the sea rises in the harbour of La Cruz seventeen feet three inches English; it is then high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> at a quarter after 12 at noon; the lowest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> are fourteen feet three inches; the night tides exceed by one foot nine inches those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>.","sp":409,"ep":411},{"h":"CRYMODES","t":"among physicians, a kind of fever attended with a shivering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, and inflammation of the internal parts of the body.","sp":411,"ep":411},{"h":"CRYPTA","t":"in Anatomy: A name given by Ruyssch to glands situated on the back of the tongue, and to glands of the intestines.","sp":411,"ep":411},{"h":"CRYPTOGAMIA","t":"(from \u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9, occultus, \"concealed,\" and \u03bd\u03cd\u03bc\u03c6\u03b7, nupia, \"nuptials\"), the 24th class in the Linnaean system, comprehending those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> whose fructification is concealed, either through minuteness, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> within the fruit.

Pyramidal crystal with one or two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>. These have no prismatic shape, but either stand upon a base in cavities of quartz veins, have only a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a>,\npyramid, and are of various colours; or they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in clayey earths, and have both pyramids, but no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRISM\">prism</a>. They are found at Blackenburg upon the Hartz, and at Morseroth in the Silverland in Transylvania.\n\nThe coloured transparent crystals derive their tinge from an exceedingly small portion of metallic oxide, but lose them entirely when strongly heated. They are called false gems; viz. the red from Oran in Barbary, false rubies; the yellow from Saxony, false topazes; the green from Dauphiny, very rare, false emeralds or prases; the violet from Vil in Catalonia, false amethysts; the blue from Puy in Valais in France, false sapphires. There are likewise opal or rainbow crystals, the various colours of which are thrown out in zones across the surface. They make a very fine appearance, though they never shine like the oriental opal.\n\nM. Fourcroy makes a remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the crystals and quartz, by affirming that the former are unalterable in the fire, in which they neither lose their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a>, transparency nor colour; while the quartz loses the same qualities, and is reduced by it to a white and opaque earth. He classes the rock crystals,\n\nI. According to their form, viz. 1. Inflated hexagonal crystals ending in pyramids of six faces, which have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> refraction, or show two images of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> when looked through. 2. Hexagonal crystals united, having one or two points. 3. Tetraedral, dodecaedral, flattened crystals; and which, though hexagonal, have nevertheless their planes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>. 4. Crystals in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> masses, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Madagascar, which have a simple refraction.\n\nII. With regard to their colour, as being either diaphanous, reddish, smoky, or blackish.\n\nIII. With regard to accidental changes, some are hollow; some contain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> within one or more cavities; some are cased one within the other; some are of a round form, as the pebbles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a>; some have a crust of metallic calcareous or of pyrites; some are found crystallized in the inside of a cavity; while some seem to contain amianthus or albitus; and others contain flints. The same author reckons among crystals the oriental topaz, the hyacinth, the oriental sapphire, and the amethyst. M. Daubenton has always looked upon this last as a quartz of a crystal.\n\nWhen the rock crystals are semitransparent or intermixed with opaque veins, they are called by the Swedish lapidaries milk-crystals. When they are found in the form of round pebbles, which is occasioned by their being tossed about and rubbed against one another by floods or by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, they are called by the English lapidaries pebble-crystals. They come from the Indies, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>, and other places.\n\nAccording to Bomare, the rock-crystals are generally formed upon or among quartz, which shows their great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a>, and are to be found in all parts of the world. The greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of them is brought from Mount Saint Gothard in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>. Large pieces of these, weighing from 5 to 800 pounds, were found there at Grimselberg; another of about 1200 pounds weight was found some years ago at Fribach in the Valais; and a piece six feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, four wide, and equally thick, was found in the island of Madagascar, where these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> productions are of the most extraordinary size and perfection.\n\nIn the imperial collection at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>, there is a pyramidal crystal vase two ells in height, cut wholly out of one piece. It is usual with the largest crystals of the German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> to be full of cracks and flaws, and to be so constructed internally as to show all the prismatic colours; but the above-mentioned ones were quite free from these blemishes, and resembled columns of the purest glass, only much clearer than any glass can be made. Crystal is also found in many parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>. About Bristol it is found of an amethystine tinge. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILESIA\">Silesia</a> and Bohemia in Germany it is found stained with the colours of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUBY\">ruby</a>, sapphire, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMERALD\">emerald</a>, and topaz; in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> jewellers take great advantage of it, selling it under the name of accidental sapphire.\n\nThe orders of pure crystal are three: the first is perfect columnar crystals, with double pyramids, composed of 18 planes, in an hexangular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a>, terminated by an hexangular pyramid at each end: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> order is that of perfect crystals, with double pyramids, without a column, composed either of 12 or 16 planes, in two hexangular pyramids, joined closely base to base, without the intervention of any column: the third order is that of imperfect crystals, with single pyramids, composed either of 12 or 10 planes, in an hexangular or pentangular column, affixed irregularly at one end to some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> body, and terminated at the other by an hexangular or pentangular pyramid.\n\nThese are all the general forms into which crystal, when pure, is found concreted: but under these there are almost infinite varieties in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, and the length, thickness, and other accidents of the columns and pyramids.\n\nWhen crystal is blended with metalline particles at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of its formation, it assumes a variety of figures wholly different from these, constituting a fourth order, under the name of metalline crystals: when that metal is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, the crystal assumes the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a>; when it is tin, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRILATERAL\">quadrilateral</a> pyramid, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> base; when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, the crystal is found concreted in rhomboidal figures: these crystals are very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>; but the common spars, which are liable to be influenced in the same manner by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, and to appear in the very same form, are to be carefully distinguished from them. There is one very easy test for this purpose, which is, that all spars are subject to be dissolved by aquafortis, and effervesc violently only on its touching them: but it has no such effects on crystal.\n\nThe pebble-crystal is common enough in all parts of the world; but that which is formed of hexangular columns, affixed to a solid base at one end, and terminated by a hexangular column at the other, is infinitely more so: this is what we call sprig or rock crystal, and is the species described by most authors under the name of crystal of the shops, or that kept for medicinal uses.\n\nWith regard to the formation of crystals, it is certain that they must have been once in a soft state, since some are found to have water in their cavities. Professor Bergman obtained 13 regular formed crystals, by suffering the powder of quartz to remain in a vessel with fluor acid for two years. These were about the size of small peas, and were less hard than quartz. Mr Magellan informs us, that he received from Mr Achard\nAchard two crystals, one of the sparry kind, and the other as hard and transparent as rock crystal. The first he procured by means of calcareous earth, and the latter from the earth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>, both dissolved in water impregnated with fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, the water filtrating very slowly through a porous bottom of baked clay. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> is described by the author in the Journal de Physique for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1778; but though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> was attempted by Mr Magellan, and afterwards a second time by Mr Achard himself, neither of them were able to succeed. Mr Morveau, however, in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Dijon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> for 1785, affirms that he has produced a very small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> crystal; and gives the proper method for succeeding in the process.\n\nCrystal is frequently cut; and lustres, vases, and toys, are made of it as of other beautiful stones. For this purpose it is to be chosen perfectly clear and transparent. It is to be tried by aquafortis, or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> it along a pane of glass. The genuine crystal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not be affected by the acid, and will cut glass almost like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a>. When any piece of workmanship of natural crystal is become foul and dark, the following method is to be used for recovering its brightness without hurting the polish. Mix together six parts of common water and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of brandy; boil these over a brisk fire, and let the crystal be kept in it, in a boiling state, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>; then take it out and rub it carefully over with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> dipped in the same liquor; after this it is to be wiped with a napkin, and by that means its surface will be perfectly cleaned, and rendered as bright as at first, without any injury to the points of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> or the polish of the planes or faces, which would probably have happened had the cleaning been attempted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> rubbing with a cloth.\n\nNatural crystal may be reduced by calcination into a state proper for making glass with alkaline salts, and thus becomes a very valuable frit. The method of doing it is as follows: calcine natural crystal in a crucible; when it is red-hot, throw it into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> water. Repeat this eight times, covering the crucible, that no dust or ashes may get in among the crystal. Dry this calcined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, and reduce it to an impalpable powder.\n\nColouring Crystal, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of gems. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLET\">Doublet</a>.\n\nCrystal is also used for a fictitious body, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> in glass-bowls, called crystal-glass, being in fact no more than glass carried, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> and manufacture, to a greater perfection than the common glass.\n\nThe best kind of glass-crystal is that called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>-crystal, made at Moran near Venice. See Glass.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ICELAND\">Iceland</a> or Iceland Crystal, a transparent fissile stone, brought from Iceland, soft as talc, clear as rock crystal, and without colour, remarkable for its unusual refractions. It is a carbonate of lime.\n\nIt is there found in great abundance all over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, but is particularly plentiful in a mountain, not far from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of Rozebord, where the finest and most pellucid pieces are found on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a>. The mountain lies in 65 degrees latitude, and has its whole outside made up of it; but though this makes a very bright and glittering appearance, it is not so fine as that which lies at a little depth, and is met with on opening the surface. This is generally taken up out of the earth in masses a foot long, and its corners very frequently are terminated in these large masses by a sort of crystals, very different in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> and qualities from the rest of the mass. The stone itself is of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLELOPIPED\">parallelopiped</a> figure; but these excrescences are either single pyramids, affixed to columns like common crystal, or double pyramids with or without columns between. The stone itself is soft; these are hard, and cut glass; the stone calcines to lime in the fire; these run into glass; in short, the stone itself is true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAR\">spar</a>, and these are true crystal. Beside these, there sometimes grows out of the end of the larger masses a pure fine asbestos. This likewise is the case sometimes in the spar found about Bareges in France, and shows how nearly together the formation of bodies, wholly different from one another, may happen. The general figure of the stone is parallelopiped; or, as some exposts, rhomboide; and it retains this not only while whole, but also when broken to pieces. Every fragment it naturally falls into, though ever so small, being truly of that shape. But it is remarkable, that in some places of this mountain the same sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> is found in form of triangular pyramids, all which have the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the double refraction with the parallelopipeds of the same substance; so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of supposing its qualities owing to its shape, is refuted by this, as well as by the trials made with other pellucid bodies of the same figure, which do not show this remarkable property.\n\nThe Iceland crystal is electrical, and when rubbed will attract straws, feathers, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> substances, in the same manner that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a> does.\n\nThe vast masses of white spar which are found in the lead mines of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DERBYSHIRE\">Derbyshire</a>, though they are not externally of the parallelopiped figure of the Iceland crystal, nor have anything of its brightness or transparency in the general lump; yet when they are broken they separate into rhomboidal fragments, and some of these are found to be tolerably pellucid; all those which are so have the property of the Iceland crystal; and being laid upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> where a black line is drawn, they all show that line double, in the same manner as the real Iceland crystal does.\n\nIceland crystal bears a red <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> without losing its transparency; and in a very intense heat calcines without fusion; steeped a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> or two in water, it loses its natural polish. It is very soft and easily scratched with the point of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a>; it will not give fire on being struck against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>; and ferments and is perfectly dissolved in aquafortis. It is found in Iceland, from whence it has its name; and in France, Germany, and many other places. In England fragments of other spars are very often mistaken for it, many of them having in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> the same property. It has none of the distinguishing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of crystal; and is plainly a genus of spars, called from their figure parallelopipedia, which, as well as some other bodies of a different genus, have the same properties. Bartholine, Huygens, and Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton, have described the body at large, but have accounted it either a crystal or a talc; errors which could not have happened, had the criterions of fossils been at that time fixed; since Sir Isaac Newton has recorded its property of effervescing with nitric acid, which alone must prove that it is neither talc.\nCRYSTAL\n\ntalc nor crystal, both those bodies being wholly unaffected by that menstrum. It is always found in form of an oblique parallelopiped, with six sides; and is found of various sizes, from a quarter of an inch to three inches or more in diameter. It is pellucid, and not much less bright than the purest crystal; and its planes are all tolerably smooth, though when nicely viewed they are found to be waved with crooked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> made by the edges of imperfect plates. What appears very singular in the structure of this body is, that all the surfaces are placed in the same manner, and consequently it will split off into thin plates, either horizontally or perpendicularly; but this is found, on a microscopic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, to be owing to the regularity of figure, smoothness of surface, and nice joining of the several small parallelopiped concretions, of which the whole is composed; and to the same cause is probably owing its remarkable property in refraction.\n\nThe phenomena of this stone are very remarkable, were first suggested by Bartholin, and have been examined with great accuracy by Mr Huygens and Sir Isaac Newton.\n\n1. Whereas in other pellucid bodies there is only one refraction, in this there are two; so that objects viewed through it appear double.\n\n2. Whereas in other transparent bodies, a ray falling perpendicularly on the surface, passes straight through, without suffering any refraction, and an oblique ray is always divided; in Iceland crystal, every ray, whether perpendicular or oblique, becomes divided into two, by means of the double refraction. One of these refractions is, according to the ordinary rule, the fine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCIDENCE\">incidence</a> out of air into crystal, being to the fine of refraction as five to three; but the other is perfectly new. The like double refraction is also observed in crystal of the rock, though much less sensibly. When an incident ray is thus divided, and each moiety arrives at the farther surface, that refracted in the first surface after the usual manner, is refracted entirely after the usual manner at the second; and that refracted in the unusual manner in the first is entirely refracted after the like manner in the second; so that each emerges out of the second surface <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the first incident ray. Again, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> two pieces of this crystal be placed over each other, so that the surfaces of the one be parallel to the corresponding ones of the other; the rays refracted in the usual manner in the first surface of the first, are refracted after the usual manner in all the other surfaces; and the same uniformity appears in the rays refracted after the unusual manner; and this in any inclination of the surfaces, provided their planes of perpendicular refraction be parallel.\n\nFrom these phenomena Sir Isaac Newton infers, that there is an original difference in the rays of light; by means whereof some are here constantly refracted after the usual manner; and others in the unusual manner. Were not the difference original, and did it arise from any new modifications impressed on the rays at their first refraction, it would be altered by new modifications in the three following ones; whereas, in fact, it suffers no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> at all. Again, he hence takes occasion to suspect, that the rays of light have several sides, endowed with several original properties:\n\nfor it appears from the circumstances, that these are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLINE\">crystalline</a>, not two sorts of rays differing in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> from each other, one constantly, in all positions, refracted in the usual, and the other in the unusual manner; the difference in the experiment mentioned being only in the position of the sides of the rays to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> of perpendicular refraction. For one and the same ray is refracted sometimes after the usual, and sometimes after the unusual manner, according to the position of its sides to the crystal; the refraction being alike in both, when the sides of the rays are posted the same way to both, but different when different. Every ray therefore may be considered as having four sides or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>; two of which, opposite to each other, dispose the ray to be refracted after the unusual manner; and the other two in the usual. These dispositions, being in the rays before their incidence on the second, third, and fourth surfaces, and suffering no alterations; for what appears in their passage through them must be original and connate.\n\nFather Beccaria corrects the observations of Huygens and Newton concerning the refraction of rock or mountain crystal. The double refraction of the latter happens when a ray passes through two sides that are inclined to each other, and consequently illus coloured; whereas that of the Iceland crystal is made by the passage of a ray through two parallel sides, and therefore it illus colourless. He suggests, that there may be other substances in which there is a manifold refraction. Gravestane had a prism of Brafel pebble, which had a double refraction at each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>, but of a different kind from one another. Mr B. Martin prepared several prisms of Iceland crystal, which exhibited not only a double but a multiple refraction. A single prism produced a fixed refraction; and by combining several prisms, a number of refractions was obtained equal to the product of those of the single prisms; i.e. a prism which afforded two images applied to one of six, produced a prism of twelve images, &c. He further observes, with respect to Iceland crystal, that though the sides of its plane of perpendicular refraction be parallel to one another, a beam of light transmitted through them will not be colourless; in which property it differs from all other known substances.","sp":411,"ep":414},{"h":"CRYSTALLINE","t":"in general, something composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> resembling crystal.

It may be conceived, from what has been said on the position of the diagonal OR, why the line e z (fig. 64.), which separates the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> faces of the summit, is situated horizontally, by supposing that the planes have a vertical position.\n\nThe trapeziums d a f e, A p G C, are the result of a decrement by one row on the ridges GO, BR (fig. 66.). The facet d e b a (fig. 64.) arises from a decrement by two rows parallel to the ridge BO (fig. 66.). With regard to the other facet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a> z p, which has the same position as the preceding, in relation to the opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the crystal, it results from an intermediary law, by a row of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> molecules on the angle OBR (fig. 66.). The rhombuses b c l b, k l s u (fig. 67.) represent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> sections of two of these double molecules taken in the same row, and whose relation to the rest of the arrangement will become sensible, by comparing these rhombuses with those marked with the same letters in fig. 65. This variety of crystals is subject to a change of dimensions; the faces p G t e d e z, f a b n k l i b, and their opposites, which are at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> to each other, are elongated in the direction of their breadth, exhibiting the appearance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRILATERAL\">quadrilateral</a>, rectangular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRISM\">prism</a>, the summits of which would be formed by the faces situated towards the ridges PN, Fr. Crystals of this variety, which are opaque, and of a whitish, yellowish, and sometimes reddish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, are found in granites; some are in groups, and some, but more rarely, are met with in single crystals.\n\nIII. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">NUMBER</a> OF PRIMITIVE FORMS.\n\nIn the examples which have been given, the author of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> has chosen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLELOPIPED\">parallelopiped</a> for a nucleus, on account of the simplicity of its form. He has hitherto found that all the primitive forms may be reduced to six. 1. The parallelopiped in general, which comprehends the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RHOMBOID\">rhomboid</a>, and all the solids terminated by five faces parallel two and two. 2. The regular tetrahedron. 3. The octahedron with triangular faces. 4. The hexagonal prism. 5. The dodecahedron with rhomboidal planes. 6. The dodecahedron with isosceles triangular faces.\n\nAmong these forms there are some found as nucleus, which have the measure of their angles the same in different kinds of minerals. It is to be considered that these nuclei are composed, in the first instance, of elementary molecules, and that it is possible that the same form of nucleus may be produced in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> by elements of a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and in another species by different elements combined in a different manner, as we see integrant molecules, some cubic, and some tetrahedral, produce similar secondary forms by the operation of different laws of decrement. But it may be observed, that all the forms which have hitherto occurred as nuclei, on the different species, are such as have a particular character of perfection and regularity, as the cube, the regular octahedron, and the dodecahedron with equal and similar rhombuses for its faces.\n\nIV. FORMS OF THE INTEGRAL MOLECULES.\n\nThe primitive form is that which is obtained by sections made on all the similar parts of the secondary crystal; and these sections, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> parallel to themselves, conduct to a determination of the form of the integral molecules, of which the whole crystal is the assemblage. There is no crystal from which a nucleus in the form of a parallelopiped may not be extracted, by making the limitation to five sections, parallel two and two. In a great number of substances, this parallelopiped is the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, and consequently the real nucleus; but in some minerals this parallelopiped is divisible, as well as the rest of the crystal, by farther sections made in the different directions of the faces, from which results a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>, which will be the nucleus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> all the parts of the secondary crystal superadded to this nucleus are similarly situated. When the mechanical division conduces to a parallelopiped, divisible only by sections parallel to its five faces, the molecules are parallelopeds similar\nStructure of similar to the nucleus; but in all other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> their form differs from that of the nucleus. This may be illustrated by an example.\n\nLet \\(a b s n o\\) (fig. 68.) be a cube, having two of its solid angles \\(a, s\\), situated on the same vertical line; this line will be the axis of the cube, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> \\(a\\) and \\(s\\) will be its summits. Let it be supposed that this cube is divisible by sections, each of which, such as \\(a b n\\), passes through one of the summits \\(a\\), and by two oblique diagonals \\(a b, a n\\), contiguous to the summit. By this section the solid angle \\(s\\) will be detached; and as there are six solid angles, situated laterally, viz. \\(i, b, c, r, o, n\\), the six sections will produce an acute rhomboid, the summits of which will be confounded with those of the cube. At fig. 69., this rhomboid is represented existing in the cube in such a manner, that its six lateral solid angles \\(b, d, f, p, g, e\\), correspond with the middle of the faces \\(a c b i, c r s b, h i n s\\), &c. of the cube; but each of the angles at the summits \\(b a g, d s f, p s f, &c.\\) of the acute rhomboid, are \\(=60^\\circ\\); from which it follows, that the lateral angles \\(a b f, a g f, &c.\\) are \\(=120^\\circ\\). Besides, it is proved by theory, that the cube is the result of a decrement which takes place by a single row of small rhomboids, similar to the acute rhomboid on the six oblique ridges \\(a b, a g, a e, s d, s f, s p\\). This decrement produces two faces, one on each side of each of these ridges, making in the whole 12 faces; but as the two faces, having the same line of ridge for their departure, are on the same plane; by the nature of the decrement, the 12 faces will be reduced to six, which are squares, so that the secondary solid is a cube.\n\nSuppose that the cube (fig. 68.) admits, in regard to its summits \\(a, s\\), two new divisions similar to the preceding six, one of which passes through the points \\(e, i, o\\), and the other through the points \\(b, n, r\\). The first will also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through the points \\(b, g, e\\), and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> through the points \\(d, f, p\\) (fig. 69. and 70.) of the rhomboid; from which it follows, that these two divisions will each detach a regular tetrahedron \\(b a g e\\), or \\(d s f p\\) (fig. 70.), so that the rhomboid will be found converted into a regular octahedron \\(e f\\) (fig. 71.), which will be the real nucleus of the cube; for it is produced by divisions similarly made in relation to the eight solid angles of the cube. If we suppose the same cube to be divisible throughout its whole extent by analogous sections, it is clear that each of the small rhomboids, of which it is the assemblage, will be found in like manner subdivided into an octahedron, and two regular tetrahedrons, applied on the two opposite faces of the octahedron. By taking the octahedron for a nucleus, a cube may be constructed round it, by regular subtractions of small complete rhomboids. If, for example, we suppose decrements, by a single row of these rhomboids, having \\(b\\) for the point of their departure, and made in a direction parallel to the inferior edges \\(g f, e g, d e, d f\\), of the four triangles, which unite to form the solid angle \\(b\\), there will result four faces, which will be found on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>, and like the octahedron, with six solid angles, similar decrements around the other five angles will produce twenty faces, which taken four and four will be equally on a level, making in the whole five distinct faces, situated as those of the cube (fig. 68.). The result will be exactly the same as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of the rhomboid, considered as nucleus.\n\nIn whatever way we proceed to subdivide, either the cube, the rhombus, or the octahedron, we shall always have solids of two forms, that is to say, octahedrons and tetrahedrons, without being able to reduce the result of the division to unity. But the molecules of a crystal being similar, Hauy thinks it probable, that the structure was, as it were, interfered with a multitude of small vacuities, occupied either with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> of crystallization or some other substance; so that, if it were possible to carry the division to its limits, one of those two kinds of solids would disappear, and the whole crystal would be found composed only of molecules of the other form. This view is the more admissible, as each octahedron being enveloped with eight tetrahedrons, and each tetrahedron being in like manner enveloped with four octahedrons, whichever of these forms may be supposed to be suppressed, the remaining solids will join exactly by their edges; so that in this respect there will be continuity and uniformity throughout the whole extent of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>. It may be readily conceived how each octahedron is enveloped with tetrahedrons. By attending to the division of the cube only by the six sections which give the rhomboid, we may depart at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> from any two, \\(a, s; o, b; c, n; i, r\\), of the eight solid angles, provided that these two angles be opposite to each other. But by departing from the angles \\(a, s\\), the rhomboid will be in the position shown at fig. 70. If, on the contrary, we depart from the solid angles \\(o, b\\), these angles will become the summits of a new rhomboid (fig. 72.), composed of the same octahedron as that of fig. 71., with two new tetrahedrons applied on the faces \\(b df, egp\\), (fig. 72.), which were unoccupied on the rhomboid of fig. 70. Fig. 73. represents the case in which the two tetrahedrons repose on the faces \\(db, eg, pf\\) of the octahedron; and fig. 74. represents the case in which they would rest on the faces \\(bf, sg, dp\\). Hence, whatever may be the two solid angles of the cube assumed for the points of departure, we shall always have the same octahedron, with two tetrahedrons contiguous by their summits to these two solid angles; and there being eight of these solid angles, the central octahedron will be circumscribed with eight tetrahedrons, which will rest on its faces. By continuing the division always parallel to the first sections, the same effect will always take place. Each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the octahedron, however small it may be supposed to be, adheres to a face of the tetrahedron, and reciprocally; and each tetrahedron is enveloped with four octahedrons.\n\nThe structure which is here explained is that of fluoate of lime, or fluor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAR\">spar</a>. By dividing a cube of this substance, we may at pleasure extract rhomboids which have the angles formed by their planes equal to \\(120^\\circ\\), or regular octahedrons, or tetrahedrons equally regular. In some other substances, as rock crystal, carbonate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, &c., which being mechanically divided beyond the term at which we should have a rhomboid or a parallelopiped, parts of various different forms are obtained, arranged together even in a more complicated manner than in fluor spar. In consequence of these mixed structures, there is some uncertainty respecting the real figure of the integral molecules.\nStructure of molecules which belong to these substances. It is observed, however, that the tetrahedron is always one of those solids which concur to the formation of small rhomboids or parallelopipeds that would be extracted from the crystal by a first division. But, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, there are substances, which being divided in every possible direction, resolve themselves only into tetrahedrons. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARNET\">Garnet</a>, blende, and tourmaline, belong to this number.\n\nSeveral minerals are divisible into right triangular prisms. Such is the apatite, whose primitive form is a regular right hexahedral prism, divisible parallel to its bases and its planes, from which necessarily result right prisms with three planes. Fig. 76 represents one of the bases of the hexahedral prism, divided into small equilateral triangles, which are the bases of so many molecules, and which being taken two and two, form quadrilateral prisms, with rhombuses for their bases.\n\nBy adopting then the tetrahedron, in the doubtful cases already mentioned, all the forms of integral molecules may be in general reduced to three, which are remarkable for their simplicity, viz., the parallelopiped, the simplest of all the solids, having parallel faces two and two; the triangular prism, the simplest of all prisms; and the tetrahedron, which is the simplest of pyramids. This simplicity may furnish a reason for the preference given to the tetrahedron in fluor spar, and the other substances which have been mentioned as examples. But the ingenious author of the theory cautiously declines to speak decisively on the subject, as the want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> and precise observations, he observes, leaves to theory only conjectures and probabilities.\n\nBut the essential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> is, that the different forms to which these mixed structures lead, are arranged in such a manner, that their assemblage is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to a sum of small parallelopipeds, as has been seen to be the case in regard to fluor spar; and that the laminae of superposition applied on the nucleus, decrease by subtractions of one or more rows of these parallelopipeds. The basis of the theory exists, therefore, independently of the choice which might be made of any of the forms obtained by the mechanical division.\n\nWith the help of this result, the decrements to which crystals are subject, whatever be their primitive forms, are found reducible to those which take place in substances, where this form, as well as that of the molecules, are indivisible parallelopipeds; and the theory has this advantage of being able to generalize its object, by connecting with one fact, that multitude of facts which, on account of their diversity, seem to be little susceptible of being brought to one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> point. But what has been said, will be still more illustrated by examples of the manner in which we may reduce to the theory of the parallelopiped, that of the forms which are different from that solid.\n\nCrystals whose Molecules are Tetrahedrons, with Isosceles Triangular Faces.\n\nGarnet.\n\n1. Primitive Garnet (fig. 76).\n\nGeometric Character.\u2014Respective inclinations of any two of the faces of the dodecahedron, $120^\\circ$. Angles of the rhombus CLGH, C or G = $109^\\circ 28' 16''$; Structure of Crystals. L or H = $78^\\circ 31' 44''$.\n\nNotwithstanding the vitreous appearance in general exhibited on the fractures of garnets of the primitive form, laminae may be perceived on them, situated parallel to the rhombuses which compose their surface. Let us suppose the dodecahedron divided in the direction of its laminae, and for the greater simplicity, let us suppose the sections to pass through the centre. One of these sections, viz., that which will be parallel to the two rhombuses DLFN, BHOR, will concur with a hexagon, which would pass through the points E, C, G, P, I, A, by making the tour of the crystal. A second section parallel to the two rhombuses GLPF, BEAR, will coincide with another hexagon drawn by the points D, C, H, O, I, N. And if the division be continued parallel to the other eight rhombuses, taken two and two, it will be found that the planes of the sections will be confounded with four new hexagons analogous to the preceding. But by refusing all these hexagons, it will appear that their sides correspond, some of them with the small diagonals of the rhombuses of the dodecahedron, viz., those which would be drawn from C to G, from A to I, from C to B, &c., and others would correspond with the different ridges EC, GP, PI, EA, &c.\n\n1. The planes then of the sections passing through the sides and through the small diagonals of the twelve rhombuses, will subdivide the whole surface into 24 isosceles triangles, which will be the halves of these rhombuses. 2. Since the planes of the sections pass also through the centre of the crystal, they will detach 24 pyramids with three faces; the bases of which, if we choose, will be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> triangles that make part of the surface of the dodecahedron, and of which the summits will be united in the centre.\n\nBesides, if we take, for example, the six tetrahedrons, which have for external faces the halves of the three rhombuses CEDL, CLGH, CEBH, these six tetrahedrons will form a rhomboid represented by fig. 77, and in which the three inferior rhombuses DLGS, GHBS, DEBS, result from three divisions which pass, one through the hexagon DLGOR, (fig. 76); the second through the hexagon GHBAF; and the third through the hexagon BEDFPO. Fig. 77 also represents the two tetrahedrons, the bases of which make part of the rhombus CLGH. One of these is marked with the letters L, C, G, S, and the other with the letters H, C, G, S. And by applying what has been said to the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> rhombuses, which are united, three and three, around the points F, A, H, (fig. 77), we shall have three new rhomboids; from which it follows, that the 24 tetrahedrons, considered six and six, form four rhomboids; so that the dodecahedron may be conceived as being itself immediately composed of these four rhomboids, and in the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of 24 tetrahedrons.\n\nIt may be observed, that the dodecahedron having eight solid angles, each formed with three planes, they might have been considered as the assemblage of the four rhomboids, which would have for exterior summits the four angles G, B, D, A; from which it follows that any one of the faces, such as CLGO, is common to two rhomboids, one of which would have...\nWe may remark farther, that a line GS (fig. 77.) drawn from any one G (fig. 76.) of the solid angles composed of three planes, as far as the centre of the dodecahedron, is at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the axis of the rhomboid, which would have its summit in C (fig. 76. and 77.). The composing rhomboids then have this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, that their axis is equal to the sides of the rhombus. From which, with a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, we may conclude, that in each tetrahedron, such as CLGS (fig. 77.), all the faces are equal and similar isosceles triangles.\n\nIf the division of the dodecahedron be continued by sections passing between those which we have supposed to be directed towards the centre, and which should be parallel to them, we should obtain tetrahedrons always smaller, and arranged in such a manner, that taking them in groups of six, they would form rhomboids of a bulk proportioned to their own.\n\nThe tetrahedrons, which would be the term of the division, were it possible to reach it, ought to be considered as the real molecules of the garnet. But it will be seen, that in the passage to the secondary forms, the laminae of superposition, which envelop the nucleus, really decrease by rows of small rhomboids, each of which is the assemblage of these tetrahedrons.\n\nThe sulphuret of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a>, or blende, has the same structure as the garnet. Hauy informs us that he has divided fragments of this substance by very clean sections, in such a manner as to obtain successively the dodecahedron, the rhomboid and the tetrahedron.\n\n2. Trapezoidal Garnet, (fig. 78.).\n\nGeometrical Character.\u2014Respective inclination of the trapezoids, united three and three around the same solid angle D, C, G, &c. $146^\\circ 26' 33''$; of the trapezoids united four and four around the same solid angle, u, v, r, &c. $131^\\circ 48' 36''$. Angles of any one of the trapezoids mD u L, L = $78^\\circ 27' 46''$; D = $117^\\circ 2' 8''$; m or u = $82^\\circ 15' 3''$. The value of the angle L is the same as that of the acute angle of the nucleus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALCAREOUS_SPAR\">calcareous spar</a>.\n\nThis variety is the result of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of laminae, decreasing at the four edges, on all the faces of the primitive dodecahedron. For the more simplicity, let us first consider the effect of this decrement in regard to the rhombus CLGH (fig. 76.). We have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> seen that this rhombus was supposed to belong in common to two rhomboids, which should have for summits, one, the point C, and the other the point G. Let us suppose that the laminae applied on this rhombus decrease towards their four edges by subtractions of a single row of small rhomboids, in such a manner that in regard to the two edges CL, CH, circumstances are the same as if the rhombus belonged to the rhomboid which has its summit in C; and that in regard to the other two edges GL, GH, the effect is the same as if the rhombus belonged to the rhomboid, which has its summit in G. This disposition is admissible here in consequence of the particular structure of the dodecahedron, which permits us to obtain small rhomboids; some of which have their faces parallel to the faces of that with its summit in C, and the rest to that having its summit in G (d).\n\nThe results of the four decrements being thus quite similar to each other, the laminae of superposition, applied on the rhombus CLGH, and on each of the other rhombuses of the dodecahedron, will form as many right quadrangular pyramids, which will have for bases the same rhombuses. Fig. 79. represents the pyramids which rest on the three rhombuses CLDE, CEBH, CGHB (fig. 76.), and which have for summits the points m, e, s, (fig. 76.); but on account of the decrement by a simple row, the adjacent triangular faces, such as EmC, EsC of the two pyramids that belong to the rhombuses CLDE, CEBH, are on a level, and form a quadrilateral EmCs. But we had 12 pyramids, and consequently 48 triangles. These divided by two give 24 quadrilaterals, which will compose the surface of the secondary crystal. But because the rhomboidal bases of the two pyramids extend more, in proceeding from L to E, or from H to E, than in proceeding from D to C, or from B to C, the sides mE, Es of the quadrilateral will be longer than the sides CM, Cs. And besides mE will be equal to Er, and CM equal to Cr. Thus the quadrilaterals will be trapezoids which have their sides equal two and two. There is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLINE\">crystalline</a> form in which the fissure, when they do exist, shew in a more sensible manner the mechanism of the structure than in this variety of garnet. We may here see the series of decreasing rhombuses which form each of the pyramids CLDEm, CEBHs, &c. (fig. 79.), and sometimes the furrows are so deep that they produce a kind of stair, the steps of which have a more particular polish and brilliancy than those of the facets, which are parallel to the faces CEDL, CHBE, of the nucleus.\n\nIf the decrements stop abruptly at a certain term, so that the pyramids are not terminated, the 24 trapezoids will be reduced to elongated hexagons, which will intercept 12 rhombuses parallel to the faces of the nucleus. To this variety Hauy has given the name of intermediary garnet.\n\nIn the sulphuret of zinc the regular octahedron is the result of a decrement by a row around the eight solid angles, composed of three planes, viz. C, B, O, G, F, D, A, I, (fig. 76.). The same substance also assumes the form of a regular tetrahedron, by the help of a decrement by one row on four only of the eight solid angles before mentioned, such as C, O, F, A. The structure of this tetrahedron is remarkable, as it presents an assemblage of other tetrahedrons with isosceles faces.\n\n(d) Theory, the author observes, has conducted him to another result, which is, that the sum of the nucleus and laminae of superposition taken together in proportion as the latter are applied one upon the other is always equal to a sum of rhomboids; though at first view it does not appear that this should be the case, according to the figure of these laminae, which represent rising pyramids.\nHauy has thus denominated the gem which is known under the different names of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUBY\">ruby</a>, sapphire, oriental topaz, according as the colour is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, blue, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>. The different varieties of this gem have not been accurately described, and the nature of the particular angles of each has not been precisely indicated, on account of the rare occurrence of regularly formed crystals, or, when such have been found, on account of their being defaced by being water-worn, or otherwise injured. But from some crystals which were sufficiently characterized, Hauy obtained the following results.\n\n1. Primitive Oriental.\n\nThis mineral crystallizes in the form of a regular hexahedral prism which is divisible parallel to its bases. According to theory, which points out other joinings parallel to the planes, the molecule is an equilateral triangular prism. The height of this prism, calculated by theory, is a little less than three times the height of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> of the base.\n\n2. Elongated Oriental, (fig. 80.)\n\nGeometric Character.\u2014Reflective inclinations of the triangles IAS, IBS, $139^\\circ 54'$. Angles of the triangle IAS, $A = 22^\\circ 54'$, $I$ or $S = 78^\\circ 47'$.\n\nThis form is the result of a decrement by a simple row of small quadrangular prisms on all the edges of the bases of the nucleus. Let $q d$ (fig. 75.) be the superior base, subdivided into small triangles, which represent the analogous bases of so many molecules. The edges of the laminae of superposition will correspond successively to the hexagons $b i l m n r$, $e k u x y v$, &c.; from which it follows that the subtractions take place by rows of small parallelopipeds of quadrangular prisms, composed each of two triangular prisms.\n\n3. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a> Oriental.\n\nGeometric Character.\u2014Dodecahedron formed of two right pyramids less elongated than those of the preceding variety. The triangles corresponding to IAS, IBS, are inclined to each other $122^\\circ 36'$. In each of these triangles the angle of the summit is $31^\\circ$, and each of the angles at the base is $74^\\circ 30'$.\n\nThe law of which this variety is the result, differs from that which produces the preceding, as it determines a mixed decrement by three rows in breadth and two rows in height.\n\n4. Enneagonal Oriental, (fig. 81.)\n\nGeometric Character.\u2014Inclination of each small triangle, such as $e g i$, to the adjacent base $a c i p l b g e d$, $122^\\circ 18'$.\n\nThis is the elongated oriental, whose summits are replaced by two faces, parallel to the bases of the nucleus, with the addition of six (small isosceles triangles $e g i$, $l b f$, $v z m$, &c. the three superior of which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> in position with the three inferior. These triangles are the result of a decrement, by three rows of small quadrangular prisms on the three angles of the superior base of the nucleus, such as $b$, $d$, $g$ (fig. 75), and on the intermediate angles of the inferior base. It may be readily conceived, that in the decrement which takes place, for example, on the angle $g$, the three rows which remain unoccupied between that angle and the corresponding edge of the first lamina of superposition, are, 1. the small rhombus $g o i p$, which alone forms the first row; 2. the two rhombuses $o s t i$, $p z d i$; 3. the three rhombuses situated on the same line behind the two preceding.\n\nCrystals of this gem are chiefly found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEGU\">Pegu</a>. Some have been found in France, which have received the name of sapphires of Puy. They have been also found at a little distance from Velay, on the banks of a rivulet near the village of Expally, where they are mixed with garnets and hyacinths. These have all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> which is denominated oriental sapphire.\n\nV. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">Difference</a> between Structure and Increment.\n\nIn what has been said respecting the decrements to which the laminae of superposition are subjected, the author observes, that it was his view only to unfold the laws of structure; and he adds, that he is far from believing that in the formation of a dodecahedral crystal, or one of any other form, having a cube for a nucleus, the crystallization has originally produced that nucleus such as it is extracted from the dodecahedron, by the successive application of all the laminae of superposition with which it is covered. It seems proved, on the contrary, that from the first moment the crystal is already a very small dodecahedron, containing a cubical nucleus proportioned to its small size, and that the crystal afterwards increases by degrees without changing its form, by new layers which envelope it on all sides, so that the nucleus increases also, preserving always the same relation with the whole dodecahedron.\n\nAn example taken from a plane figure will make this more striking; and what is said respecting this figure may be easily applied to a solid, since a plane figure may be always conceived as a section of a solid. Let ERFN (fig. 82.) be an arrangement of small squares, in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> ABCD, composed of 49 partial squares, represents a section of the nucleus, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> squares R, S, G, A, I, L, &c. that of the kind of layer formed by the laminae of superposition. It may be readily conceived, that the arrangement began with the square ABCD; and that different files of small squares were afterwards applied on each of the sides of the central square: for example, on the side AB, first the five squares comprehended between I and M, next the three squares comprehended between L and O, and then the square E. This increment corresponds with that which would take place if the dodecahedron began by being a cube proportioned to its bulk, and which increased afterwards with the addition of continually decreasing laminae.\n\nBut on the other hand, the arrangement may be conceived to be such as is represented in fig. 84., in which the square $a b c d$ is composed of only nine molecules, and bears upon each of its sides only one square.\nStructure of square e, n, f, or r; and that afterwards by means of crystals, the application of new squares arranged around the former, the affortment has become that of fig. 83, where the central square a' b' c' d' is formed of 25 small squares, and bears on each side of its sides a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILE\">file</a> of three squares, plus a terminating square e', n', f', or r'; and that, in short, by a farther application, the affortment of fig. 83, is converted into that of fig. 82.\n\nThese different transitions will give some notion of the manner in which secondary crystals may increase in bulk, and yet retain their form; and from this it will appear, that the structure is combined with that augmentation of bulk, so that the law, according to which all the laminae applied in the nucleus of the crystal, when arrived at its greatest dimensions, successively decrease, in departing from this nucleus, existed already in the rising crystal.\n\nSuch is the ingenious theory of the structure of crystals, which the author observes, is in this similar to other theories, that it sets out from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> fact, on which it makes all facts of the same kind to depend, and which are only as it were corollaries. This fact is the decrement of the lamina superadded to the primitive form; and it is by bringing back this decrement to simple and regular laws, susceptible of accurate calculation, that theory arrives at results, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of which is proved by the mechanical division of crystals, and by observation of their angles. But new researches are still wanting, in order to ascend a few steps farther towards the primitive laws by which crystallization is regulated. The object of one of these researches would be to explain how these small polyhedrons, which are as it were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of crystals of sensible bulk, sometimes represent the primitive form, without modification; sometimes a secondary form produced in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of a law of decrement; and to determine the circumstances which produce decrements on the edges, as well as those which give rise to decrements on the angles.","sp":432,"ep":438},{"h":"DEFINITION","t":"XI. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> through A, one of the vertices of the transverse axis, a straight line HA b be drawn, equal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to Bb the conjugate axis, and bisected at A by the transverse axis, the straight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> CHM, Cbm drawn through the centre, and the extremities of that parallel, are called Asymptotes.\n\nCor. 1.

All the Cretans were subjected to the power of their magistrates; and divided into two classes, the adults and the youth. Men arrived at maturity were admitted into the first. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> consisted of all the young men who were not below the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of seventeen. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of adults ate together in public halls. There rulers, magistrates, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> and rich, feasted together, partook, without distinction, of the same simple fare. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> bowl, filled with wine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, which went round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> from one to another, was the only drink, that they were allowed. None but the old men had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to call for more wine. Doubtless, that people, celebrated for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, were not strangers to the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>; for a woman was appointed to preside at each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>. She openly distributed the most exquisite meats to those who had distinguished themselves by their valour <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> wisdom. That judicious preference was so far from exciting envy or jealousy, that it only prompted every person to deserve it by brave and prudent conduct. Near where the citizens sat, two tables were laid, which they named Hospitable; all strangers and travellers were entertained at these; and there was also a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> set apart by the public, in which they might spend the night.\n\nTo supply the public expenses, every citizen was obliged to bring a tenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his annual income into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> magistrates were to take care that every person contributed his proportion. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRETE\">Crete</a>, says <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, one part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, of the produce of the flocks, of the revenues of the state, and of the taxes and customs, is sacred to the gods: the other is distributed among the members of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>; so that men, women, and children, all subsist at the public expense.\n\nAfter dinner, the magistrates and senators usually spent some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> in deliberating on the affairs of the state; they next recounted the noble deeds which had been done in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, celebrated the courage of their most distinguished warriors, and animated the youth to heroic valour. Those assemblies were the first school of the youth. At the age of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a>, the boy was permitted to handle the bow;\u2014from that time he was admitted into the society of the adults, where he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till the age of seventeen. There, sitting on the ground, and clothed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> and coarse dress, he served the old men, and listened, with respectful silence, to their advices. His young heart was inflamed with the recital of noble deeds in arms, and glowed with ardour to imitate them. He acquired habits of sobriety and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a>. And being constantly witness of illustrious examples of moderation, wisdom, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a>; the seeds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> were thus sown and fostered in his heart before he attained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of reason.\n\nHe was early accustomed to arms and to fatigue, that he might learn to endure excessive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>,\nto clamber and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAP\">leap</a> among hills and precipices, and to bear manfully the blows and wounds which he might receive amid the gymnastic exercises or in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> was not confined to the gymnastic exercises; he was also taught to sing the laws, which were written in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>, with a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELODY\">melody</a>; in order that the charms of music might dispose him to learn them with more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, and might impress them more deeply on his heart, and that, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he should ever transgress them, he might not have the excuse of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> to offer. He next learned hymns in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the gods, and poems composed in praise of heroes. When he reached his seventeenth year, he retired from the society of the adults, and became a member of that of the young men.\n\nHere his education was still carried on. He exercised himself in hunting, wrestling, and fighting with his companions. The lyre played tunes of martial music; and he learned to follow exactly the sounds and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of the musician. Those sports and exercises were sometimes attended with danger; because arms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> were sometimes used in them. One dance, in which the youth aspired most ardently to excel, was the Pyrrhic, originally invented in Crete. The performers in that dance were arrayed in complete armour\u2014they wore a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> short coat, which did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> below the knee, and was bound with a girdle going twice round the waist: on their feet and legs were buckles; above these they bore their arms, and performed various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> evolutions to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> of musical instruments. \"The Lacedemonians and Cretans (says Libanius) cultivated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a> with amazing ardour; they considered that their laws had directed them to practise it for the most important purposes; and it was scarce less dishonourable for a Lacedemonian or Cretan to neglect the military dances, than to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> in battle.\"\n\nThose Cretans who were opulent and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>-born, were permitted to form <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> of young men of their own age. They often strove, with emulation, who should form the most numerous ones. The father of the young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> who formed one of those societies usually presided in it. He had a right to educate those warlike youth, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> them in running and in hunting, to confer rewards and inflict punishments.\n\nFriendship was in high estimation among the Cretans; but, says Strabo, the manner in which they conducted the intercourse of friendship was pretty extraordinary. Instead of mild persuasion, they made use of violence to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> the objects of their affections. He who conceived an affection for a young man of his own age, and wished to attach him to himself by indissoluble bonds, formed a scheme for carrying him off by violence. Three days before putting it into execution, he communicated it to his comrade. They could not then interfere to prevent it; because if they had, they would have appeared to think the young man unworthy of such an exclusive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a>. At the appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> they assembled to protect their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>. If the ravisher appeared to them not unworthy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his affection, they made at first a faint resistance in obedience to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>\u2014but, at last, joyfully favoured his enterprise; if, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, they thought him unworthy of the object of his choice, they made such resistance as to prevent him from executing his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>. The feigned resistance continued till the ravisher had conducted his friend into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> of that society to which he belonged. They did not regard him who possessed superior beauty and gracefulness of person as the most amiable; but him who had most distinguished himself by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> and valour.\n\nThe ravisher loaded his young friend with favours, and conducted him wherever he desired; they were accompanied by those who had favoured the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAPE\">rape</a>: he carried him from feast to feast, procured him the pleasures of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a> and good cheer; and after using all possible means to gain his heart for the course of two months, brought him back to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>; and was obliged to give him up to his parents. But first he presented him with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> of armour, an ox, and a drinking cup; which were the usual and legal presents on such occasions. Sometimes his generosity went still farther; and he made more expensive presents; to defray the expense of which his comrades contributed. The young man sacrificed the ox to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>, and gave an entertainment to those who had assisted when he was carried off. He then declared his sentiments concerning a connection with his ravisher, and told whether or not it was agreeable to him. If he had reason to complain of the treatment which he had received, the law allowed him to forsake a friend so unworthy of the name, and to demand his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>.\n\nIt would have been disgraceful, adds Strabo, to a young man who was handsome and well born, to be rejected by his friends on account of the depravity of his manners. Those who had been carried off received public honours. Theirs were the first places in the halls and at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>. They were permitted to wear, during the rest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, those ornaments which they owed to the tenderness of friendship; and that mark of distinction testified to all who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> them, that they had been the objects of some fond attachment.\n\nWhen the youth had finished their exercises, and attained the legal age, they became members of the class of adults; being then considered as men, they were permitted to vote in the national assemblies, and were entitled to stand candidates for any public office. They were then obliged to marry: but did not take home their wives till such time as they were capable of managing their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> concerns.\n\n\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a> (says Strabo) had considered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> as the greatest blessing that cities can enjoy. Liberty alone can secure the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the citizens of any state. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">Slavery</a> either robs them of it, or renders it precarious. The first care of nations should therefore be to preserve their liberty. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCORD\">Concord</a> strengthens and supports her empire; she flourishes wherever the seeds of dissension are extinguished. Almost all those hostilities which prevail among nations or individuals <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> either from an inordinate desire of wealth or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a>. Introduce, instead of those baneful principles, frugality, moderation, and equality of conditions; you <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> thus banish envy, hatred, injustice, and haughty disdain.\" This was what the Cretan lawgiver happily effected. And the community, which was regulated by his wise institutions, rose to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, opulence, and power; and was honoured with the panegyrics of the most celebrated philosophers.\nlophers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>; but the highest honour it ever obtained, was that of serving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LYCURGUS\">Lycurgus</a> as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> for the admirable form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> which he established at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPARTA\">Sparta</a>.\n\nThe republic of Crete continued to flourish till the age of Julius Caesar. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> other state has enjoyed so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>. The legislature, regarding liberty as the only sure basis of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>, had instituted a system of laws, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> tendency of which was, to inspire men with an ardent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for liberty, and with such virtue and valour as are necessary to support and defend it. All the citizens were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>; all of them were skilled in the art of war. The valiant youth of other nations flocked to Crete, to learn the exercises, manoeuvres, and evolutions, of the military art. \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOPOEMEN\">Philopoemen</a> (says Plutarch) being impatient of idleness, and eager to acquire skill in arms, embarked for Crete. After spending a considerable time in the noblest exercises among that brave people, who were skilled in the art of war, and accustomed to an austere and temperate life, he returned to the Achaeans. The knowledge which he had acquired made him so eminent among them, that he was immediately appointed general of their cavalry.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the legislator, being persuaded that conquests are generally unjust and criminal, that they often exhaust the strength of the victorious nation, and almost always corrupt its manners, endeavoured to preserve the Cretans from the ambition of conquest. The fertility of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> abundantly supplied their wants. They needed not that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> should introduce among them the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> of foreign countries, along with which luxury and her train of attendant vices would also be introduced; and he knew how to inspire them with an indifference for such acquisitions without expressly forbidding them. The gymnastic exercises, which occupied the leisure of the gallant youth; the pleasures of the chase; the ardour of friendship; the public shows, at which all the different orders of the community, both men and women, used to assemble; the love of equality, order, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, with which he inflamed every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>; the wise institutions, which united a whole nation so closely that they composed but one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>;\u2014all these ties attached the Cretans to their native island; and finding at home that happiness which was the object of their wishes, they never thought of wandering abroad in search of an imaginary glory, or of extending their empire over other nations. Therefore, from the period at which that state assumed a republican form till the time when they were attacked by the arms of Rome, the nation was not once known to send a hostile force into the territories of any of their neighbours. This instance of moderation is unparalleled in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>; no other nation can divide the glory of it with the Cretans. Individuals indeed might leave their country to engage in foreign armies. Those princes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> who knew their valour and skill in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHERY\">archery</a> eagerly sought to take them into their pay; all the neighbouring monarchs were desirous of having in their armies a body of Cretan archers. Over the whole world none were more celebrated than they for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> the bow. \"The arrows of Gortynia (says Claudian), aimed from a trusty bow, are sure to wound, and never miss the destined mark.\"\n\nThough the multitude of independent cities which flourished in Crete did not unite their arms to subjugate the neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, and drench them with the blood of their inhabitants; yet they were not so wise as to live in peace among themselves. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCORD\">Discord</a> often stalked among them with her flaming torch. The most powerful wished to enslave the rest. Sometimes Gnothus and Gortynia marched with social banners against their neighbours, levelled their fortresses, and subjected them to their power; at other times they attacked each other with hostile violence, and saw their bravest youth perish amid the horrors of civil war. Lyctos and Cydon opposed an invincible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> to their ambition, and preserved their own liberty. The last of the cities had acquired such strength and influence, that she held the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> between the rival powers of the island. These wars destroyed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the cities, and drenched the native country of Jupiter with blood.\n\nTo what source must we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> those intestine dissensions? One part of the island was occupied by the Eteocretes, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> inhabitants; the rest was peopled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, Sparta, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARGOS\">Argos</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMOS\">Samos</a>. Perhaps the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> grudges which had subsisted among those strangers, being still unextinguished in their breasts, were easily rekindled by accident or circumstances, and inflamed with new fury. We may also suppose, that the most powerful among them, exulting in their superiority, would endeavour to take advantage of the weakness of the rest, and disregard all laws but those of force: besides, the glowing ardour of the youth, trained to military exercises, was ever ready to fly to arms. Such, probably, were the causes which fomented discord and hostility among a people living under the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, customs, and laws.\u2014Whatever these might be, the Cretans being persuaded that the firm union of their soldiers was essential to victory, arrayed the bravest youths of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> in splendid robes, and caused them to sacrifice to friendship before engaging in battle. In some countries it would be very proper to oblige the generals on such occasions, to sacrifice to concord. If such a sacrifice were performed with sincerity, it might preserve their glory untainted, and prevent such deluges of blood from being wasted without producing any advantages to the state.\n\nTheir passion for war did not extinguish in the breasts of the Cretans that exquisite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> which is the mother and nurse of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FINE_ARTS\">fine arts</a>. \"The Cretans (says Sozomen) gave an illustrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of their munificence to genius, by making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a> a present of a thousand pieces of silver; and to perpetuate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of generosity, they recorded it by an inscription on a public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a>.\" In Crete, adds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>, men are still more devious of cultivating their understandings than of exercising their bodily powers. Often when dissensions arose, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of wisdom and the charms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> recalled them to reason and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THALES\">Thales</a> of Gortynia, the preceptor of Lycurgus, was one of their most celebrated philosophers. Being both a poet and legislator, he made a happy use of his abilities and knowledge to extinguish among\nhis countrymen the kindling sparks of discord. \"His poems were moral discourses in verse, which recalled the people to concord and submission to the laws. Using a regular measure, he recommended the authority of his subject by the infusing and powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a> of sentiment. So powerful were the effects of his verses, which addressed at once the ears, the heart, and the understanding of his hearers, that their rage was gradually softened. Next, opening their hearts to the love of peace, the advantages of which he described in glowing colours, they forgot their intestine dissensions, and ranged themselves around the standard of concord.\" That sage is said to have invented tunes for the military dances and for the Cretan Pyrrhic. Men who felt so strongly the influence of poetry and music could scarcely be enemies to pleasure. Accordingly they had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of distinguishing their fortunate days with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> flint <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, their unfortunate days with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>. At the end of the year they counted the number of their white stones, and reckoned that they had lived only so many days as were distinguished for having been fortunate. They did not think <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> existence, without the enjoyment of pleasure, worthy of the name of life. For this reason, they caused to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> on their tombs: \"He lived so many days; he continued in existence so long.\"\n\nA passion for glory is easily awakened in a feeling and generous breast. The Cretans eagerly repaired to the famous solemnities of Greece, and were often crowned at the Olympic, Nemean, and Pythian games; others of them were favorites of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSES\">muses</a>, and verified the predictions of prophets, or celebrated the glorious deeds of their heroes. Several of them distinguished themselves by historical compositions. At the most ancient games, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> is said to have been bestowed on the poet who sung the noblest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HYMN\">hymn</a> in honour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a>: Chrysothemis of Crete sung and gained the prize.\n\nThe ravages of time have deprived us of almost all their works; and if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PINDAR\">Pindar</a> had not preserved the memory of some of their crowns, we should not know even the names of the conquerors who wore them. The temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIANA\">Diana</a> at Ephesus, built by the Cretan Ctesiphon and his son Metagenes, was not proof against the frantic hand of the incendiary. Those ingenious architects had built it on the principles of the Ionic order; to the coarseness of the materials, the elegance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, the symmetry of the parts, and the majesty and perfection of the whole, they had added solidity and strength, without which the rest must have been of small value. Their names have descended to posterity, but the pillars of that monument which has perpetuated their memory have been defaced or destroyed. Scarce a vestige remains of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> which was esteemed one of the seven wonders of the world.\n\nNations are effaced from the earth like the monuments of their power, and after the revolution of several ages we can scarcely trace in their posterity any remains of their ancient character. Some of them exist longer, others shorter; but we may almost always calculate the period of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> by the excellence of their laws, and the fidelity with which they support and obey them. The republic of Crete, being established on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> basis, knew no foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> for a period of ten centuries. She bravely repelled the attacks of those princes who attempted to enslave her. At length the time arrived when the warlike and victorious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> aspired to the empire of the world, and would suffer none but their subjects or slaves to inhabit within the reach of their arms. Florus does not scruple to acknowledge, that the Romans had no other motives for invading Crete but the ambitious desire of subduing the renowned native country of Jupiter. \"If any person wish to know the reasons which induced us to attack Crete (says he), the true reason was our desire to subdue so celebrated an island. The Cretans had appeared to favour <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MITHRIDATES\">Mithridates</a>, and the Romans thought proper to declare war against them on that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a>. Mark Antony, father of the triumvir, attacked them with strong hopes of success; but was severely punished for his presumption and imprudence. The Cretans took a great part of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, hung up his soldiers and sailors on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASTS\">masts</a> amid the sails and cordage, and returned in triumph into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>.\"\n\nThe Romans never forgot nor forgave a defeat. As soon as the Macedonian war was brought to a happy conclusion, they again took arms against the Cretans to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> their ignominy and loss. Quintus Metellus was sent to Crete with a powerful armament. He met with an obstinate and vigorous resistance. Panarus and Laethines, two experienced leaders, collected a body of 20,000 young warriors, all eager for battle, and of determined courage, employed their arms and arrows successfully against the Romans, and protracted the fate of Crete for three years. Those conquerors could not make themselves masters of the island before destroying its bravest warriors. They lost a great number of troops, and bought a bloody victory at the price of many a danger and much fatigue. However, their usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> at length prevailed. The first care of the conqueror was to abolish the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOS\">Minos</a>, and to establish in their room those of Numa. Strabo, that enlightened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, complains of this act of severity; and informs us, that in his days the original laws of Crete were no longer in force, because the Romans compelled the conquered provinces to adopt their civil code. To secure themselves still more fully in the possession of the island, they sent a powerful colony to Gnoissus.\n\nFrom that era to the present time, that is, for a period of 1900 years, the Cretans have no longer formed a separate nation, or made any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> among the states and kingdoms of the world: their noble and ingenuous manners, their arts and sciences, their valour and their virtues, are no more. They have lost these with the loss of liberty. So true is it that man is not born for himself; and that, when deprived of that aid which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> has designed to strengthen and support his weaknesses, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> of genius and the ardent glow of valour are extinguished in his breast; he becomes incapable of vigorous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>, and sinks below the natural virtue and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of the species.\n\nThe island of Crete, joined with the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYRENE\">Cyrene</a>, on the Libyan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, formed a Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>. It was at first governed by a proconsul; a qu\u00e6stor and an assistant were afterwards sent there; at last, as Suetonius informs us, it was put under the government of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a>. This island was one of the first places in the world that were favoured with the light\nof the gospel. St Paul introduced the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> into Crete; and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> Titus, whom he left there to cherish and cultivate that precious plant, became the first bishop of the island. In the reign of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Leo, it had twelve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, who were all subject to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a> of Constantinople. Constantine separated Crete from Cyrene in the new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> which he made of the provinces of the empire. Leaving three sons, Constansius, Constantine, and Constans, he assigned Thrace and the eastern provinces to the first; to the second, the empire of the west; the island of Crete, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, and Illyria, to the third.\n\nWhen Michael Balbus sat on the throne of Constantinople, the rebellion of Thomas, which lasted three years, caused him to neglect the other parts of the empire. The Agarenians (a people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>), who had conquered the finest provinces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, seized that opportunity. They fitted out a considerable fleet, plundered the Cyclades, attacked the island of Crete, and made themselves masters of it without opposition. In order to secure their conquest, they built a fortress which they named Khandak, \"intrenchment.\" From that citadel the barbarians made incursions into the interior parts of the island, carrying havoc and devastation wherever they appeared. By repeated attacks, they subdued all the cities in Crete except Cydon. Michael made some ineffectual efforts to expel them from Crete. The emperor Basilus, the Macedonian, was not more successful. They defeated him in a bloody battle; but being vanquished by one of his generals, they were subjected to the payment of an annual tribute. At the end of ten years, the Arabians refused the tribute. It was referred for Nicephorus Phocas, who was afterwards emperor, to deliver this fine island from the yoke of the infidels. He landed on the island with a numerous army, boldly attacked them, and routed them in various engagements. The Saracens, no longer daring to meet so formidable a general in the field, fled for protection to their fortresses. Phocas being plentifully supplied with all the warlike <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> necessary for a siege, levelled their walls, and alarmed their hearts with terror. He took their cities and fortresses, and drove them into Khandaq their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> and last resource. In the course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> months he subdued the whole island, took their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> Curup and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> Aremas prisoners, and reunited to the empire a province which had been 127 years in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the infidels. It remained under the dominion of the Romans till the time when Baldwin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a>, being raised to the throne, liberally rewarded the services of Boniface marquis of Montferrat, by making him king of Thessalonica, and adding the island of Crete to his kingdom. That <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a>, being more covetous of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> than glory, sold it to the Venetians in the year 1194; under whom it assumed the name of Candia. See the sequel of its history under that article.","sp":367,"ep":371}]
