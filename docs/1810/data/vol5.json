[{"h":"BURKE","t":"EDMUND, a writer, orator, and statesman, was born in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>, on the 1st <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> in the year 1730. His father was an attorney, first at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMERICK\">Limerick</a>, and afterwards in Dublin. Young Burke received the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> at Ballymore, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KILDARE\">Kildare</a>, under the tuition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a> Shackleton, a Quaker of considerable celebrity. Committed to the care of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> so admirably qualified for the important business of instruction, young Burke applied to his studies with commendable assiduity, and became one of the numerous examples that might be adduced, to demonstrate the falsehood of that popular but dangerous maxim, that young men of genius are always destitute of application.\n\nIn this seminary he laid the foundation of his knowledge in the languages of antiquity; whence he was hereafter to borrow the elegance of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, and the models and imagery of his eloquence. From this source was also, most probably, derived that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, which germinating at certain periods in his bosom, so often pointed his oratory, inflamed his passions, and animated his sentiments; and which in his best days acquired him a reputation almost unequalled in our times.\n\nAt this respectable school several years of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> were spent; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> of the master, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> of the pupil, reflect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> on both. The former lived to see his scholar attain a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of reputation; and he on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> was accustomed to spend a portion of his annual visit to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> at Ballymore.\n\nFrom a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> seminary Edmund was sent to the university of Dublin. Here, however, he does not appear to have distinguished himself either by application <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> talents. His character, as a student, was merely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>. He exhibited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> symptoms of early genius, obtained no palms in the academic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, and departed even without a degree. During this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, however, he commenced author. His first essays were of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>.\n\nMr Burke now addicted himself to other pursuits, particularly logic and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a>; and is said to have planned a refutation of the systems of Berkeley and Hume. While thus employed in treasuring up the means of attaining a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of celebrity, which far different avocations prevented him afterwards from aspiring to, he was not inattentive to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of obtaining a suitable settlement in life; for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> was not opulent, and he already panted after independence. He accordingly became a candidate for a vacant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> at the university of Glasgow. The immediate reason of his failure is not directly known; but on this he repaired to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>, and enrolled his name as a student of the Inner Temple.\n\nIt appears from his speeches, his writings, and his conversation, that he studied the grand outline of our municipal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">jurisprudence</a> with particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>; but it may be doubted whether he ever entered into the minutiae. Indeed the versatility of his talents, and his avocations, were but little calculated for that dull and plodding circuit which can alone <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to an intimate knowledge of our laws. Besides, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he had been gifted with the necessary application, both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> and opportunity were wanting: for it is well known that at this period of his life the \"res angul\u00e6 domi\" did not permit the student to dedicate his attention solely to this, or indeed to any other single object.\n\nThe exhausted state of his finances called frequently for a speedy supply, and instead of perusing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a> of Bracton, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLETA\">Fleta</a>, Littleton, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COKE\">Coke</a>, he was obliged to write essays, letters, and paragraphs, for the periodical publications of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. But if these pursuits diverted his attention from graver studies, they acquired him a facility of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, and a command of style and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, which proved eminently serviceable in the course of his future life.\n\nHis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, however, became at length impaired, and a nervous fever ensued. This circumstance induced him to call in the aid of Dr Nugent, one of his own countrymen, a medical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> whose manners were more amiable than his practice was extensive. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, who had travelled on the continent, and was an author himself, readily discovered the source of his malady, and, by removing him from books and business to his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, soon effected a cure. That event is said to have been hastened, if not entirely completed, by a physician of another kind; the accomplished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOST\">host</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> was destined to become his wife; a circumstance particularly fortunate for him, as her disposition was mild and gentle, and she <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of years, and many vicissitudes of fortune, to soothe and tranquillize passions always violent, and often tumultuous.\n\nOur student seems at length to have determined once more to endeavour to distinguish himself as an au-\nBurke, and he accordingly took advantage of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of a celebrated peer to write a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> after the manner of that nobleman; in which, by exaggerating his principles, he should be enabled to bring them into contempt; but this effort proved unsuccessful, for the treatise in question was for a long time confined to oblivion, and would never have been heard of, had it not been resuscitated by his future <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>. Another performance made ample amends: his \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on the Sublime and Beautiful\" attracted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> degree of reputation, and acquired him considerable celebrity as a man of letters. In addition to the profits of the publication, he is said on this occasion to have received a present from his father of \u00a3100. But his circumstances must have been greatly embarrassed about this time, as he was obliged to sell his books; and surely nothing but the extremity of distress could have forced a man of letters to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>.\n\nThe work we have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned, having an immediate relation to taste, excited a desire in Sir Joshua Reynolds, even then at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of his profession, to become acquainted with Mr Burke; and a friendship ensued which continued uninterrupted during the life of the painter, and was unequivocally testified by a handsome bequest in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>. Dr Johnson also sought and obtained an intimacy with him, and he now became the constant frequenter of two clubs, composed of some of the most celebrated men of that day. One of these met at the Turk's Head tavern in Gerrard-street, and consisted of the following members: Dr Johnson, Mr (afterwards Sir Joshua) Reynolds, Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDSMITH\">Goldsmith</a>, Mr Topham Beauclerc, Dr Nugent, Sir John Hawkins, Mr Bennet Langton, Mr Chamier, Mr Garrick, and Mr Burke.\n\nThe other assembled at the St James's coffee-house, and besides many of the above, was composed of the following members: Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a>, Dr Douglas bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALISBURY\">Salisbury</a>, Dr Bernard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAN\">dean</a> of Derry, Mr Richard Burke, Mr William Burke, Mr Hickey, &c. Dr Goldsmith, who was Mr Burke's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> at Dublin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, was a member of both, and wrote the epitaphs of those who composed the latter. That on Mr Burke has often been praised.\n\nHere lies our good Edmund, whose genius was such,\nWe scarcely can praise it or blame it too much;\nWho, born for the universe, narrow'd his mind,\nAnd to party gave up what was meant for mankind.\nThough fraught with all learning, yet straining his throat\nTo persuade Tommy Townshend to lend him a vote;\nWho, too deep for his hearers, still went on refining,\nAnd thought of convincing while they thought of dining;\nThough equal to all things, for all things unfit,\nToo nice for a statesman, too proud for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>;\nFor a patriot too cool; for a drudge disobedient;\nAnd too fond of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, to pursue the expedient.\nIn short, 'twas his fate, unemployed or in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, sir,\nTo eat mutton <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, and cut blocks with a razor.\n\nA literary work on a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, first suggested in 1750, and by some attributed to the Dodleys, and by others to Mr Burke, became, for some time, a considerable source of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a> to him. This was called the \"Annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">Register</a>,\" a publication that soon obtained considerable celebrity, and of which he had the superintendence for several years.\n\nHe was, at length, called off from his literary labours by avocations of a far different kind. A gentleman who afterwards derived the cognomen of \"linguist <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a>,\" from a celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORATION\">oration</a>, having been appointed secretary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> of Ireland, invited his friend Mr Burke to accompany him thither; this offer he readily complied with, and although he acted in no public station, and performed no public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> while he remained in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, he was rewarded with a pension of \u00a3300 per annum, which he soon after disposed of for a sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>.\n\nOn his return to England he amused himself, as usual, with literary composition. A series of essays written by him in a newspaper, which, at one time, obtained great celebrity, attracted the notice of the late marquis of Rockingham; and Mr Fitzherbert, a member of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, and father of the present Lord St Helen's, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this circumstance, introduced him to that nobleman. From this moment he was destined to become a public man, and to dedicate his studies, his eloquence, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a>, to politics.\n\nLord Rockingham having proved more compliant than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHATHAM\">Chatham</a>, the former nobleman was brought into power, and seated on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENCH\">bench</a>. On this occasion he selected Mr Burke as his private secretary, an office of no power and very little emolument, but which naturally leads to both. As it was now necessary he should have a seat in parliament, although it cannot be supposed that he was legally qualified in respect to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, he applied to Lord Verney, who was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WENDOVER\">Wendover</a>, a borough at that time dependent on him, and principally occupied by his tenants.\n\nHaving thus obtained a seat in 1765, he prepared to fit himself for his new situation. He was already provided with all the necessary talents, and was only deficient in the forms of business, and the facility of expressing his sentiments before a public audience. The first of these was mastered by sedulous attention; and as to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, if we are to give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to those who pretend to be intimately acquainted with this period of his life, he overcame all difficulties by a previous initiation elsewhere. In short he had acquired celebrity at the \"Robinhood,\" before he attempted to speak in the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>, and vanquished an eloquent \"baker\" ere he began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPE\">cope</a> with the great orators of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>.\n\nHolding a confidential place under the Rockingham administration, he of course supported all its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>. A former ministry, anxious to increase its influence by means of increased imposts, had conceived the idea of taxing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> through the medium of a parliament in which she was not represented. Having attempted to carry this into effect by means of the famous stamp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, the Americans, alarmed at what they conceived to be a flagrant violation of every principle of the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, made such a spirited resistance to the measure that it was abandoned, and the Rockingham party readily consented to the repeal. Under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a>, however, of vindicating the honour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, they unfortunately proposed and carried the declaratory\nclaratory act, by means of which, although the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> scheme had been abandoned, the principle on which it was built was affected anew, and a foundation laid for all the miseries that afterwards ensued. But if this short-lived administration deserved no great credit on this occasion, it is entitled to considerable praise on account of other parts of its conduct; for it repealed the cider act, procured a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> of the house of commons condemning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZURE\">seizure</a> of papers, and a revolution against general warrants. The first of these afforded great relief to such of the counties as cultivated orchard grounds, and the two last seemed to be called for by the conduct of their predecessors in respect to Mr Wilkes.\n\nOn retiring from office they, however, did not carry much popularity along with them, as Lord Chatham and his friends, who in some measure monopolized the public favour, were entrusted with the management of affairs for a short time; and it is extremely probable that they would have sunk into neglect, had not America been driven into resistance.\n\nIt now fell to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> of Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> to enforce the scheme which the Grenville party had projected, and wished to carry boldly into execution; which the Rockingham administration had by an unaccountable blunder at once annihilated and recognized, and which they afterwards manfully, and at length successfully opposed.\n\nThis forms the most brilliant epoch of Mr Burke's life. He was hostile to the expulsion of Mr Wilkes; an act which the house of commons afterwards rescinded from its records. On the application of the dissenters for relief, he took up their cause, and expressed his resentment, in very animated terms, against that misguided policy, which permits all those not within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> of establishment to enjoy liberty less by right than by connivance. But perhaps the noblest part of his conduct consisted in his steady and uniform opposition to the American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, and his marked and declared hostility to the abettors of it. His speech against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOSTON\">Boston</a> Port <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">Bill</a> was one of the most charming specimens of oratory that had ever been exhibited in the British senate; and on the 19th of April, 1774, on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> for the repeal of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a> duty, he discovered such talents, that an old and respectable member exclaimed, \"Good God! what a man is this!\u2014How could he acquire such transcendent powers?\" And when, in reply to another who had said, \"That the Americans were our children, and it was horrible to revolt against their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a>,\" the orator uttered the following passage, the whole house was electrified:\n\n\"They are our children, it is true; but when children ask for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, we are not to give them a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>. When those children of ours wish to affiliate with their parent, and to respect the benevolent countenance of British liberty, are we to turn to them the shameful parts of our constitution? Are we to give them our weaknesses for their strength; our opprobrium for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>; and the flough of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>, which we are not able to work off, to serve them for their freedom.\"\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> of which had become rich by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> with America, were likely to suffer by its interdiction. This consideration alone rendered many of them hostile to the proceedings of the ministry; but nobler and more exalted motives actuated the bosoms of others, particularly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUAKERS\">Quakers</a>, Dissenters, and other sectarians, who were moved by zeal against oppression, and a love of liberty imprinted on their minds by a constitution which had remained until then inviolate. Grateful by the exertions of Mr Burke in behalf of civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> freedom, they put him in nomination for their city, and sent into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>, to request his immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> attendance. After consulting with his patron concerning an offer so flattering and unexpected, accompanied at the same time with assurances most punctually fulfilled, that he should be put to no expense whatever, he immediately set out for the west of England, and found that no less than three candidates had started before him. The first was Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLARE\">Clare</a>, afterwards Lord Nugent, one of the former representatives, whose unpopularity was such, that he soon discovered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of resigning all his pretensions; two, therefore (Mr Cruger and Mr Brickdale), only remained in the field, and the former of these, like Mr Burke himself, was adverse to a rupture with America.\n\nThe new candidate did not appear on the hustings until the afternoon of the sixth day's poll, on which occasion he addressed the electors in a very able speech, admirably calculated for the occasion. He began by expressing a modest diffidence of his own abilities, and a high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of the important trust they were assembled to confer. He then boldly declared himself hostile to a contest with America, and asserted, that England had been rendered flourishing by liberty and commerce, the first of which was dear to his heart, while the latter had been a favourite object of his studies, both in its principles and details.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARANGUE\">harangue</a> was well received by the electors; the contest proved propitious to his wishes; and when the sheriffs had notified, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the poll, that he was elected, he made the most brilliant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> on the occasion that had ever been heard within the walls of a city celebrated rather for its opulence than its eloquence.\n\nMr Burke immediately returned from his new constituents to parliament, with increased vigour, reputation, and zeal. The earl of Chatham, having failed, notwithstanding his reputation for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, in an attempt to adjust the troubles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> by means of a conciliatory bill introduced by him into the house of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEERS\">peers</a> for that purpose, the obstinacy of the ministry now became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> to every one. This circumstance, which would have appalled an inferior man, did not, however, discourage the member for Bristol from a similar attempt in another place; and accordingly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 22, 1775, he brought forward his thirteen celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>, which were intended to close the fatal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a>, and heal all the differences between the mother country and her colonies.\n\nHis plan, on this occasion, embraced not only an immediate conciliation, by a repeal of the late coercive acts, but also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> of an independent judiciary, and the regulation of the courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRALTY\">admiralty</a>. The whole, however, was quashed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> majority on the side of the minister, who moved the previous question.\nMr Burke had hitherto chiefly distinguished himself in opposition to the measures of others; but in 1782, he himself stood forth as the original author and proposer of a scheme which soon engaged the attention of the public, and actually appeared big with the most prosperous results. When he found ministers obstinately persisting in a disastrous war, and perceived that the people began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> beneath the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of the taxes for its support, it struck him as advantageous on one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and political on the other, to diminish the public burdens and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of adherents to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> at the same time. Accordingly, on the 11th of February, he brought in a bill \"for the regulation of his majesty's civil establishments, and of certain public offices; for the limitation of pensions, and the suppression of sundry useless, expensive, and inconvenient places, and for applying the monies saved thereby to the public service.\"\n\nThis scheme was manifestly founded on the late reforms that had taken place in France; for by an edict of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, registered in the parliament of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, it appeared that he had supprest more than 456 places in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a> by one regulation. The orator, with great judgment, fastened upon this event, and endeavoured to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of it as an incitement to a similar attempt here; nay he called in national rivalry itself, by way of an inducement to consent to this sacrifice on the part of the crown.\n\nTo this bill the minority did not at first give much opposition. Indeed the mover of it contrived to soften those features that appeared harsh to them. Notwithstanding this, it did not prove successful during Lord North's administration; and when it was at length carried, it was much modified and altered.\n\nParliament was dissolved in 1782, but Mr Burke was not re-elected for Bristol, and this is said to have made a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on the mind of the orator; but this must have been obliterated by the important events that speedily ensued; for the minister now tottered on the treasury bench, being abandoned by many of his staunchest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPORTERS\">supporters</a>, and but little confident in his own schemes, all of which had proved eminently unsuccessful.\n\nThe opposition, having by this time increased to a considerable degree, unceasingly assailed him, until at length, March 28, 1782, Lord North assured the house of commons, that his administration was at an end.\n\nThe day had now arrived when the ministry and opposition were to change places, and the former to be arrayed in the spoils of the latter. Of this rich booty Mr Burke, whose services had been so conspicuous in hunting the enemy into the toils prepared for them, had his portion: for he was made a privy counsellor, and invested with the lucrative appointment of paymaster-general of the forces. He was at length now enabled to enforce his plan of political economy, tendered before in vain; and the board of trade, the board of works, the offices of third secretary of state, treasurier of the chamber, cofferer of the household, the lords of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a> in Scotland, the master of the harriers, the master of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a> hounds, the six clerks of the board of green cloth, and the paymaster of the pensions, were abolished.\n\nAt length the reins of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> were confided to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the marquis of Lansdowne, then earl Burke, Shelburne; and this event gave such offence to those who wished to place the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Portland at the head of affairs, that Mr Fox, Lord John Cavendish, and Mr Burke, immediately resigned.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, the critical state of the English East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a> had long agitated the public mind, and become occasionally a subject of discussion in parliament. The seizure, imprisonment, and confinement of Lord Pigot, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MADRAS\">Madras</a>; the conduct of Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HASTINGS\">Hastings</a>, in respect to several of the native powers; the grand question of sovereignty, relative to the territorial possessions of the company in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>: all these subjects had, at different times, excited the attention of the nation.\n\nNo sooner did Mr Fox behold himself and his friends in possession of power, than he brought in a bill, to remedy the various abuses in the government of British India. Of this bill Mr Burke is well known to have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> penman, and upon this occasion he defended its principles and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> with all the zeal of a parent. In a speech of considerable length he exhibited an able retrospect of the system, both political and commercial, of the company. He then proceeded to state the benefit likely to result from the plan under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a>, which he considered as calculated to effect \"the rescue of the greatest number of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> race that ever were so grievously oppressed, from the greatest tyranny that ever was exercised.\" In short, he contemplated it as a measure that would \"secure the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a> in his pot to every man in India,\" \"I carry my mind (adds he) to all the people, and all the names and descriptions that, relieved by this bill, will bless the labours of this parliament, and the confidence which the best house of commons has given to him who best deserves it.\"\n\nThis celebrated bill, notwithstanding much opposition both within and without, was carried triumphantly through the house of commons; but in the house of peers it experienced a far different fate, and with it fell the power and consequence of its authors, framers, and supporters.\n\nIn the course of the next year (February 28, 1783), he made a celebrated speech relative to the nabob of Arcot's debts; and depicted one of his creditors, who had taken an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> share in the late elections, \"as a criminal who long since ought to have fattened the region kites with his offal; the old betrayer, infilter, oppressor, and scourge, of a country (Tanjore), which had for years been an object of an unremitting, but unhappily unequal, struggle, between the bounties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a> to renovate, and the wickedness of mankind to destroy.\"\n\nBut there appeared to Mr Burke to be a still greater delinquent, on whom he was determined to inflict all the wounds of his eloquence, and sacrifice, if possible, the powerful offender himself at the shrine of national vengeance. This was Mr Hastings; and soon after his arrival in England, the orator gave notice of his intentions. On the 17th of February, 1785, he opened the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a> by a most eloquent speech; in which he depicted the supposed crimes of the late governor-general, in the most glowing and animated colours. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, however, turned out in the event far\nBurke, far different from his hopes and expectations; while the length of it failed not to involve both himself and party in reproach.\n\nDuring the debate on the commercial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> with France (January 23, 1787), the member for Malton exhibited an undiminished versatility of talents, and pointed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> with no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> success at Mr Pitt, who, according to him, contemplated the subject with a narrowness peculiar to limited minds:\n\n\"He seems to consider it (adds he) as an affair of two little compting-houses, and not of two great nations. He seems to consider it as a contention between the sign of the fleur-de-lis and the sign of the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> lion, for which should obtain the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>.\"\n\nThe next public event of importance in which we find Mr Burke engaged, occurred in consequence of his majesty's indisposition. On this occasion he took an active part in the debates of the house of commons; and is supposed to have penned a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> for one, and a speech for another, branch of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> family. When Mr Pitt moved his declaratory resolutions relative to the provisional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of the royal authority, he attacked him with much alacrity of language, and was particularly severe on the manner in which the royal assent was to be given to all future acts of parliament. The men who held most of the high places under the government were treated as \"jobbers, old hacks of the court, and the supporters and betrayors of all parties; and it was a mock crown, a tinsel robe, and a sceptre from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>, lacquered over and unreal,\" which were about to be conferred on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>.\n\nThe opposition, lessened indeed by a few occasional defections, had hitherto acted as a great public body, supposed to be united in general principles, for the common welfare and prosperity of the state; but the French revolution thinned their ranks, dispelled their consequence, and, by sowing jealousy between the chiefs, spread consternation and dismay among their followers.\n\nIt was on the 2d of March 1790, when Mr Fox moved for leave to bring in a bill to repeal the corporation and test-acts, that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> became evident; and soon after this Mr Burke declared, \"that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> friend and he were separated in their politics for ever.\"\n\nThe ministry now seemed anxious to provide for their new associate; and he, on his part, certainly appeared deserving of some remuneration at their hands, for he had abandoned all his old friends, and not a few of his old principles. In addition to this, his \"Reflections on the Revolution in France,\" had afforded some degree of countenance, and even popularity, to the measures of administration; and, not content with his own exertions, he had enlisted his son on the same side, and even sent him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COBLENZ\">Coblenz</a>. The royal munificence at length gratified his warmest wishes; for by a warrant, dated September 24, 1795, and made to commence January 5, 1793, he received a pension of \u00a31200l. for his own life, and that of his wife, on the civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a>; while two other pensions of \u00a3500l. a-year for three lives, payable out of the four and a half per cent. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a>, dated October 24, 1795, were made to commence from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 24, 1793. Honours as well as wealth now seemed to await him, for he was about to be ennobled, when the untimely death of an only child put an end to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> of ambition, and contributed not a little to hasten his own, which occurred at his house at Beaconsfield, July 8, 1797.\n\nThus died, in the 68th year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, Edmund Burke, one of the greatest orators, statesmen, and authors, of his age; one whose name will long continue to be celebrated; and who, had he fallen during the meridian of his fame and character, would have scarcely been considered as second to any man, either of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times.\n\nAs a man of letters, he ranks high in point of genius, learning, and composition; and his works are attended with this peculiarity, that they are the production of almost the only orator of his day, who could wield his pen with as much fluency as his tongue, and shine equally in the senate and the closet. His dissertation on the \"Sublime and Beautiful\" acquired him the applause of all, and secured him the friendship and affluence of many men of taste in the nation. His political tracts betoken much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a>, deep thought, uncommon sagacity; and even those who may be disposed to object to his doctrines, cannot but admire his various talents, his happy allusions, and his acute penetration. There is no species of composition which he has not attempted; no subject on which he has not occasionally treated: his first and his last days were equally dedicated to literature, and he disdained not any species of it, from the newspaper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a>, that supplied needful bread to his early youth, to the more elaborate performance that procured unnecessary opulence to his old age.\n\nAs an orator, notwithstanding some glaring defects, he stands almost unrivalled. His gesticulation was at times violent and repulsive, his manner harsh and overbearing, his epithets coarse and disgusting; on many occasions he made use of assertions which were not bottomed in fact, and on one in particular, toward the latter end of his life, had recourse to stage trick and pantomime, instead of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> and argument. But on the other hand, no man was better calculated to arouse the dormant passions, to call forth the glowing affections of the human heart, and to \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARROW\">harrow</a> up\" the immortal recesses of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>. Venality and meanness stood appalled in his presence; he who was dead to the feelings of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>, was still alive to his animated reproaches; and corruption for a while became alarmed at the terrors of his countenance. His powers were never more conspicuous than on that memorable day on which he exposed the enormities of a subaltern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> of oriental despotism\u2014on which he depicted the tortures inflicted by his orders, the flagrant injustice committed by his authority, the pollution that ensued in consequence of his sanction\u2014when he painted agonizing nature vibrating in horrid suspense between life and destruction\u2014when he described, in the climax of crimes, \"death introduced into the very sources of life,\" the bosoms of his auditors became convulsed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, and those of more delicate organs and weaker frame actually swooned away. Nay, after the storm of eloquence had spent its force, and the captivated ears no longer listened to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, his features still spoke the purpose of his heart, his hand still seemed to threaten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, and his brow to meditate vengeance.\n\"The qualities of his heart (says one of his biographers) were not less amiable and estimable than his talents were astonishing:\u2014benevolent, just, temperate, magnanimous. He loved his country, loved its constitution, because he believed it the best adapted for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>: at different times, from the same principle, he supported different members of it, when he thought the one or the other likely to be overbalanced. During the prevalence of the Bute plans, dreading the influence of the crown, he supported the people; and for the same reason, during the American war.\n\n\"After the overthrow of the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>, the aristocracy, and the dissemination in Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> of the principles that had destroyed their powers, apprehending similar effects, if not vigourously opposed in England, he strenuously supported the monarchy and aristocracy. Thus indiscriminately patriotic in public life, in his private relations his conduct was highly meritorious. A fond and attentive husband, an affectionate and judiciously indulgent father, a sincere friend, at once fervid and active, a liberal and kind master, an agreeable neighbour, a zealous and bountiful patron, he diffused <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and happiness. His principles were as strict, and habits as virtuous, as his dispositions were kind.\" (Annual Necrology).","sp":1,"ep":10},{"h":"BURKIT","t":"WILLIAM, a celebrated commentator on the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, was born at Hitcham in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHAMPTONSHIRE\">Northamptonshire</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 25, 1670, and educated at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEMBROKE\">Pembroke</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>.

Boileau, the author, turns the subject into ridicule, by dressing it in the heroic style, and affecting to consider it as of the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> and importance.

The opposition between the subject and the manner of handling it, is what produces the ridicule; and therefore, in a composition of this kind, no image professedly ludicrous ought to have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, because such images destroy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a>.\n\nThough the burlesque that aims at ridicule produces its effects by elevating the style far above the subject; yet the poet ought to confine himself to such images as are lively, and readily apprehended.

As there was some disparity in their ages, that it might remain past dispute that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> was wholly owing to inclination, and not to avarice <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> ambition, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> before their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> our author delivered the lady a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a>, whereby he renounced all pretensions to her fortune, which was very considerable, and must otherwise have fallen into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, she herself having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> intention to secure it. The same year he published his \"Vindication of the authority, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, and laws of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> and state of Scotland;\" which at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a> was looked upon as so great a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, that he was again offered a bishopric, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> of the next vacant archbishopric; but did not accept of it, because he could not approve of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> view of which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> to be the advancement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPERY\">Popery</a>.\n\nMr Burnet's intimacy with the dukes of Hamilton and Lauderdale occasioned him to be frequently sent for by the king and the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, who had conversations with him in private. But Lauderdale conceiving a resentment against him on account of the freedom with which he spoke to him, represented at last to the king, that Dr Burnet was engaged in an opposition to his measures. Upon his return to London, he perceived that these suggestions had entirely thrown him out of the king's favour, though the duke of York treated him with greater civility than ever, and dissuaded him from going to Scotland. Upon this, he resigned his professorship at Glasgow, and stood at London. About this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the living at Cripplegate being vacant, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAN\">dean</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of St Paul's (in whose gift it was), hearing of his circumstances, and the hardships he had undergone, sent him an offer of the benefice; but as he had been informed of their first intention of conferring it on Dr Fowler, he generously declined it. In 1675, at the recommendation of Lord Hollis, whom he had known in France, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> at that court, he was, by Sir Herbottle Grimstone, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the rolls, appointed preacher of the chapel there, notwithstanding the opposition of the court. He was soon after chosen a lecturer of St Clement's, and became one of the preachers that were most followed in town. In 1697, he published his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of the Reformation, for which he had the thanks of both houses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of it was published in 1679, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> in 1681. Next year he published an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ABRIDGMENT\">abridgment</a> of these two parts.\n\nMr Burnet about this time happened to be sent for to a woman in sickness, who had been engaged in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMOUR\">amour</a> with the earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROCHESTER\">Rochester</a>. The manner in which he treated her during her illness, gave that lord a great curiosity for being acquainted with him. Whereupon, for a whole winter, he spent one evening in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> with Dr Burnet, who discoursed with him upon all those topics upon which sceptics and men of loose morals attack the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. The happy effect of these conferences occasioned the publication of his account of the life and death of that earl. In 1682, when the administration was changed in favour of the duke of York, being much referred to by persons of all ranks and parties, in order to avoid returning visits, he built a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LABORATORY\">laboratory</a>, and went for above a year through a course of chemical experiments. Not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> after, he refused a living of 300l. a-year offered him by the earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSEX\">Essex</a>, on the terms of his not residing there, but in London. When the inquiry concerning the popish plot was on foot, he was frequently sent for and consulted by King Charles with relation to the state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>. His majesty offered him the bishopric of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHICHESTER\">Chichester</a>, then vacant, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he would engage in his interests; but he refused to accept it on these terms. He preached at the Rolls till 1684, when he was dismissed by order of the court. About this time he published several pieces.\n\nOn King James's accession to the throne, having obtained leave to go out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, he first went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, and lived in great retirement, till contracting an acquaintance with Brigadier Stouppe, a Protestant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> in the French service, he made a tour with him into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>. He met with an agreeable reception at Rome. Pope Innocent XI, hearing of our author's arrival, sent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a> of the Swiss guards to acquaint him he would give him a private audience in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, to avoid the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> of kissing his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a>'s flipper. But Dr Burnet excused himself as well as he could. Some disputes which our author had here concerning religion\nBurnet. religion, beginning to be taken notice of, made it proper for him to quit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>; which, upon an intimation given him by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> Borghefe, he accordingly did.\n\nHe pursued his travels through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a> and Germany. In 1688, he came to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UTRECHT\">Utrecht</a>, with an intention to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> provinces. There he received an invitation from the prince and princess of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a> (to whom their party in England had recommended him) to come to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAGUE\">Hague</a>, which he accepted. He was soon made acquainted with the secret of their counsels, and advised the fitting out of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> in Holland sufficient to support their designs and encourage their friends. This, and the Account of his Travels, in which he endeavoured to blend Popery and tyranny together, and represent them as unseemly, with some papers reflecting on the proceedings of England, that came out in single sheets, and were dispersed in several parts of England, most of which Mr Burnet owned himself the author of, alarmed King James; and were the occasion of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> twice against him to the princes of Orange, and insisting, by his ambassador, on his being forbid the court; which, after much importunity, was done, though he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be trusted and employed as before, the Dutch minister consulting him daily. To put an end to these frequent conferences with the ministers, a prosecution for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a> was set on foot against him both in England and Scotland. But Burnet receiving the news thereof before it arrived at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a>, he avoided the storm, by petitioning for, and obtaining without any difficulty, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> of naturalization, in order to his intended marriage with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> Scott, a Dutch lady of considerable fortune, who, with the advantage of birth, had those of a fine person and understanding.\n\nAfter his marriage with this lady, being legally under the protection of Holland, when Mr Burnet found King James plainly subverting the constitution, he omitted no method to support and promote the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> the prince of Orange had formed of delivering Great Britain, and came over with him in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of chaplain. He was soon advanced to the see of Salisbury. He declared for moderate measures with regard to the clergy, who scrupled to take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a>, and many were displeased with him for declaring for the toleration of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NONCONFORMISTS\">nonconformists</a>. His pastoral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> concerning the oaths of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> and supremacy to King William and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> Mary, 1689, happening to touch upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of conquest, gave such offence to both houses of parliament, that it was ordered to be burnt by the hands of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> executioner. In 1698 he lost his wife by the smallpox; and, as he was almost immediately after appointed preceptor to the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLOUCESTER\">Gloucester</a>, in whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> he took great care, this employment, and the tender age of his children, induced him the same year to supply her loss by a marriage with Mrs Berkeley, eldest daughter of Sir Richard Blake, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a>. In 1699 he published his Exposition of the 39 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>; which occasioned a representation against him in the lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVOCATION\">convocation</a> in the year 1701; but he was vindicated in the upper house. His speech in the house of lords in 1704 against the bill to prevent occasional conformity was severely attacked. He died in 1715, and was interred in the church of St James, Clerkenwell, where he has a monument erected to him. Burnet. He formed a scheme for augmenting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> livings; which he pressed forward with such success, that it ended in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of parliament passed in the second year of Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>, \"for the augmentation of the livings of the poor clergy.\"\n\nBurnet, Thomas, a polite and learned writer in the end of the 17th century, was born in Scotland, but educated in Cambridge under the tuition of Mr John Tillotson, afterwards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTERBURY\">Canterbury</a>. In the beginning of 1685, he was made master of Sutton's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a> in London, after which he entered into holy orders. During the reign of King James, he made a noble stand in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> as master of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a>-house against the encroachments of that monarch, who would have imposed one Andrew Popham, a Papist, as a pensioner upon the foundation of that house. In 1680 he published his Telluris theoria sacra, so universally admired for the purity of the style and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of the sentiments, that King Charles gave encouragement to a translation of it into English. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> was, however, attacked by several writers. In 1692 he published his Archaeologia philosophica, dedicated to King William, to whom he was clerk of the cloister. He died in 1715. Since his death hath been published, his book De statu mortuorum et resurgentium, and his treatise De fide et officiis Christianorum.\n\nBurnet, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">Honourable</a> James, Lord Monboddo, a senator of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> in Scotland, was born about the year 1714. He was the son of Mr Burnet of Monboddo in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINCARDINESHIRE\">Kincardineshire</a>. After passing through the usual course of school education, he prosecuted his studies at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a>, with distinguished reputation. He was admitted an advocate in 1737, and on the 12th of February 1767, he was raised to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENCH\">bench</a> by the title of Lord Monboddo, in the room of Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a>, appointed a judge the 4th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1742, and who had succeeded Sir John Lauder of Fountainhall, admitted November 1, 1680; being the third on the bench in succession since the revolution.\n\nHe married Miss Farquharson, a very amiable woman, by whom he had a son and two daughters.\n\nHis private life was spent in the practice of all the social virtues, and in the enjoyment of much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> felicity. Although rigidly temperate in his habits of life, he, however, delighted much in the convivial society of his friends, and among these he could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> almost all the most eminent of those who were distinguished in Scotland for virtue, literature, or genuine elegance of conversation and manners. One of those who esteemed him the most was the late Lord Gardenstone, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> who possessed no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> portion of the same overflowing benignity of disposition, the same unimpeachable integrity as a judge, the same partial fondness for literature and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FINE_ARTS\">fine arts</a>. His son, a very promising boy, in whose education he took great delight, was, indeed, snatched away from his affections by a premature death. But, when it was too late for sorrow and anxiety to avail, the afflicted father stifled the emotions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, and wound up the energies of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> to the firmest tone of stoical fortitude. He was, in like manner, bereaved of his excellent lady, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his dearest tenderness; and he endured the loss with a similar firmness, fitted to do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>...\nhonour either to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> or to religion. In addition to his office as a judge in the court of session, an offer was made to him of a seat in the court of justiciary. But, though the emoluments of this would have made a convenient addition to his income, he refused to accept it; lest its business should too much detach him from the pursuit of his favourite studies. To these studies he continued through the whole of a long life to be greatly devoted. His admiration of the manners, literature, and philosophy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, was unbounded. Thus strongly prepossessed, it is not to be wondered at, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> which he made between the ancients and moderns, was little favourable to the latter. For among the former he supposed that he saw all that was elegant, manly, and virtuous, all that was praiseworthy and excellent; while the degenerate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of the moderns exhibited nothing but effeminacy and corruption.\n\nThe vacation of the court of session afforded him sufficient leisure to retire every year, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> and in autumn, to the country; and he used then to dress in a style of simplicity, as if he had been only a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a>; and to live among the people upon his estate, with all the kind familiarity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of an aged father among his grown-up children. Although his estate, from the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a>, afforded comparatively but a moderate income, he would never raise the rents, or displace an old tenant to make room for a new one who offered a higher rent. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the rural economy of some of the ancients, whom he chiefly admired, he accounted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> the true wealth of an estate, and was desirous of no improvement so much as of increasing the number of souls upon his lands, so as to make it greater, in proportion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, than that of those upon the estate of any neighbouring landholder. It was there he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of receiving Dr Samuel Johnson, with his friend James Boswell, at the time when these two gentlemen were upon their well-known tour through the Highlands of Scotland. Johnson admired nothing in literature so much as the display of a keen discrimination of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> character, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of the principles of moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, and that vigorous common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> which is the most happily applicable to the ordinary conduct of life. Monboddo delighted in the refinements, the subtleties, the abstractions, the affectations of literature; and, in comparison with these, despised the grossness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and of common affairs. Johnson thought learning and science to be little valuable, except so far as they could be made subservient to the purposes of living usefully and happily with the world, upon his own terms. Monboddo's favourite science taught him to look <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> with contempt upon all sublunary, and especially upon all modern things; and to fit life to literature and philosophy, not literature and philosophy to life. James Boswell, therefore, in carrying Johnson to visit Monboddo, probably thought of putting them one against another, as two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAME\">game</a> cocks, and promised himself much sport from the colloquial contest which he expected to ensue between them. But Monboddo was too hospitable and courteous to enter into keen contention with a stranger in his own house. There was much talk between them, but no angry controversy, no exasperation of that dislike for each other's well-known peculiarities with which they had met. Johnson, it is true, still continued to think Lord Monboddo what he called a prig in literature.\n\nLord Monboddo used frequently to visit London, to which he was allured by the opportunity that great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> affords of enjoying the conversation of a vast number of men of profound erudition. A journey to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> became a favourite amusement of his periods of vacation from the business of the court to which he belonged; and, for a time, he made this journey once a year. A carriage, a vehicle that was not in common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> among the ancients, he considered as an engine of effeminacy and sloth, which it was disgraceful for a man to make use of in travelling. To be dragged at the tail of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, instead of mounting upon his back, seemed, in his eyes, to be a truly ludicrous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a> of the genuine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of human nature. In all his journeys, therefore, between Edinburgh and London, he was wont to ride on horseback, with a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> attending him. He continued this practice, without finding it too fatiguing for his strength, till he was upwards of eighty years of age. Within these few years, on his return from a last visit, which he made on purpose to take leave, before his death, of all his old friends in London, he became exceedingly ill upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, and was unable to proceed; and had he not been overtaken by a Scotch friend, who prevailed upon him to travel the remainder of the way in a carriage, he might, perhaps, have actually perished by the way side, or breathed his last in some dirty inn. Since that time, he did not again attempt an equine journey to London.\n\nIn London, his visits were exceedingly acceptable to all his friends, whether of the literary or fashionable world. He delighted to shew himself at court; and the king is said to have taken a pleasure in conversing with the old man with a distinguishing notice that could not but be very flattering to him.\n\nA constitution of body, naturally framed to wear well and last long, was strengthened to Lord Monboddo by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, guarded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a>, and by a tenor of mind too firm to be deeply broken in upon by those passions which consume the principles of life. In the country he always used much the exercises of walking in the open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and of riding. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> bath was a means of preserving the health, to which he had recourse in all seasons, amid every severity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, under every inconvenience of indisposition or business, with a perseverance invincible. He was accustomed, alike in winter and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, to rise at a very early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, and, without loss of time, to betake himself to study or wholesome exercise. It is said, that he even found the use of what he called the air bath, or the practice of occasionally walking about, for some minutes, naked, in a room filled with fresh and cool air, to be highly salutary.\n\nLord Monboddo is well known to the world as a man of letters. His first publication was \"a Dissertation on the Origin and Progress of Language,\" in 2 vols. 8vo. 1773; which were followed by four more vols., the last published not long before his death. In this work, intended chiefly to vindicate the honours of Grecian literature, he attributes the origin of alphabetical writing to the Egyptians; and strenuously maintains, that the ouran-outang is a class of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, and that his want of speech is merely accidental. He al-\nBurnet, to endeavour to establish the reality of the existence of mermaids, and other fictitious animals. He was induced to undertake another work, for the purpose of defending the cause of Grecian philosophy; and published, in five vols. 4to. a work entitled, \"Antient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">Metaphysics</a>,\" which, like the other, is remarkable for a surprising mixture of erudition and genius, with the most absurd whims and conceits.\n\nAs a judge, his decisions were found, upright, and learned, and marked with acute discrimination; and free from those paradoxes and partialities which appear in his writings. He attended his judicial duty with indefatigable diligence till within a few days of his death, which happened at his house in Edinburgh, May 26, 1799, at the advanced age of 85.\n\nHis eldest daughter married some years before his death. His second daughter, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> loveliness one of the finest women of the age, was beheld in every public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> with general admiration, and was sought in marriage by many suitors. Her mind was endowed with all her father's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> of temper, and with all his taste for elegant literature, without any portion of his whims and caprices. It was her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> delight to be the nurse and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> of his declining age. Her presence contributed to draw around him, in his house, and at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, all that was truly respectable among the youth of his country. She mingled in the world of fashion, without sharing its follies; and heard those flatteries which are addressed to youth and beauty, without being betrayed to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and selfish vanity which is often the only sentiment that fills the heart of the highly-praised beauty. She delighted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a>, in literary conversation, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, and in the fine arts, without contracting from this taste, any of that pedantic self-conceit and affectation which usually characterize literary ladies, and whose pretence often frightens away the domestic virtues, the graces, the delicacies, and all the more interesting charms of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>. When Burns, the well-known Scottish poet, first arrived from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AYRSHIRE\">Ayrshire</a> to publish his poems in Edinburgh, there was none by whom he was more zealously patronized than by Lord Monboddo and his lovely daughter. No man's feelings were ever more powerfully or exquisitely alive than those of the rustic bard, to the emotions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>, or to the admiration of the good and fair. In a poem which he at that time wrote, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PANEGYRIC\">panegyric</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> to Edinburgh, he took occasion to celebrate the beauty and excellence of Miss Burnet, in perhaps the finest stanza of the whole:\n\n\"Thy daughters bright thy walks adorn,\n\"Gay as the gilded summer sky,\n\"Sweet as the dewy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THORN\">thorn</a>,\n\"Dear as the raptur'd thrill of joy!\n\"Fair Burnet strikes th' adoring eye;\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">Heaven</a>'s beauties on my fancy shine,\n\"I see the Sire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">Love</a> on high,\n\"And own his work, indeed, divine.\"\n\nShe was the ornament of the elegant society of the city in which she resided, her father's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a>, and the comfort of his domestic life in his declining years. Every amiable and noble sentiment was familiar to her heart, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> virtue was exemplified in her life. Yet, this woman, thus lovely, thus elegant, thus wife and virtuous, was cut off in the flower of her age, and left her father bereft of the last tender tie which bound <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNHAM\">Burnham</a>, him to society and to life. She died about six years before him of a consumption; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> that in Scotland proves too often fatal to the loveliest and most promising among the fair and the young. Neither his philosophy, nor the necessary torpor of the feelings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> old age, were capable of preventing Lord Monboddo from being very deeply affected by so grievous a loss; and from that time he began to droop exceedingly in his health and spirits.

She had retired in the evening to her chamber somewhat indisposed; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> was found in the middle of the room reduced to ashes, all except her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, legs, skull, and three fingers. The stockings and shoes she had on were not burnt in the least. The ashes were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>; and, on pressing between the fingers, vanished, leaving behind a grofs stinking moisture with which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> was smeared; the walls and furniture of the room being covered with a moify <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CINERITIOUS\">cineritious</a> foot, which had not only stained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> in the chests, but had penetrated into the closet, as well as into the room overhead, the walls of which were moistened with the same viscous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>.\u2014We have various other relations of persons burnt to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> in this unaccountable manner.\n\nSig. Mondini, Bianchini, und Maffei, have written treatises expressly to account for the cause of so extraordinary an event: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> fire it could not be, since this would likewise have burnt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> and the room; besides that it would have required many hours, and a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of fuel, to reduce a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> body to ashes; and, after all, a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> would have remained entire, as they were anciently found after the fiercest funeral fires. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> the effect to a mine of sulphur under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>; others, to a miracle; while others suspect that art or villany had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> in it. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERONA\">Verona</a> maintains, that such a conflagration might have arisen from the inflammable matters wherewith the human body naturally abounds. Sig. Bianchini accounts for the conflagration of the lady above-mentioned, from her using a bath or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOTION\">lotion</a> of camphorated spirit of wine when she found herself out of order. Maffei supposes it owing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>, but to lightning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> in her own body, agreeable to his doctrine, which is, That lightning does not proceed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>, but is always produced in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where it is seen and its effects perceived. We have\nhave had a late attempt to establish the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that these destroying internal fires are caused in the entrails of the body by inflamed effluvia of the blood; by juices and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a> in the stomach; by the many combustible matters which abound in living bodies for the purposes of life; and, finally, by the fiery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> which exhale from the fettlings of spirit of wine, brandies, and other hot liquors, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUNICA\">tunica</a> villosa of the stomach and other adipose or fat membranes; within which those spirits engender a kind of camphor, which in the night-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, by a full respiration, are put in a stronger motion, and are more apt to be set on fire. Others ascribe the cause of such persons being set on fire to lightning; and their burning so entirely, to the greater quantity of phosphorus and other combustible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> they contained.\u2014For our own part, we can by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means pretend to explain the cause of such a phenomenon: but for the interests of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> we wish it could be derived from something <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> to the human body; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a>, to the calamities of human life already known, we superadd a suspicion that we may unexpectedly, and without the least warning, be consumed by an internal fire, the thought is too dreadful to be borne.\n\nBurning, or Brenning, in our old customs, denotes an infectious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, got in the stews by conversing with lewd women, and supposed to be the same with what we now call the venereal disease.\n\nIn a manuscript of the vocation of John Bale to the bishopric of Ossory, written by himself, he speaks of Dr Hugh Wefton, who was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAN\">dean</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINDSOR\">Windsor</a> in 1556, but deprived by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Pole for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADULTERY\">adultery</a>, thus: \"At this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> is lecherous Wefton, who is more practised in the arts of breech-burning, than all the whores of the stews. He not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> ago burnt a beggar of St Botolph's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>.\" See Stews.\n\nBurning, in Antiquity, a way of disposing of the dead much practised by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, and still retained by several nations in the East and West Indies. The antiquity of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> rises as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as the Theban <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, where we are told of the great solemnity accompanying this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> at the pyre of Men\u00e6ceus and Archemorus, who were cotemporary with Jair the eighth judge of Israel. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a> abounds with funeral obsequies of this nature. In the inward regions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> the practice was of very ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a>, and the continuance long: for we are told, that, in the reign of Julian, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Chionia burnt his son's body, and deposited the ashes in a silver urn. Coeval almost with the first instances of this kind in the east, was the practice in the western parts of the world. The Herulians, the Getes, and the Thracians, had all along observed it; and its antiquity was as great with the Celts, Sarmatians, and other neighbouring nations. The origin of this custom seems to have been out of friendship to the deceased: their ashes were preserved as we preserve a lock of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a>, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>, which had been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of a deceased friend.\n\nKings were burnt in cloth made of the asbestos <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, that their ashes might be preserved pure from any mixture with the fuel and other matters thrown on the funeral pile. The same method is still observed with the princes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a>. Among the Greeks, the body was placed on the top of a pile, on which were thrown <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> animals, and even slaves and captives, besides unguents and perfumes. In the funeral of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATROCLUS\">Patroclus</a> we find a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of sheep and oxen thrown in, then four horses, followed by two dogs, and lastly by 12 Trojan prisoners. The like is mentioned by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a> in the funerals of his Trojans; where, besides oxen, swine, and all manner of cattle, we find eight youths condemned to the flames. The first thing was the fat of the beasts wherewith the body was covered, that it might consume the sooner: it being reckoned great felicity to be quickly reduced to ashes. For the like reason, where numbers were to be burnt at the same time, care was taken to mix with the rest some of humid constitutions, and therefore more easily to be inflamed. Thus we are assured by Plutarch and Macrobius, that for every ten men it was customary to put in one woman. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">Soldiers</a> usually had their arms burnt with them. The garments worn by the living were also thrown on the pile, with other ornaments and presents; a piece of extravagance which the Athenians carried to so great a height, that some of their lawgivers were forced to restrain them, by severe penalties, from defrauding the living by their liberality to the dead.\u2014In some cases, burning was expressly forbidden among the Romans, and even looked upon as the highest impiety. Thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a>, who died before the breeding of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, were interred unburnt in the ground, in a particular place set apart for this purpose, called sugrundarium. The like was practised with regard to those who had been struck dead with lightning, who were never to be burnt again. Some say that burning was denied to suicides.\u2014The manner of burning among the Romans was not unlike that of the Greeks; the corpse, being brought out without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, was carried directly to the place appointed for burning it; which, if it joined to the sepulchre, was called burying; if separate from it, burying; and there laid on the rogur or pyra, a pile of wood prepared on which to burn it, built in shape of an altar, but of different height according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the deceased. The wood used was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> from such trees as contain most pitch or rosin; and if any other were used, they split it for the more easy catching fire: round the pile they let cypress trees, probably to hinder the noisome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> of the corpse. The body was not placed on the bare pile, but on the couch or bed wherein it lay. This done, the next of blood performed the ceremony of lighting the pile; which they did with a torch, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> their faces all the while the other way, as if it were done with reluctance. During the ceremony, decursions and games were celebrated; after which came the offegium, or gathering of the bones and ashes; also washing and anointing them, and repotting them in urns.\n\nBurning, among surgeons, denotes the application of an actual cautery, that is, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>-hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, to the part affected: otherwise denominated cauterization. The whole art of physic among the Japanese lies in the choice of places proper to be burnt: which are varied according to the disease. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> of the Mogul, the colic is cured by an iron ring applied red-hot about the patient's navel. Certain it is, that some very extraordinary cures have been performed accidentally by burning. The following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is recorded in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the academy of sciences by M. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMBERG\">Homberg</a>. A woman of about 35 became subject to a head-\nBurning, which at times was so violent that it drove her out of her senses, making her sometimes stupid and foolish, at other times raving and furious. The seat of the pain was in the forehead, and over the eyes, which were inflamed, and looked violently red and sparkling; and the most violent fits of it were attended with nausea and vomiting. In the times of the fits, she could take no food; but out of them, had a very good stomach. Mr Homberg had in vain attempted her cure for three years with all kinds of medicines: only opium succeeded; and that but little, all its effect being only the taking off the pain for a few hours. The redness of her eyes was always the sign of an approaching fit. One night, feeling a fit coming on, she went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> upon the bed; but first walked up to the glass with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> in her hand, to see how her eyes looked: in observing this, the candle fell fire to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>: and as she was alone, her head was terribly burnt before the fire could be extinguished. Mr Homberg was sent for, and ordered bleeding and proper dressings: but it was perceived, that the expected fit this night never came on; the pain of the burning wore off by degrees; and the patient found herself from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> cured of the headache, which had never returned in four years after, which was the time when the account was communicated. Another case, not less remarkable than the former, was communicated to Mr Homberg by a physician at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUGES\">Bruges</a>. A woman, who for several years had her legs and thighs swelled in an extraordinary manner, found some relief from rubbing them before the fire with brandy every morning and evening. One evening the fire chanced to catch the brandy she had rubbed herself with, and slightly burnt her. She applied some brandy to her burn; and in the night all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> her legs and thighs were swelled with was entirely discharged by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>, and the swelling did not again return.\n\n**Burning-Bush.** See **Bush.**\n\n**Burning Glass,** a convex glass commonly spherical, which being exposed directly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, collects all the rays falling thereon into a very small space called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a>; where wood or any other combustible matter being put, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be set on fire. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> burning-glass is also used to denote those concave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRRORS\">mirrors</a>, whether composed of glass quicksilvered, or of metallic matters, which burn by reflection, condensing the sun's rays into a focus similar to the former.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-BURNING_GLASSES\">burning-glasses</a> appears to have been very ancient. Diodorus Siculus, Lucian, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DION\">Dion</a>, Zonaras, Galen, Anthemius, Euclidius, Tzetzes, and others, attest, that by means of them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a> set fire to the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> at the siege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a>. Tzetzes is so particular in his account of this matter, that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> suggested to Kircher the method by which it was probably accomplished. That author says, that \"Archimedes set fire to Marcellus's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>, by means of a burning glass composed of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> mirrors moving every way upon hinges; which, when placed in the sun's rays, directed them upon the Roman fleet, so as to reduce it to ashes at the distance of a bow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a>.\"\n\nA very particular testimony we have also from Anthemius of Lydia, who takes pains to prove the possibility of setting fire to a fleet, or any other combustible body, at such a distance.\n\nThat the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> were also acquainted with the use of catoptric or refracting burning-glasses, appears from a passage in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOPHANES\">Aristophanes</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMEDY\">comedy</a> of The Clouds, which clearly treats of their effects. The author introduces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a> as examining Strephades about the method he had discovered of getting clear of his debts. He replies, that \"he thought of making use of a burning-glass which he had hitherto used in kindling his fire;\" \"for (says he) should they bring a writ against me, I'll immediately place my glass in the sun at some little distance from it, and set it on fire.\" Pliny and Lactantius have also spoken of glasses that burn by refraction. The former calls them balls or globes of glass or crystal, which, exposed to the sun, transmit a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> sufficient to set fire to cloth, or corrode the dead <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> of those patients who stand in need of caustics; and the latter, after Clemens Alexandrinus, takes notice that fire may be kindled by interposing glasses filled with water between the sun and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, so as to transmit the rays to it.\n\nIt seems difficult to conceive how they should know such glasses would burn without knowing they would magnify, which it is granted they did not, till towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the 13th century, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECTACLES\">spectacles</a> were first thought on. For as to those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> in Plautus which seem to intimate the knowledge of spectacles, M. de la Hire observes, they do not prove any such thing; and he solves this, by observing, that their burning-glasses being spheres, either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> or full of water, their foci would be one-fourth of their diameter distant from them. If then their diameter were supposed half a foot, which is the most we can allow, an object must be at an inch and a half distance to perceive it magnified; those at greater distances do not appear greater, but only more confused through the glass than out of it. It is no wonder, therefore, the magnifying property of convex glasses was unknown, and the burning one known. It is more wonderful there should be 300 years between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of spectacles and telescopes.\n\nAmong the ancients, the burning mirrors of Archimedes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCLUS\">Proclus</a> are famous: the former we have already taken notice of; by the other, the navy of Vitellius besieging Byzantium, according to Zonaras, was burnt to ashes.\n\nAmong the moderns, the most remarkable burning mirrors are those of Settala, of Villette, of Tschirnhausen, of Buffon, of Trudaine, and of Parker.\n\nSettala, canon of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PADUA\">Padua</a>, made a parabolic mirror, which, according to Schottus, burnt pieces of wood at the distance of 15 or 16 paces. The following things are noted of it in the *Acta Eruditorum.* 1. Green wood takes fire instantaneously, so as a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> cannot extinguish it. 2. Water boils immediately; and eggs in it are presently edible. 3. A mixture of tin and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, three inches thick, drops presently; and iron and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> plate becomes red-hot presently, and a little after burns into holes. 4. Things not capable of melting, as flones, bricks, &c., become soon red-hot, like iron. 5. Slate becomes first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, then a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> glass. 6. Tiles are converted into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> glass, and shells into a blackish yellow one. 7. A pumice stone, emitted from a volcano, melts into white glass; and, 8. A piece of crucible also vitrifies in eight minutes. 9. Bones are soon turned into an opaque glass, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> into a black one. The breadth of this mirror is near three Leipic cells; its focus two cells from it; it is made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, and\nBurning, and its substance is not above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> the thickness of the back of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>.\n\nVillette, a French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> of Lyons, made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> mirror, which was bought by Tavernier and presented to the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, bought by the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>; a third, presented by the French king to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Academy; a fourth has been in England, where it was publicly exposed. The effects hereof, as found by Dr Harris and Dr Desguliers, are, that a silver sixpence is melted in 7\u00bd\", a King George's halfpenny in 16\", and runs with a hole in 34\". Tin melts in 3\", <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> iron in 16\", slate in 3\u00bd\"; a fossil shell calcines in 7\"; a piece of Pompey's pillar at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a> vitrifies, the black part in 50\", in the white in 54\"; copper ore in 8\"; bone calcines in 4\"; vitrifies in 33\u00be\". An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMERALD\">emerald</a> melts into a substance like a turquoise stone; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a> weighing four grains loses \u00bd of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>: the asbestos vitrifies; as all other bodies will do; if kept long enough in the focus; but when once vitrified, the mirror can go no farther with them. This mirror is 47 inches wide, and is ground to a sphere of 76 inches radius; so that its focus is about 38 inches from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a>. Its substance is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of tin, copper, and tin-glass.\n\nEvery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENS\">lens</a>, whether convex, plano-convex, or convexo-convex, collects the sun's rays, dispersed over its convexity, into a point by refraction; and is therefore a burning glass. The most considerable of this kind is that made by M. de Tschirnhausen; the diameters of his lenses are three and four feet, the focus at the distance of 12 feet, and its diameter an inch and a half. To make the focus the more vivid, it is collected a second time by a second lens <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the first, and placed in that point where the diameter of the cone of rays formed by the first lens is equal to the diameter of the second; so that it receives them all; and the focus, from an inch and a half, is contracted into the space of eight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, and its force increased proportionally.\n\nThis glass vitrifies tiles, flates, pumice-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, &c., in a moment. It melts sulphur, pitch, and all resins, under water; the ashes of vegetables, woods, and other matters, are transmuted into glass; and every thing applied to its focus is either melted, turned into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALX\">calx</a>, or into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>. Tschirnhausen observes, that it succeeds best when the matter applied is laid on a hard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> well burnt.\n\nSir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton presented a burning-glass to the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, consisting of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> concave glasses, so placed as that all their foci join in one physical point. Each glass is about 11 inches and a half in diameter: six of them are placed round the seventh, to which they are all contiguous; and they form a kind of segment of a sphere, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUBTENSE\">subtense</a> is about 34 inches and a half, and the central glass lies about an inch farther in than the rest. The common focus is about 22 inches and a half distant, and about an inch in diameter. This glass vitrifies brick or tile in 1\", and melts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> in 30\".\n\nIt would appear, however, that glass quicksilvered is a more proper material for burning glasses than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>; for the effects of that specimen wherewith Mr Macquer melted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLATINA\">platina</a> seem to have been superior to those above mentioned, though the mirror itself was much smaller. The diameter of this glass was only 22 inches, and its focal distance 28. Black flint, when exposed to the focus, being powdered to prevent its crackling and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> about, and secured in a large piece of charcoal, bubbled up and ran into transparent glass in less than half a minute. Hessian crucibles, and glass-house pots, vitrified completely in three or four seconds. Forged iron smoked, boiled, and changed into a vitreous scoria as soon as it was exposed to the focus. The gypsum of Montmartre, when the flat sides of the plates or leaves of which it is composed were presented to the glass, did not show the least disposition to melt; but, on presenting a transverse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of it, or the edges of the plates, it melted in an instant, with a hissing noise, into a brownish yellow matter. Calcareous stones did not completely melt; but there was detached from them a circle more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> than the rest of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, and of the size of the focus; the separation of which seemed to be occasioned by the shrinking of the matter which had begun to enter into fusion. The white calx of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a>, commonly called diaphoretic antimony, melted better than the calcareous stones, and changed into an opaque pretty glossy substance like white enamel. It was observed, that the whitening of the calcareous stones and the antimonial calx was of great disadvantage to their fusion, by reason of their reflecting great part of the sun's rays; so that the subject could not undergo the full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> of the heat thrown upon it by the burning-glass. The case was the same with metallic bodies; which melted too much the more difficulty as they were more white and polished; and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> was so remarkable, that in the focus of this mirror, so fusible a metal as silver, when its surface was polished, did not melt at all.\n\nPlate CXXXI. fig. 1. represents M. Buffon's burning mirror, which he with great reason supposes to be of the same nature with that of Archimedes. It consists of a number of small mirrors of glass quicksilvered, all of which are held together by an iron frame. Each of these small mirrors is also moveable by a contrivance on the back part of the frame, so that their reflections may all coincide in one point. By this means they are capable of being accommodated to various heights of the sun, and to different distances. The adjusting them in this manner takes up a considerable time; but after they are so adjusted, the focus will continue unaltered for an hour or more.\n\nFig. 2. represents a contrivance of M. Buffon's for diminishing the thickness of very large refracting lenses. He observes, that in the large lenses of this kind, and which are most convenient for many purposes, the thickness of the glass in the middle is so great as very much to diminish their force. For this reason he proposes to form a burning-glass of concentric circular pieces of glass, each resting upon the other, as represented in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. His method is to divide the convex <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of the lens into three equal parts. Thus, suppose the diameter to be 26 inches, and the thickness in the middle to be three inches: By dividing the lens into three concentric circles, and laying the one over the other, the thickness of the middle piece needs be only one inch; at the same time that the lens will have the same convexity, and almost the same focal distance, as\nM. Trudaine, a French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, constructed a burning lens on a new principle. It was composed of two circular segments of glass spears, each four feet in diameter, applied with their concave sides towards each other. The cavity was filled with spirit of wine, of which it contained 42 pints. It was presented by the maker to the royal academy of sciences, but was not long after broken by accident. The expense of constructing it amounted to about 1000l. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>. After all, it does not appear that the effects of this lens were very great. Mr Magellan informs us, that it could only coagulate the particles of platinum in 20 minutes, while Mr Parker's lens entirely melted them in less than two.\n\nA large burning lens, indeed, for the purpose of fusing and vitrifying such substances as resist the fires of ordinary furnaces, and especially for the application of heat in vacuo, and in other circumstances in which heat cannot be applied by any other means, has long been a desideratum among persons concerned in philosophical experiments: And it appears now to be in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> accomplished by Mr Parker. His lens is three feet in diameter, made of flint-glass, and which, when fixed in its frame, exposes a surface two feet eight inches and a half in the clear.\n\nIn the Elevation represented on Plate CXXXII, A is the lens of the diameter mentioned: thickness in the centre, three inches and one-fourth: weight, 212 pounds: length of the focus, six feet eight inches; diameter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DITTO\">ditto</a>, one inch. B, a second lens, whose diameter in the frame is 16 inches, and shows in the clear 13 inches: thickness in the centre, one inch five-eighths: weight 21 pounds: length of focus 29 inches: diameter of ditto, three-eighths of an inch. When the two above lenses are compounded together, the length of the focus is five feet three inches: diameter of ditto, half an inch. C, a truncated cone, composed of 21 ribs of wood: at the larger end is fixed the great lens A; at the smaller extremity the lesser lens B: near the smaller end is also fixed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a>, D, passing through the pillar L, moveable by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PINION\">pinion</a> turning in the laid pillar, by means of the handle E, and thus giving a vertical motion to the machine. F, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> of wood, fixed between the two lower ribs of the cone at G; having, within a chafed mortice in which it moves, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> H, with the iron plate, I, fixed thereto; and this part turning on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> and socket, K, a method is thereby obtained of placing the matter under experiment, so as to be acted upon by the focal rays in the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> and powerful manner. LL, a strong mahogany frame, moving on castors, MM. Immediately under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> N are three friction <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a>, by which the machine moves horizontally.

Of these there are many in different parts of the world; particularly one in Dauphiny near Grenoble; another near Hermannstadt in Transylvania; a third at Chermay, a village near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>; a fourth in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTON\">canton</a> of Friburg; and a fifth not far from the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CRACOW\">Cracow</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a>. There also is, or was, a famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> of the same kind at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WIGAN\">Wigan</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANCASHIRE\">Lancashire</a>, which, upon the approach of a lighted candle, would take fire and burn like spirit of wine for a whole day. But the most remarkable one of this kind, or at least that of which we have the most particular description, was discovered in 1711 at Brofely in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHROPSHIRE\">Shropshire</a>. The following account of this remarkable spring was given by the reverend Mr Mason, Woodwardian professor at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, dated February 18, 1746. \"The well for four or five feet deep is fix or seven feet wide; within that is another hole of like depth dug in the clay, in the bottom whereof is placed a cylindric earthen vessel, of about four or five inches diameter at the mouth, having the bottom taken off, and the sides well fixed in the clay rammed...\"\nBurning, rammed close about it. Within the pot is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> Burnisher, water, thick as puddle, continually forced up with a violent motion beyond that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water, and a rumbling hollow noise, rising or falling by fits five or six inches; but there was no appearance of any vapour rising, which perhaps might have been visible, had not the sun shone so bright. Upon putting a candle down at the end of a stick, at about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of a yard distance, it took fire, darting and flashing after a very violent manner for about half a yard high, much in the manner of spirits in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>, but with great agitation. It was said, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>-kettle had been made to boil in about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> minutes time, and that it had been left burning for 48 hours without any sensible diminution. It was extinguished by putting a wet mop upon it; which must be kept there for a little time, otherwise it would not go out. Upon the removal of the mop there arises a sulphurous smoke lasting about a minute, and yet the water is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> to the touch.\" In 1755, this well totally disappeared by the sinking of a coal-pit in its neighbourhood.\n\nThe cause of the inflammable property of such waters is, with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, supposed to be their mixture with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETROLEUM\">petroleum</a>, which is a very inflammable substance, and has the property of burning on the surface of water.\n\n**Burning of Colours**, among painters. There are several colours that require burning; as,\n\nFirst, Lamp-black, which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of so greasy a nature, that, except it is burnt, it will require a long time to dry. The method of burning, or rather drying, lamp-black, is as follows: Put it into a crucible over a clear fire, letting it remain till it be red hot, or so near it that no manner of smoke arises from it.\n\nSecondly, Umber, which if it be intended for colour for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, or to be a shadow for gold, then burning fits it for both these purposes. In order to burn umber, you must put it into the naked fire, in large lumps, and not take it out till it is thoroughly red hot; if you have a mind to be more curious, put it into a crucible, and keep it over the fire till it be red hot.\n\nIvory also must be burnt to make black, thus: Fill two crucibles with shavings of ivory, then clap their two mouths together, and bind them fast with an iron-wire, and lute the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> close with clay, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, and horse-dung, well beaten together; then set it over the fire, covering it all over with coals: let it remain in the fire till you are sure that the matter enclosed is thoroughly red hot: then take it out of the fire; but do not open the crucibles till they are perfectly cold; for were they opened while hot, the matter would turn to ashes; and so it will be, if the joints are not luted close.\n\n**Burnisher**, a round polished piece of steel serving to smooth and give a lustre to metals.\n\nOf these there are different kinds of different figures, straight, crooked, &c. Half burnishers are used to folder silver, as well as to give a lustre.\n\nBurnishers for gold and silver are commonly made of a dog's or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLF\">wolf</a>'s tooth, set in the end of an iron or wooden handle. Of late, agates and pebbles have been introduced, which many prefer to the dog's tooth.\n\nThe burnishers used by engravers in copper, usually serve with one end to burnish, and with the other to scrape.\n\n**Burnishing**, the art of smoothing or polishing a metallic body, by a brisk rubbing of it with a burnisher.\n\nBook-binders burnish the edges of their books, by rubbing them with a dog's tooth.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BURNLEY\">Burnley</a>**, a town of Lancashire in England, situated in W. Long. 2\u00b0 5'. N. Lat. 51\u00b0 3'.\n\n**Burns, Robert**, was a native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AYRSHIRE\">Ayrshire</a>, one of the western counties of Scotland. He was the son of humble parents; and his father passed through life in the condition of a hired labourer, or of a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a>. Even in this situation, however, it was not hard for him to send his children to the parish school, to receive the ordinary instruction in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a>, and the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. By this course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> young Robert profited to a degree that might have encouraged his friends to destine him to one of the liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a>, had not his father's poverty made it necessary to remove him from school, as soon as he had grown up, to earn for himself the means of support as a hired ploughboy or shepherd.\n\nThe expense of education in the parish-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> of Scotland is so small, that hardly any parents who are able to labour want the means of giving to their children at least such education as young Burns received. From the spring labours of a ploughboy, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> employment of a shepherd, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a>-youth often returns for a few months, eagerly to pursue his education at the parish-school.\n\nIt was so with Burns; he returned from labour to learning, and from learning went again to labour, till his mind began to open to the charms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and knowledge; till he began to feel a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for books, and for the subjects of books, which was to give a colour to the whole thread of his future life. On nature, he soon began to gaze with new discernment and with new enthusiasm: his mind's eye opened to perceive affecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and sublimity, where, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> grots, peasant, there was sought to be seen but water, earth, and sky\u2014but animals, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, and foil.\n\nWhat might perhaps first contribute to dispose his mind to poetical efforts, is one particular in the devotional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> of the Scotch peasantry. It is still common for them to make their children get by heart the Psalms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>, in the version of homely rhymes which is used in their churches. In the morning and in the evening of every day, or at least on the evening of every Saturday and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a>, these Psalms are sung in solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a> is read, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a> is fervently uttered. The whole books of the sacred Scriptures are thus continually in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of almost every peasant. And it is impossible that there should not be occasionally some souls among them, awakened to the divine emotions of genius by that rich assemblage which those books present, of almost all that is interesting in incidents, or picturesque in imagery, or affectingly sublime or tender in sentiments and character. It is impossible that those rude rhymes, and the simple artless music with which they are accompanied, should not occasionally excite some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> to a fond perception of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELODY\">melody</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>. That Burns had felt these impulses, will appear undeniably certain to whoever shall carefully peruse his Cor-\ntar's Saturday's Night; or shall remark, with nice observation, the various fragments of Scripture sentiment, of Scripture imagery, of Scripture <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, which are scattered throughout his works.\n\nStill more interesting to the young peasantry are those ancient ballads of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> and war, of which a great number are, in the south of Scotland, yet popularly known, and often sung by the rustic maid or matron at her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINNING\">spinning</a>-wheel. They are listened to with ravished ears by old and young. Their rude melody; that mingled curiosity and awe which are naturally excited by the very idea of their antiquity; the exquisitely tender and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> complaints sometimes poured forth in them; the gallant deeds of knightly heroism, which they sometimes celebrate; their wild tales of demons, ghosts, and fairies, in whose existence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> alone has believed; the manners which they represent; the obsolete, yet picturesque and expressive, language in which they are often clothed\u2014give them wonderful power to transport every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, and to agitate every heart. To the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> of Burns they were like a happy breeze touching the wires of an \u00c6olian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARP\">harp</a>, and calling forth the most ravishing melody.\n\nBeside all this, the Gentle Shepherd, and the other poems of Allan Ramsay, have long been highly popular in Scotland. They fell early into the hands of Burns; and while the fond applause which they received drew his emulation, they presented to him likewise treasures of phraseology and models of versification. He got acquainted at the same time with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> of Robert Fergusson, written chiefly in the Scottish dialect, and exhibiting many specimens of uncommon poetical excellence. The Seasons of Thomson too, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">Grave</a> of Blair, the far-famed Elegy of Gray, the Paradise Loft of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a>, perhaps the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINSTREL\">Minstrel</a> of Beattie, were so commonly read, even among those with whom Burns would naturally associate, that poetical curiosity, although even less ardent than his, could in such circumstances have little difficulty in procuring them.","sp":14,"ep":24},{"h":"BURNTWOOD","t":"a town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSEX\">Essex</a> in England, situated on a hill, in E. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">Long</a>. o. 25.

The trundle-head B turns a spur-wheel D of 10 cogs, and two feet eight inches in diameter. This spur-wheel has two cranks, a b, in its shaft; one of which a gives <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> to a wooden frame, c, about 34 inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and 19 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>. On the under side of this frame are fastened by screws 12 pieces of polished metal, each five inches and a half long, and three broad, covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>; and underneath these polishers a glass-plate cemented in another frame is placed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENCH\">bench</a> d, and polished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIPOLI\">tripoli</a> by the motion given to the upper frame by the crank a. The nuts of the screws which fasten the polishers to the upper frame are not screwed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the wood, in order to give the frame room to play; by which contrivance the perpendicular rise of the crank is avoided, and the motion of the polishers is always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> and equal. The under frame may be moved by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> without stopping the machine; by which means the plate, when larger than the polishing frame can cover in its motion, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be equally polished in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>.\n\nThe other crank b gives motion to two other polishers marked n, o, which have an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> motion by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> of the crank; they move upon the same plate, and have an equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of polishers as that already described.\n\nThe same crank also gives motion to a contrivance represented at e for polishing spectacle-glasses. It consists of two segments of the same sphere; one concave and the other convex. On the latter the glasses are cemented; and polished by the former, which is moved by the crank b. The convex segment may be moved round by the hand without stopping the machine, so that all the glasses on its superficies will be equally polished.\n\nThe other spur-wheel C, by means of a crank in its shaft, gives motion to another frame g, employed in grinding the glass plates. The rod h, extended from the crank f to the frame g, is fastened to the latter by means of a pivot, in order to admit of a rotatory motion, as well as that given it by the crank in a longitudinal direction. This rotatory motion is effected by means of a rod of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> i, called a trigger; sharp at the extremity next the frame, where it touches the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> of an horizontal spur-wheel, or circular piece of wood, fixed on the grinding plate, while the other end is extended three feet two inches to the centre of motion.\n\nBut this contrivance, in which the merit of the machine principally consists, will be much better conceived from a small delineation of it by itself (fig. 4.), where F is the crank marked f in fig. 3., and turned by the spur-wheel C in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. G is the trigger, three feet two inches long. I, a roll fixed on the trigger for the rod to slide on. H, the horizontal spur-wheel, eleven inches in diameter, fixed on the grinding plate; the teeth of which are touched by the trigger; but with a very unequal force, as it will wholly depend upon the grinding-plate's being farther from, or nearer to, the centre of motion of the trigger. By this simple contrivance, the grinding-plate has a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> motion, never moving exactly in the same track, and therefore must grind the plates equally in every part. Several attempts have been made by others for producing the same effect; but without success; the grinding-plate always follows the same track, and consequently the plates are ground equally.\n\nBurrow, Sir James, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> office, was elected F.

The nomination to burfes is in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the patrons and founders thereof.

In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, burse amounts to the same with what we otherwise call an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a>.\n\nThe first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of this kind to which the name Burse was given, Guiccardin affirms was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUGES\">Bruges</a>; and it took its denomination from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOTEL\">hotel</a> adjoining to it, built by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> de la Bourie, whose arms, which are three purfes, are still found on the crowning over the portal of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>. Catel's account is somewhat different, viz. that the merchants of Bruges bought a house <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> apartment to meet in, at which was the sign of the purfes. From this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> the name was afterwards transferred to the like places in others, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTWERP\">Antwerp</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERGEN\">Bergen</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>.

Some middle-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> writers seem to make burying alive (defollio) the punishment of a woman thief. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a> gives instances of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESURRECTION\">resurrection</a> of persons who have been buried alive. The famous Duns Scotus is of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>; who, having been seized with a catalepsy, was thought dead, and laid to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> among his fathers, but raised again by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> in whose absence he had been buried. Bartholin gives an account of a woman, who, on recovering from an apoplexy, could not be convinced but that she was dead, and solicited so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and so earnestly to be buried, that they were forced to comply; and performed the ceremonies, at least in appearance. The famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. after his abdication, took it into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> to have his burial celebrated in his lifetime, and affixed at it. See CHARLES V.\n\nBURYING-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">PLACE</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> buried out of cities and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>; an usage which we find equally among Jews, Greeks, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>. Among the last, burying within the walls was expressly prohibited by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of the 12 tables. The usual places of interment were in the suburbs and fields, but especially by the waysides. We have instances, however, of persons buried in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>; but it was a favour allowed only to a few of singular merit in the commonwealth. Plutarch says, those who had triumphed were indulged in it. Be this as it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, Val. Publicola, and C. Fabricius, are said to have had tombs in the forum; and Cicero adds Tubertus to the number. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LYCURGUS\">Lycurgus</a> allowed his Lacedemonians to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> their dead within the city and around their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>, that the youth, being inured to such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECTACLES\">spectacles</a>, might be the less terrified with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. Two reasons are alleged why the ancients buried out of cities: the first, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that the sight, touch, or even neighbourhood, of a corpse defiled a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, especially a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>; whence that rule in A. Gellius, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAMEN\">flamen</a> Dialis might not on any account enter a place where there was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, to prevent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> from being corrupted by the stench of putrefied bodies, and the buildings from being endangered by the frequency of funeral fires.\n\nBurying in churches was not allowed for the first 300 years after Christ; and the same was severely prohibited by the Christian emperors for many ages afterwards. The first step towards it appears to have been the practice of erecting churches over the graves of some martyrs in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and translating the relics of others into churches in the city; the next was, allowing kings and emperors to be buried in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATRIUM\">atrium</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>-porch. In the 6th century, the people began to be admitted into the church-yards; and some princes, founders, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, into the church.

He died in 1680; and though he met with many disappointments, was never reduced to anything like want, nor did he die in debt. Mr Granger observes, that Butler \"stands without rival in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURLESQUE\">burlesque</a> poetry. His Hudibras (says he) is in its kind, almost as great an effort of genius, as the Paradise Lost itself.

His father, who was a Presbyterian, observing that he had a strong inclination to learning, after his being at a grammar-school, sent him to an academy in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLOUCESTERSHIRE\">Gloucestershire</a>, in order to qualify him for a dissenting minister; and while there, he wrote some remarks on Dr Clarke's first sermon at Boyle's lecture. Afterwards, resolving to conform to the established <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, he studied at Oriel college, where he contracted an intimate friendship with Mr Edward Talbot, son of the bishop of Durham, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> to the lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a>, who laid the foundation of his subsequent advancement. He was first appointed preacher at the Rolls, and rector of Haughton and Stanhope, two rich benefices in the bishopric of Durham. He quitted the Rolls in 1726; and published in 8vo, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of sermons, preached at that chapel. After this he constantly resided at Stanhope, in the regular discharge of all the duties of his office, till the year 1733, when he was called to attend the lord chancellor Talbot as his chaplain, who gave him a prebend in the church of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROCHESTER\">Rochester</a>. In the year 1736, he was appointed clerk of the closet to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> Caroline, whom he attended every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, by her majesty's special command, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> in the evening.

He now resigned his living of Stanhope. In the year 1746, he was made clerk of the closet to the king; and in 1752, was translated to Durham. This rich preferment he enjoyed but a short time; for he died at Bath <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 16, 1752.

The former, he thinks, derived their knowledge of butter from the Scythians, the Thracians and Phrygians; and the latter from the people of Germany.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> burnt butter in their lamps instead of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>; and in the Roman churches, it was anciently allowed, during Christmas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, to burn butter instead of oil, on account of the great consumption of it otherwise.\n\nButter is the fat, oily, and inflammable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the milk. This kind of oil is naturally distributed through all the substance of the milk in very small particles, which are interposed between the calcareous and ferrous parts, amongst which it is suspended by a slight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADHESION\">adhesion</a>, but without being dissolved. It is in the same state in which oil is in emulsions: hence the same whitening of milk and emulsions; and hence, by rest, the oily parts separate from both these liquors to the surface, and form a cream. See Emulsion.\n\nWhen butter is in the state of cream, its proper oily parts are not yet sufficiently united together to form a homogeneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>. They are still half separated by the interposition of a pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of ferrous and calcareous particles. The butter is completely formed by pressing out these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a> parts by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> percussion. It then becomes an uniform soft mass.\n\nFresh butter which has undergone no change, has scarce any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>; its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> is mild and agreeable; it melts with a weak <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, and none of its principles are disengaged by the heat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. These properties prove, that the oily part of butter is of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the fat, fixed, and mild oils obtained from many vegetable substances by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>. See Oils.\u2014The half fluid consistence of butter, as of most other concrete oily matters, is thought to be owing to a considerable quantity of acid united with the oily part; which acid is so well combined, that it is not perceptible while the butter is fresh and has undergone no change; but when it grows old, and undergoes some kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a>, then the acid is disengaged more and more; and this is the cause that butter, like oils of the same kind, becomes rancid by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>.\n\nButter is constantly used in food, from its agreeable taste; but to be wholesome, it must be very fresh and free from rancidity, and also not fried or burnt; otherwise its acrid and even caustic acid, being disengaged, disorders digestion, renders it difficult and painful, excites acid empyreumatic belchings, and introduces much acrimony into the blood. Some persons have stomachs so delicate, that they are even affected with these inconveniences by fresh butter and milk. This observation is also applicable to oil, fat, chocolate, and in general to all oleaginous matters.\n\nFor the making of butter see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>.\n\nThe trade in butter is very considerable. Some compute 50,000 tons annually consumed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. It is chiefly made within 40 miles round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>. Fifty thousand firkins are said to be sent yearly from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUFFOLK\">Suffolk</a> alone: each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIRKIN\">firkin</a> containing 56lbs. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UTTOXETER\">Uttoxeter</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFFORDSHIRE\">Staffordshire</a> is a market famous for good butter, insomuch that the London <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> have established a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTORY\">factory</a> there for that article.

Common buttons are generally made of mohair; some indeed are made of silk, and others of thread; but the latter are of a very inferior sort. In order to make a button, the mohair must be previously wound on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOBBIN\">bobbin</a>; and the mould fixed to a board by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BODKIN\">bodkin</a> thrust through the hole in the middle of it. This being done, the workman wraps the mohair round the mould in three, four, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> five columns, according to the button.\n\nHorse-hair Buttons. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a> of these buttons are covered with a kind of stuff composed of silk and hair; the warp being belladine silk, and the shott horse hair. This stuff is wove with two selvages, in the same manner and in the same loom as ribbands. It is then cut into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> pieces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the size of the button, wrapped round the moulds, and the selvages stitched together, which form the under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the button.\n\nCleaning of Buttons. A button is not finished when it comes from the maker's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>; the superfluous hair and hubs of silk must be taken off, and the button rendered glossy and beautiful before it can be sold. This is done in the following manner: A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of buttons are put into a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> sieve, called by workmen a fingeing box. Then a little spirit of wine being poured into a kind of shallow iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISH\">dish</a>, and set on fire, the workman moves and shakes the fingeing box, containing the buttons, briskly over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> of the spirit, by which the superfluous hairs, hubs of silk, &c. are burnt off, without damaging the buttons. Great care, however, must be taken that the buttons in the fingeing box be kept continually in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they are suffered to rest over the flame, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> immediately burn. When all these loose hairs, &c. are burnt off by the flame of the spirit, the buttons are taken out of the fingeing box, and put, with a proper quantity of the crumbs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> bag, about three feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, and of a conical shape; the mouth or smaller end of which being tied up, the workman takes one of the ends in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> and the other in the other, and shakes the hand briskly with a particular jerk. This operation cleanses the buttons, renders them very glossy, and fit for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">Gold</a>-twist Buttons. The mould of these buttons is first covered in the same manner with that of common buttons. This being done, the whole is covered with a thin plate of gold or silver, and then wrought over of different forms, with purple and gimp. The former is a kind of thread composed of silk and gold wire twisted together; and the latter, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> tubes of gold or silver, about the tenth of an inch long. These are joined together by means of a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a>, filled with silk, thrust through their apertures, in the same manner as beads or bugles.\n\nThe manner of making Metal Buttons. The metal with which the moulds are intended to be covered is first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> into small ingots, and then flattened into thin plates or leaves, of the thickness intended, at the flattening <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a>; after which it is cut into small round pieces proportionable to the size of the mould they are intended to cover, by means of proper punches on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> of wood covered with a thick plate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>. Each piece of metal thus cut out of the plate is reduced into the form of a button, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> it successively in several cavities, or concave moulds, of a spherical form, with a convex punchon of iron, always beginning with the shallowest cavity of the mould, and proceeding to the deeper, till the plate has acquired the intended form: and the better to manage to thin a plate, they form ten, twelve, and sometimes even twenty-four, to the cavities, or concave moulds, at once; often nealing the metal during the operation, to make it more ductile. This plate is generally called by workmen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a> of the button.\n\nThe form being thus given to the plates or caps, they\nthey strike the intended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on the convex side by means of a similar iron punchen, in a kind of mould engraven en creux, either by the hammer or the press used in coining. The cavity or mould, wherein the impression is to be made, is of a diameter and depth suitable to the sort of button intended to be struck in it; each kind requiring a particular mould. Between the punchen and the plate is placed a thin piece of lead, called by workmen a bob, which greatly contributes to the taking off all the strokes of the engraving; the lead, by reason of its softness, easily giving way to the parts that have relievo, and as easily infusing itself into the traces or indentures.\n\nThe plate thus prepared makes the cap or shell of the button. The lower part is formed of another plate, in the same manner, but much flatter, and without any impression. To the last or under plate is soldered a small eye made of wire, by which the button is to be fastened.\n\nThe two plates being thus finished, they are soldered together with soft folder, and then turned in a lathe. Generally indeed they use a wooden mould, instead of the under plate; and in order to fasten it, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> a thread or gut across, through the middle of the mould, and fill the cavity between the mould and the cap with cement, in order to render the button firm and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>; for the cement entering all the cavities formed by the relievo of the other side, sustains it, prevents its flattening, and preserves its bossie or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>.\n\nButton, in the manage. Button of the reins of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDLE\">bridle</a>, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> of leather, with the reins passed through it, which runs all along the length of the reins. To put a horse under the button, is when a horse is stopped without a rider upon his back, the reins being laid on his neck, and the button lowered so far <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> that the reins bring in the horse's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, and fix it to the true posture or carriage. It is not only the horses which are managed in the hand that must be put under the button; for the same method must be taken with such horses as are bred between two pillars, before they are backed.\n\nButton-Wood.

Dr Hook gives the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of three sorts of button-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, which seem to have been nothing else but the filling up of three several sorts of shells. They are all of them very hard flints; and have this in common, that they consist of two bodies, which seem to have been the filling up of two holes or vents in the shell. Dr Plot describes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> finely iridated from the top, after the manner of some hair buttons. This name is also given to a peculiar species of flate found in the marquisate of Baireith, in a mountain called Fichtelberg; which is extremely different from the common sorts of flate, in that it runs with great ease into glass in five or six hours <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, without the addition of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> or other foreign substance, to promote its vitrification, as other stones require.

This was verified about 50 years ago, when Sir Thomas Delves, of Cheshire, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of a cure he received here, caused an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> to be erected; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a> the foundation for which, they came to the remains of a fold\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> and magnificent structure of Roman workmanship; and in other places of the neighbourhood, very capacious leaden vessels, and other utensils of Roman workmanship, have been discovered. These waters have always been reckoned inferior to those in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOMERSETSHIRE\">Somersetshire</a>; but seem never to have been totally disused. They are mentioned by Leland, as well known 200 years ago; but it is certain they were brought into greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> by Dr Jones in 1572, and by George <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Shrewsbury, who erected a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> over the bath, then composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>. This building was afterwards pulled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, and a more commodious one erected at the expense of the earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVONSHIRE\">Devonshire</a>. In doing this, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> of cures drawn up by the bath-warden, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> physician attending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a>, and subscribed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the patients, was lost.\n\nThe warm waters of Buxton are, the bath, consisting of nine springs, as already mentioned, St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANN\">Ann</a>'s well, and St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>'s or Bingham well. St Ann's well rises at the distance of somewhat more than 32 yards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-east from the bath. It is chiefly supplied from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> on the north side, out of a rock of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASTARD\">bastard</a> marble. It formerly rose into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> basin, shut up within an ancient Roman brick wall, a yard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> within, a yard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> on three sides, and open on the fourth. But, in 1799, Sir Thomas Delves, as already mentioned, erected an arch over it which still continues. It is 12 feet long, and as many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, set round with stone steps on the inside. In the midst of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOME\">dome</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> now springs up into a stone basin two feet square. St Peter's or Bingham well rises about 20 yards south-east of St Ann's. It is also called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEIGH\">Leigh</a>'s well, from a memorable cure received from it by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> of that name. It rises out of a black limestone, in a very dry ground; and is not so warm as St Ann's well.\n\nFrom the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> to the waters, this place has grown into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> straggling town, which is daily increasing. The houses are chiefly, or rather solely, built for the reception of invalids; and many of them are not only commodious, but elegant. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Devonshire has lately erected a most magnificent building in the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRESCENT\">crescent</a>, with piazzas, under which the company walk in wet or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. It is divided into different hotels, shops, &c., with a public coffee-room, and a very elegant room for assemblies and concerts.\n\nThe hot water resembles that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a>. It has a sweet and pleasant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. It contains the calcareous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, together with a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, and an inconsiderable portion of a purging salt, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> can be discovered in it. This water taken inwardly is esteemed good in the diabetes; in bloody <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>; in the bilious cholick; in loss of appetite, and coldness of the stomach; in inward bleedings; in atrophy; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the vessels and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, especially from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>; in cramps and convulsions; in the dry asthma without a fever; and also in barrennesses. Inwardly and outwardly, it is said to be good in rheumatic and scorbutic complaints; in the gout; in inflammation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> and kidneys, and in consumptions of the lungs; also in old strains; in hard callous tumours; in withered and contracted limbs; in the itch, scabs, nodes, chalky swellings, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>, and other similar complaints.\u2014Besides the hot water, there is also a cold chalybeate water, with a rough iron taste: it resembles the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUNBRIDGE\">Tunbridge</a> water in virtues.\n\nFor the methods of composing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> Buxton water, or of impregnating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> water with a greater quantity of its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAS\">gas</a> or with other gases, see Waters, Medicinal.\n\nBuxton, Jedediah, a prodigy with respect to skill in numbers. His father, William Buxton, was school-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> where he was born in 1754: yet Jedediah's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> was so much neglected, that he was never taught to write; and with respect to any other knowledge but that of numbers, seemed always as ignorant as a boy of ten years of age. How he came first to know the relative proportions of numbers, and their progressive denominations, he did not remember; but to this he applied the whole force of his mind, and upon this his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> was constantly fixed, so that he frequently took no cognizance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> objects, and when he did, it was only with respect to their numbers. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> any space of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> was mentioned, he would soon after say it was so many minutes; and if any distance of way, he would assign the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>-breadths, without any question being asked, or any calculation expected by the company. When he once undertook a question, he began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> with amazing facility, after his own method, without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a>, or chalk, or even understanding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> rules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a> as taught in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>. He would stride over a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> or a field, and tell you the contents of it almost as exact as if you had measured it by the chain. In this manner he measured the whole lordship of Elmton, of some thousand acres, belonging to Sir John <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RHODES\">Rhodes</a>, and brought him the contents, not only in acres, roods, and perches, but even in square inches. After this, for his own amusement, he reduced them into square hair-breadths, computing 48 to each side of the inch. His memory was so great, that while revolving a question, he could leave off, and resume the operation again where he left off the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, or at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, or at several months, and proceed regularly till it was completed. His memory would doubtless have been equally retentive with respect to other objects, if he had attended to other objects with equal diligence; but his perpetual application to figures prevented the smallest acquisition of any other knowledge. He was sometimes asked, on his return from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, whether he remembered the text, or any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the sermon; but it never appeared that he brought away one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>, his mind, upon a closer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, being found to have been busied, even during divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, in his favourite operation, either dividing some time, or some space, into the smallest known parts, or revolving some question that had been given him as a test of his abilities.\n\nThis extraordinary person living in laborious poverty, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> was uniform and obscure. Time, with respect to him, changed nothing but his age; nor did the seasons vary his employment, except that in winter he used a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAIL\">flail</a>, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> a ling-hook. In the year 1754, he came to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, where he was introduced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, who, in order to prove his abilities, asked him several questions in arithmetic, and he gave them such satisfaction, that they dismissed him with a handsome gratuity. In this visit to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>,\npolis, the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his curiosity, except figures, was his desire to see the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> and royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>; but they being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> removed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENSINGTON\">Kensington</a>, Jedediah was disappointed. During his residence in London, he was taken to see King Richard III. performed at Drury-lane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PLAYHOUSE\">playhouse</a>; and it was expected, either that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> and the splendour of the show would have fixed him in astonishment, or kept his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> in a continual hurry; or that his passions would, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, have been touched by the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, if he had not perfectly understood the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a>. But Jedediah's mind was employed in the playhouse just as it was employed in every other place. During the dance, he fixed his attention upon the number of steps; he declared, after a fine piece of music, that the innumerable sounds produced by the instruments had perplexed him beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>; and he attended even to Mr Garrick, only to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> the words that he uttered, in which he said he perfectly succeeded. Jedediah returned to the place of his birth, where, if his enjoyments were few, his wishes did not seem to be more. He applied to his labour, by which he subsisted, with cheerfulness; he regretted nothing that he left behind him in London; and it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that a slice of rusty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">bacon</a> afforded the most delicious repast.","sp":39,"ep":41},{"h":"BUXTORF","t":"John, a learned professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASIL\">Basil</a>, who, in the 17th century, acquired the highest reputation, for his knowledge of the Hebrew and Chaldee languages.

All by-laws are to be reasonable, and for the common benefit, not private advantage of particular persons, and must be agreeable to the public laws in being.","sp":41,"ep":41},{"h":"BYBLUS","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">Ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a>, a town of Phoenicia, situated between Berytus and Batrys; it was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> residence of Cinyras; sacred to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADONIS\">Adonis</a>.

At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 15, he went volunteer to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s warrant. His early engagement in this course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> gave him little opportunity of acquiring learn-\ning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> cultivating the polite arts; but by his abilities and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> as a naval commander he furnished abundant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> for the pens of others. After being several times advanced, he was in 1702 raised to the command of the Naflau, a third rate, and was at the taking and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIGO\">Vigo</a>; and the next year he was made rear-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>.

The captain's laconic epistle on this occasion is worthy of notice; which showed that fighting was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> as well as his admiral's, and not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>.\n\n\"Sir,\n\n\"We have taken and destroyed all the Spanish ships and vessels which were upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, as per margin.

The king made the admiral a handsome present, and sent him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLENIPOTENTIARY\">plenipotentiary</a> powers to negotiate with the princes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of Italy as there should be occasion.

It was entirely owing to his advice and assistance that the Germans retook the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Melina in 1719, and destroyed the ships that lay in the haven; which completed the ruin of the naval power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>. The Spaniards being much distressed, offered to quit Sicily; but the admiral declared, that the troops should never be suffered to quit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> till the king of Spain had acceded to the quadruple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a>. And to his conduct it was entirely owing that Sicily was subdued, and his Catholic majesty forced to accept the terms prescribed him by the quadruple alliance. After performing so many signal services, the king received him with the most gracious expressions of favour and satisfaction; made him rear-admiral of England and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>, one of his most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> privy-councils, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Byng of Southill in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEDFORD\">Bedford</a>, Viscount Torrington in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVONSHIRE\">Devonshire</a>, and one of the knights companions of the Bath upon the revival of that order.

It was founded, according to Eusebius, about the 36th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLYMPIAD\">Olympiad</a>, while Tullus Hostilius reigned in Rome. But, according to Diodorus Siculus, the foundations of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> were laid in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the Argonauts, by one Byzas, who then reigned in the neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and from whom the city was called Byzantium. This Byzas, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUSTATHIUS\">Eustathius</a>, arrived in Thrace a little before the Argonauts came into those seas, and settled there with a colony of Megarenese. Velleius Paterculus ascribes the founding of Byzantium to the Milesians, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMIANUS_MARCELLINUS\">Ammianus Marcellinus</a> to the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTICA\">Attica</a>. Some ancient medals of Byzantium, which have reached our times, bear the name and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of Byzas, with the prow of a ship on the reverse. The year after the destruction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a> by Titus, Byzantium was reduced to the form of a Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>. In the year 193 this city took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGER\">Niger</a> against Severus. It was strongly garrisoned by Niger, as being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of the utmost importance. It was soon after invested by Severus; and as he was universally hated on account of his cruelty, the inhabitants defended themselves with the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>. They had been supplied with a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of warlike <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a>, most of them invented and built by Pericus a native of Nicaea, and the greatest engineer of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. For a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time they baffled all the attempts of the assailants, killed great numbers of them, crushed such as approached the walls with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>; and when stones began to fail, they used the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> of their gods and heroes. At last they were obliged to submit, through famine, after having been reduced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of devouring one another. The conqueror put all the magistrates and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>; but spared the engineer Pericus. Before this siege, Byzantium was the greatest, most populous, and wealthiest city of Thrace. It was surrounded by walls of an extraordinary height and breadth: and defended by a great number of towers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> of which were built with such art, that the least noise heard in one of them was immediately conveyed to all the rest. Severus, however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> sooner became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of it, than he commanded it to be laid in ashes. The inhabitants were stripped of all their effects, publicly sold for slaves and the walls levelled with the ground. But by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRONICLE\">chronicle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a> we are informed, that soon after this terrible catastrophe, Severus himself caused a great part of the city to be rebuilt, calling it Antonia from his son <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARACALLA\">Caracalla</a>, who assumed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURNAME\">surname</a> of Byzantium.\n\nAntoninus. In 262, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a> Galienus wreaked his fury on the inhabitants of Byzantium. He intended to besiege it; but on his arrival despaired of being able to make himself master of such a strong place. He was admitted the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, however, into the city; and without any regard to the terms he had agreed to, caused the soldiers and all the inhabitants to be put to the sword. Trebellius Pollio says, that not a single person was left alive. What the reason was for such an extraordinary massacre, we are nowhere informed. In the wars between the emperors Licinius and Maximin the city of Byzantium was obliged to submit to the latter, but was soon after recovered by Licinius. In the year 323, it was taken from Licinius by Constantine the Great, who in 330 enlarged and beautified it, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to make it the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not the first, city in the Roman empire. He began with extending the walls of the ancient city from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> to sea; and while some of the workmen were buried in raising them, others were employed in raising within them a great number of stately buildings, and among others a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> no way inferior in magnificence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> to that of Rome. He built a capitol and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMPHITHEATRE\">amphitheatre</a>, made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CIRCUS\">circus</a> maximus, several forums, porticoes, and public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a>. He divided the whole city into 14 regions, and granted the inhabitants many privileges and immunities. By this means Byzantium became one of the most flourishing and populous cities of the empire. Vast numbers of people flocked thither from Pontus, Thrace, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, Constantine having, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, enacted this year (335), decreed, that such as had lands in those countries should not be at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to dispose of them, nor even leave them to their proper heirs at their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, unless they had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> in this new city. But however furious the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> was that his city should be filled with people, he did not care that it should be inhabited by any but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>. He therefore caused all the idols to be pulled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, and all their churches consecrated to the true God. He built besides an incredible number of churches, and caused crosses to be erected in all the squares and public places. Most of the buildings being finished, it was solemnly dedicated to the Virgin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, according to Cedrenus, but, according to Eusebius, to the God of Martyrs. At the same time Byzantium was equalled to Rome. The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a>, immunities, and privileges, were granted to its inhabitants as to those of the metropolis. He established a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> and other magistrates, with a power and authority equal to those of old Rome.

Add, that F. Montfaucon, in his Pal\u00e6ographia, gives us some forms of the Greek z which come very near to that of our C; thus, for instance, \u03b6; and Suidas calls the C the Roman kappa. The second found of C resembles that of the Greek \u039e; and many instances occur of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSCRIPTIONS\">inscriptions</a>, in which \u039e has the same form with our C. All grammarians agree, that the Romans pronounced their Q like our C, and their C like our K. F. Mabillon adds, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> the Great was the first who wrote his name with a C; whereas all his predecessors of the same name wrote it with a K; and the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> is observed in their coins.\n\nAs an abbreviation, C stands for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIUS\">Caius</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAROLUS\">Carolus</a>, Caesar, condemnno, &c. and CC for confutibus.\n\nAs a numeral, C signifies 100, CC 200, &c.\n\nC, in Music, placed after the clef, intimates that the music is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, which is either quick or slow, as it is joined with allegro, or adagio: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> alone, it is usually adagio. If the C be crossed or turned, the first requires the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> to be played quick, and the last very quick.\n\nCAABA; or CAABAH, properly signifies a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>: but is particularly applied by the Mahometans to the temple at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECCA\">Mecca</a>, built as they pretend, by Abraham and Ishmael his son.\n\nBefore the time of Mahomet, this temple was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of worship for the idolatrous Arabs, and is said to have contained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less than 360 different images, equalling in number the days of the Arabian year. They were all destroyed by Mahomet, who sanctified the Caaba, and appointed it to be the chief place of worship for all true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEVERS\">believers</a>. The temple is in length from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> to south about 24 cubits; its breadth from east to west is 23, and its height 27. The door, which is on the east side, stands about four cubits from the ground; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with the bottom of the door. In the corner next this door is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> stone, so much celebrated among the Mahometans. On the north side of the Caaba, within a semicircular enclosure 50 cubits <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, lies the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> stone, said to be the sepulchre of Ishmael, which receives the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> from the Caaba by a spout formerly of wood, but now of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>. The black stone, according to the Mahometans, was brought <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> by Gabriel at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> of the world, and was originally of a white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>; but contracted the blackness that now appears on it from the guilt of those sins committed by the sons of men. It is set in silver, and fixed in the south-east corner of the Caaba, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> towards Bafra, about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> spans from the ground. This stone, upon which there is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, is held in the highest estimation among the Arabs; all the pilgrims killing it with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>, and some even calling it the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of God. Its blackness, which is only superficial, is probably owing to the kisses and touches of so many people. After the Karmatians had taken Mecca, they carried away this precious stone, and could by no means be prevailed upon to restore it; but finding at last that they were unable to prevent the concourse of pilgrims to Mecca, they sent it back of their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a>, after having kept it 22 years.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> of the Caaba is supported within by three octagonal pillars of aloes wood; between which, on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, hang some silver lamps. The outside is covered with rich black damask, adorned with an embroidered band of gold, which is changed every year, and was formerly sent by the caliphs, afterwards by the sultans of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, and is now provided by the Turkish emperors. The Caaba, at some distance, is almost surrounded by a circular enclosure of pillars, joined towards the bottom by a low balustrade, and towards the top by bars of silver. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">Just</a> without this inner enclosure, on the south, north, and west sides of the Caaba, are three buildings, which are the oratories or places where three of the orthodox sects assembled to perform their devotions. Towards the south-east stands an edifice which covers the well Zamzem, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>, and the cupola of Al Abbas. Formerly there was another cupola, that went under the name of the hemicycle or cupola of Judea; but whether or not any remains of that are now to be seen is unknown; nor is it easy to obtain information in this respect, all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> being denied access to this holy place. At a small distance from the Caaba, on the east side, is the flat or place of Abraham; where is another stone much respected by the Mahometans; and where they pretend to show the footsteps of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a>, telling us he stood on it when he built the Caaba. Here the fourth feet of Arabs, viz. that of Al Shafei, assemble for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> purposes.\n\nThe square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLONNADE\">colonnade</a>, or great piazza, which at a considerable distance encloses these buildings, consists, according to Al Jannabi, of 488 pillars, and has no less than 38 gates. Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">Sale</a> compares this piazza to that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">Exchange</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, but allows it to be much larger. It is covered with small domes or cupolas, from the four corners of which rise as many minarets or steeples, with double galleries, and adorned with gilded spires and crescents after the Turkish manner, as are also the cupolas which cover the piazza and other buildings. Between the columns of both enclosures hang a great number of lamps, which are constantly\nconstantly lighted at night. The first foundation of this second enclosure was laid by Omar the second caliph, who built no more than a low wall, to prevent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of the Caaba from being encroached upon by private buildings; but by the liberality of succeeding princes, the whole has been raised to that state of magnificence in which it appears at present.\n\nThis temple enjoys the privilege of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a> for all sorts of criminals: but it is most remarkable for the pilgrimages made to it by the devout Mussulmans, who pay so great a veneration to it, that they believe a single sight of its sacred walls, without any particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of devotion, is as meritorious in the sight of God, as the most careful discharge of one's duty, for the space of a whole year, in any other temple.","sp":43,"ep":45},{"h":"CAAMINI","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">Botany</a>, a name given by the Spaniards and others to the finest sort of Paraguayan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>.

The first whereof consists in taking the letters of a Hebrew word for ciphers or arithmetical numbers, and explaining every word by the arithmetical value of the letters whereof it is composed.

Another smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> they called St John, from its being discovered on the feast of St John Baptist; after which, they sailed along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of America as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLORIDA\">Florida</a>, and then returned to England.\nland with a good cargo, and three Indians aboard.\n\nStowe and Speed ascribe these discoveries wholly to Sebastian, without mentioning his father. It is probable that Sebastian, after his father's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, made several voyages to these parts, as a map of his discoveries, drawn by himself, was hung up in the privy garden at Whitehall. However, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> gives but little account of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> for near 20 years: when he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, where he was made pilot-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">major</a>, and intrusted with reviewing all projects for discoveries, which were then very numerous. His great capacity and approved integrity induced many eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> to treat with him about a voyage by the new found straits of Magellan to the Moluccas. He therefore sailed in 1523, first to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANARIES\">Canaries</a>; then to the Cape de Verd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>; thence to St Augustine and the island of Patos; when some of his people beginning to be mutinous, and refusing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through the straits, he laid aside the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of sailing to the Moluccas; left some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> mutineers upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> island; and, failing up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> of Plate and Paraguay, discovered, and built forts in, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> tract of fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, that produced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, silver, and other rich commodities. He hence despatched messengers to Spain for a supply of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, ammunition, goods for trade, and a recruit of men: but his request not being readily complied with, after staying five years in America, he returned home; where he met with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> reception, the merchants being displeased at his not having pursued his voyage to the Moluccas, while his treatment of the mutineers had given umbrage at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>. Hence he returned to England; and being introduced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Somerset, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> protector, a new office was erected for him: he was made governor of the mystery and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of the merchant-adventurers for the discovery of regions, dominions, islands, and places unknown; a pension was granted him, by letters patent, of 166l. 13s. 4d. per annum; and he was consulted in all affairs relative to trade. In 1522, by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, the court fitted out some ships for the discovery of the northern parts of the world. This produced the first voyage the English made to Russia, and the beginning of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> which has ever since been carried on between the two nations. The Russia company was now founded by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a> granted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>; and of this company Sebastian was appointed governor for life.

N. Lat. 22\u00b0. 10. at about 80 leagues distance from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. It is prodigiously crowded with people, insomuch that the streets are hardly passable, especially on market days. These vast crowds, however, come mostly from the neighbouring villages; upon which account these villages have been allowed their halls in particular parts of the city, where they bring and dispose of their wares. The town itself, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> of the whole Tonquinese kingdom, hath neither walls nor fortifications. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> streets are wide and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIRY\">airy</a>, but the rest of them narrow and ill paved; and except the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> and arsenal, the town has little else worth notice. The houses are low and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a>, mostly built of wood and clay, and not above one story <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>. The magazines and warehouses belonging to foreigners are the only edifices built of brick; and these, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, yet, by reason of their height and more elegant structure, make a considerable show among those rows of wooden huts. From the combustibility of its edifices, this city suffers frequent and dreadful conflagrations. These spread with such surprising velocity, that some thousands of houses are often laid in ashes before the fire can be extinguished. To prevent these sad consequences, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> hath, either in its yard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> even in its centre, some low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of brick, in form of an oven, into which the inhabitants on the first alarm convey their most valuable goods. Besides this precaution, which every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> takes to secure their goods, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> obliges them to keep a cistern, or some other capacious vessel, always full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> on the top of their house, to be ready on all occasions of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>: as likewise a long pole and bucket, to throw water from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENNEL\">kennel</a> upon the houses. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> these two expedients fail of suppressing the flames, they immediately cut the straws which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> on the thatch to the walls, and let it fall in and waste itself on the ground. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s palace stands in the centre of the city; and is surrounded with a stout wall, within whose circuiture are seen a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of apartments two stories high, whose fronts and portals have something of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. Those of the king and his wives are embellished with variety of carvings and gildings after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> manner, and all finely varnished. In the outer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> are a vast number of sumptuous stables for the king's horses and elephants. The appearance of the inner courts can only be conjectured; for the avenues are not only shut to all strangers, but even to the king's subjects, except those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-PRIVY_COUNCIL\">privy <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> ministers of state; yet we are told, that there are staircases by which people may mount up to the top of the walls, which are about 18 or 20 feet high; from whence they may have a distant view of the royal apartments, and of the fine parterres and fish ponds that are between the circuiture and them. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> wall hath a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> gate well ornamented, which is never opened but when the king goes in and out; but at some distance from it on each side there are two posterns, at which the courtiers and servants may go in and out. This circuiture, which is of a vast circumference, is faced with brick within and without, and the whole structure is terminated by wide spacious gardens; which, though stored with great variety of proper ornaments, are destitute of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> and elegance observed in the palaces of European princes. Besides this palace, the ruins of one still more magnificent are to be observed, and are called Libarina. The circumference is said to have been between six and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> miles; some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>, porticoes, and other ornaments are still remaining; from which, and some of its courts paved with marble, it may be concluded to have been as magnificent a structure as any of the eastern parts can show. The arsenal is likewise a large and noble building, well stored with ammunition and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>. The English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTORY\">factory</a> is situated on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> side of the city, fronting the river Song-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEY\">key</a>. It is a handsome low-built house, with a spacious dining room in the centre; and on each side are the apartments of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, factors, and servants. At each end of the building are smaller houses for other uses, as storehouses, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a>, &c., which form two wings with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> in the middle, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> with the river, near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of which stands a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a>, on which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> display the English colours on Sundays and all remarkable days. Adjoining to it, on the south side, is the Danish factory, which is neither so large nor so handsome. On the same side of the river runs a long dike, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> are so firmly fastened together, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of it can be stirred without moving the whole. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> was raised on those banks to prevent the river, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of their vast rains, from overflowing the city; and it has hitherto answered its end; for though the town stands high enough to be in no danger from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> floods, it might yet have been otherwise frequently damaged, if not totally laid under water, by the overflowing of that river.

They are all drawn in straight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, and most of them intersect each other at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>. The swarms of rats that in the nights run about the streets are innumerable; whole droves of them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> and repass continually, and these their midnight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REVELS\">revels</a> are extremely troublesome to such as walk late. The houses are lofty, with each a vestibule, which being left open till night, serves passengers to retire to; this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, which prevails throughout Spain, renders these places exceedingly offensive. In the middle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> like a deep well, under which is generally a cistern, the breeding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of gnats and moquitoes; the ground floors are warehouses, the first stories counting-house or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> apartment up two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of stairs. The roofs are flat, covered with an impenetrable cement, and few are without a mirador or turret for the purpose of commanding a view of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. Round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAPET\">parapet</a>-wall at top are placed rows of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> pillars, meant either for ornament according to some traditional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECORATION\">decoration</a>, or to fix awnings to, that such as sit there for the benefit of the sea breeze may be sheltered from the rays of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>; but the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> made of them, is to fasten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a> for drying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> upon. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">High</a> above all these pinnacles, which give Cadiz a most singular appearance, stands\nthe tower of signals.

The ships are acquainted with the proper signals to be made, and these are repeated by the watchmen of the tower: as painted lists are in every house, persons concerned in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> soon learn the marks.\n\nThe city is divided into 24 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, under the inspection of as many commissioners of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a>; and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> is reckoned at 140,000 inhabitants, of which 12,000 are French, and at least as many more Italians. The square of Saint Antonia is large, and tolerably handsome, and there are a few smaller openings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>. The public walk, or Alameda, is pleasant in the evening: it is fenced off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COACH\">coach</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> by a marble rail. The sea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> prevents the trees from thriving, and destroys all hopes of future <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>.\n\nFrom the Alameda, continuing your walk westwards, you come to the Campolanto, a large esplanade, the only airing-place for coaches; it turns round most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the west and south sides of the island, but the buildings are straggling and ugly; the only edifice of any show is the new orphan house; opposite to it is the fortress of St Sebastian, built on a neck of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> running out into the sea. The round tower at the extremity is supposed to have saved the city, in the great earthquake of 1755, from being swept away by the fury of the waves. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> proved sufficiently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> to withstand the shock, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> that threatened destruction to the whole island. In the narrow part of the isthmus the surge <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> over with amazing impetuosity, and bore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> all before it; among the rest, the grandson of the famous tragic poet Racine, who strove in vain to escape, by urging his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> to the utmost of his speed. On St Sebastian's feast, a kind of wake or fair is held in the fort; an astonishing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of people then passing and repassing, on a string of wooden bridges laid from rock to rock, makes a very lively moving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>.\n\nFrom hence to the wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CIRCUS\">circus</a> where they exhibit the bull feasts, you keep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> to the left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> above the sea, which on all this side dashes over large ledges of rock: the shore seems here absolutely inaccessible. On this shore stands the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of great expense, but carried on with so little vigour, that it is difficult to guess at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of years it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> require to bring it to perfection. The vaults are executed with great solidity. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> from the cluttered pilasters to support the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, are very bold; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a> bestowed upon them seems superfluous, as all the effect will be lost from their great height, and from the shade that will be thrown upon them by the filling up of the interstices. From the sea, the present top of the church resembles the carcase of some huge monster <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> upon its side, rearing its gigantic blanched ribs high above the buildings of the city. The outward casings are to be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> marble, the bars of the windows of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRONZE\">bronze</a>.\n\nNext, crossing before the land gate and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRACKS\">barracks</a>, a superb edifice for strength, convenience, and cleanliness, you come down to the ramparts that defend the city on the side of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>. If the prospect to the ocean is solemn, that towards the main land is animated in the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>; the men of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> ride in the eastern booms of the bay; lower down the merchantmen are spread far and near; and close to the town an incredible number of barks, of various shapes and sizes, cover the surface of the water, some moored and some in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, carrying goods to and fro. The opposite shore of Spain is studded with white houses, and enlivened by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> of St Mary's, Port-real, and others, behind which, half-way, on a ridge of hills, stands <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol0.html#article-MEDINA_SIDONIA\">Medina Sidonia</a>, and further back rise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANADA\">Granada</a>. Westward, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROTA\">Rota</a> closes the horizon, near which was anciently the island and city of Tartessos, now covered by the sea, but at low water some part of the ruins are still to be discerned. In a large baillon, jutting out into the bay, they have built the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CUSTOM_HOUSE\">custom-house</a>, the first story of which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with the walk upon the walls. When it was resolved to erect a building so necessary to this great emporium of trade, the marquis di Squillace gave orders that no expense should be spared, and the most intelligent architects employed, in order to erect a monument, which by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and magnificence might excite the admiration of posterity: the result of these precautions proved a piece of vile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, composed of the worst of materials.\n\nThe fire here is prodigious during the last months of the stay of the flota. The packers polish the art of pressing goods to great perfection; but, as they pay the freight according to the cubic palms of each bale, they are apt to squeeze down the cloths and linens so very close and hard, as sometimes to render them unfit for use. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a> of French luxuries in drapery is enormous; Lyons furnishes most of them; England sends out bale goods; Brittany and the north linens. Every commercial nation has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a> resident at Cadiz; those of England and France are the only ones not allowed to have any concern in trade.\n\nIn 1596, Cadiz was taken, pillaged, and burnt by the English; but in 1702 it was attempted in conjunction with the Dutch, without success.","sp":51,"ep":52},{"h":"CADIZADELITES","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> of Mahometans very like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Stoics.

Edward undertook this great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> immediately after his conquest of the country in 1282, and completed the fortifications and castle before 1284; for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>, on April 23rd in that year, brought forth within its walls Edward, first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of Wales of the English line.

The gate had four portcullises, and every requisite of strength. The towers are very beautiful. The eagle tower is remarkably fine, and has the addition of three slender angular turrets rising from the top. Edward II. was born in a little dark room in this tower, not twelve feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> nor eight in breadth: so little did, in those days, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> comfort consult either pomp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> convenience. The gate through which the affectionate Eleanor entered, to give the Welsh a prince of their own, who could not speak a word of English, is at the farthest end, at a vast height above the outside ground; so could only be approached by a drawbridge. The quay is a most beautiful walk along the side of the Menai, and commands a most agreeable view.\n\nCaernarvon is destitute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>, but has a brisk trade with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, for the several necessaries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>.

See Botany Index.\n\nC\u00c6SAR, Julius, the illustrious Roman general and historian, was of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of the Julii, who pretended they were descended from Venus by Aeneas. The descendants of Alcanius, son of Aeneas and Creusa, and surnamed Julius, lived in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBA\">Alba</a> till that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> was ruined by Tullus Hostilius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Rome, who carried them to Rome, where they flourished. We do not find that they produced more than two branches. The first bore the name of Tullus, the other that of Caesar. The most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> of the Caesars were those who were in public employments in the 7th year of the first Punic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>. After that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> we find there was always some of that family who enjoyed public offices in the commonwealth, till the time of Gaius Julius Caesar, the subject of this article. He was born at Rome the 12th of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> Quintilis, year of the city 653, and lost his father an. 669. By his valour and eloquence he soon acquired the highest reputation in the field and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>. Beloved and respected by his fellow citizens, he enjoyed successively every magisterial and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> the public could bestow consistent with its own free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>. But at length having subdued Pompey the great rival of his growing power, his boundless ambition effaced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of his former actions: for, pursuing his favourite maxim, \"that he had rather be the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> in a village than the second in Rome,\" he procured himself to be chosen perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DICTATOR\">dictator</a>; and, not content with this unconstitutional power, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a> had resolved to raise him to the imperial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>; when the friends of the civil liberties of the republic rally affianced him in the senate-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, where they should only have seized him and brought him to a legal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> for usurpation. By this impolitic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> they defeated their own purpose, involving the city in consternation and terror, which produced general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a>, and paved the way to the revolution they wanted to prevent; the monarchial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> being absolutely founded on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> of Julius Caesar. He fell in the 56th year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, 43 years before\nbefore the Christian era. His commentaries contain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> voyages, battles, and victories. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> edition in 1712, in folio, is preferred.\n\nThe detail of C\u00e6sar's transactions (so far as is consistent with the limits of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>) being given under the article Rome, we shall here only add a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> of him as drawn by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>.*\n\n* From the Melanges Philosophiques of M. Opheliot.\n\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a>, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of 18 centuries, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> may be published without offence, a philosopher might, in the following terms, censure C\u00e6sar without calumniating him, and applaud him without exciting his blushes.\n\n\"C\u00e6sar had one predominant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>: it was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of glory; and he passed 40 years of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> in seeking opportunities to foster and encourage it. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>, entirely absorbed in ambition, did not open itself to other impulses. He cultivated letters; but he did not love them with enthusiasm, because he had not leisure to become the first orator of Rome. He corrupted the one half of the Roman ladies, but his heart had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> concern in the fiery ardours of his senses. In the arms of Cleopatra, he thought of Pompey; and this singular man, who disdained to have a partner in the empire of the world, would have blushed to have been for one instant the slave of a woman.\n\n\"We must not imagine, that C\u00e6sar was born a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a>, as Sophocles and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a> were born poets. For, if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> had made him a citizen of Sybaris, he would have been the most voluptuous of men. If in our days he had been born in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENNSYLVANIA\">Pennsylvania</a>, he would have been the most inoffensive of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUAKERS\">Quakers</a>, and would not have disturbed the tranquillity of the new world.\n\n\"The moderation with which he conducted himself after his victories, has been highly extolled; but in this he showed his penetration, not the goodness of his heart. Is it not obvious, that the display of certain virtues is necessary to put in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> machine? It was requisite that he should have the appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLEMENCY\">clemency</a>, if he inclined that Rome should forgive him his victories. But what greatness of mind is there in a generosity which follows on the usurpation of the supreme power?\n\n\"Nature, while it marked C\u00e6sar with a sublime character, gave him also that spirit of perseverance which renders it useful. He had no sooner begun to reflect, than he admired Sylla; hated him, and yet wished to imitate him. At the age of 15, he formed the project of being dictator. It was thus that the prescient Montesquieu conceived, in his early youth, the idea of the Spirit of Laws.\n\n\"Physical qualities, as well as moral causes, contributed to give strength to his character. Nature, which had made him for command, had given him an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of dignity. He had acquired that loft and infusing eloquence, which is perfectly suited to seduce vulgar minds, and has a powerful influence on the most cultivated. His love of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> was a merit with the fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>; and women, who even in a republic can draw to them the suffrages and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of men, have the highest importance in degenerate times. The ladies of his age were charmed with the prospect of having a dictator whom they might subdue by their attractions.\n\n\"In vain did the genius of Cato watch for some time to sustain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. It was unequal to contend with that of C\u00e6sar. Of what avail were the eloquence, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of this republican, when opposed by a man who had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> to debauch the wife of every citizen whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> he meant to engage; who, possessing an enthusiasm for glory, wept, because, at the age of 30, he had not conquered the world like Alexander; and who, with the haughty temper of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESPOT\">despot</a>, was more desirous to be the first man in a village than the second in Rome.\n\n\"C\u00e6sar had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> to exist in times of trouble and civil commotions, when the minds of men are put into a ferment; when opportunities of great actions are frequent; when talents are everything, and those who can only boast of their virtues are nothing. If he had lived an hundred years sooner, he would have been no more than an obscure villain; and, instead of giving laws to the world, would not have been able to produce any confusion in it.\n\n\"I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> here be bold enough to advance an idea, which may appear paradoxical to those who weakly judge of men from what they achieve, and not from the principle which leads them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>. Nature formed in the same mould C\u00e6sar, Mahomet, Cromwell, and Kouli Khan. They all of them united to genius that profound policy which renders it so powerful. They all of them had an evident superiority over those with whom they were surrounded; they were conscious of this superiority, and they made others conscious of it. They were all of them born subjects, and became fortunate usurpers. Had C\u00e6sar been placed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, he would have made the conquest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, he would have been the founder of a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>; in London, he would have stabbed his sovereign, or have procured his assassination under the sanction of the laws. He reigned with glory over men whom he had reduced to be slaves; and, under one aspect, he is to be considered as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a>; under another, as a monster. But it would be unfortunate, indeed, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, if the possession of superior talents gave individuals a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to trouble its repose. Usurpers accordingly have flatterers, but no friends; strangers respect them; their subjects complain and submit; it is in their own families that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> finds her avengers. C\u00e6sar was assassinated by his son, Mahomet was poisoned by his wife, Kouli Khan was massacred by his nephew, and Cromwell only died in his bed because his son Richard was a philosopher.\n\n\"C\u00e6sar, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a> of his country; C\u00e6sar, who destroyed the agents of his crimes, if they failed in address; C\u00e6sar, in fine, the husband of every wife, and the wife of every husband, has been accounted a great man by the mob of writers. But it is only the philosopher who knows how to mark the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> between celebrity and greatness. The talents of this singular man, and the good fortune which constantly attended him till the moment of his assassination, have concealed the enormity of his actions.\"\n\nC\u00e6sar, in Roman antiquity, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>, borne by all the emperors, from Julius C\u00e6sar to the destruction of the empire. It was also used as a title of distinction for the intended or presumptive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> of the empire, as king of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> is now used for that of the German empire.\nThis title took its rise from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURNAME\">surname</a> of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>, C. Julius C\u00e6sar, which, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> of the senate all the succeeding emperors were to bear. Under his successor, the appellation of Augustus being appropriated to the emperors, in compliment to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, the title C\u00e6sar was given to the second person in the empire, though still it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be given to the first; and hence the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> betwixt C\u00e6sar used simply, and C\u00e6sar with the addition of Imperator Augustus.\n\nThe dignity of C\u00e6sar remained to the second of the empire, till Alexius Comnenus having elected Nicephorus Melissenus C\u00e6sar by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a>; and it being necessary to confer some higher dignity on his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Isaacius, he created him Sebasticator with the precedence over Melissenus; ordering, that in all acclamations, &c., Isaacius Sebasticator should be named the second, and Melissenus C\u00e6sar the third.\n\nC\u00e6sar, Sir Julius, a learned civilian, was descended by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> line from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> de C\u00e6farini in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>; and was born near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TOTTENHAM\">Tottenham</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIDDLESEX\">Middlesex</a>, in the year 1557. He was educated at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, and afterwards studied in the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, where, in the year 1581, he was created <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CIVIL_LAW\">civil <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, and two years after was admitted to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> at Oxford, and also became doctor of the canon law. He was advanced to many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> employments, and for the last 20 years of his life was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the rolls. He was remarkable for his extensive bounty and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> to all persons of worth, so that he seemed to be the almoner-general of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>. He died in 1639, in the 79th year of his age. It is very remarkable that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a> of this lawyer were offered (by the executors of some of his descendants) to a cheesemonger for waste <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>; but being timely inspected by Mr Samuel Paterson, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> discovered their worth, and had the satisfaction to find his judgment confirmed by the profession, to whom they were sold in lots for upwards of 500l. in the year 1757.\n\nC\u00e6sar Augusta, or Cesarea Augusta, in Ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a>, a Roman colony situated on the river Iberus in the Hither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, before called Salduba, in the territories of the Edetani.

It was very conveniently situated for trade; but had a very dangerous harbour, so that no ships could be safe in it when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> was at south-west. Herod the Great king of Judea remedied this inconvenience at an immense expense and labour, making it one of the most convenient havens on that coast.

His father had served in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, which he quitted, and in his retirement studied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>; and amused himself with mechanic exercises, wherein he proved the happy author of several inventions of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> to the public. Nicholas, almost in his infancy, took a fancy to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, which proved of signal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to him in his maturer years. He was sent young to school at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANTES\">Mantes</a>-sur-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEINE\">Seine</a>, where he discovered early tokens of genius. In 1729, he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>; where he studied the classics, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, and mathematics. Afterwards he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> de Navarre, proposing to embrace an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. At the end of three years he was ordained a deacon, and officiated as such in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of the college de Mazarin several years; but he never entered into priests orders, apprehending that his astronomical studies, to which he became most assiduously devoted, might too much interfere with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> duties. In 1739, he was conjoined with M. de Thury, son to M. Caffini, in verifying the meridian of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">observatory</a> through the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of France. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of November the same year, whilst he was engaged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> and night in the operations which this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> undertaking required, and at a great distance from Paris, he was, without any solicitation, elected into the vacant mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> which the celebrated M. Varignon had so worthily filled. Here he began to teach about the end of 1740; and an observatory was ordered to be erected for his use in the college, and furnished with a suitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> of the best instruments. In May 1741, M. de la Caille was admitted into the Royal Academy of Sciences as an adjoint member for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>. Besides the many excellent papers of his dispersed up and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a>, he published Elements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">Geometry</a>, mechanics, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">optics</a>, and astronomy. Moreover, he carefully computed all the eclipses of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> that had happened since the Christian era, which were printed in a book published by two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEDICTINES\">Benedictines</a>, entitled l'art de verifier les dates, &c. Paris, 1750, in 4to. Besides these he compiled a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of astronomical ephemerides for the years 1745 to 1755; another for the years 1755 to 1765; a third for the years 1765 to 1775; an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> entitled Astronomia fundamenta.\nmenta novissimis solis et stellarum observationibus stabilita: and the most correct solar tables that ever appeared. Having gone through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of astronomical observations in his own observatory, he formed a project of going to observe the southern stars at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good Hope. This was highly approved by the academy, and by the prime minister Comte de Argenon, and very readily agreed to by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>. Upon this he drew up a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of the method he proposed to pursue in his southern observations; setting forth, that, besides settling the places of the fixed stars, he proposed to determine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLAX\">parallax</a> of the moon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a>, and Venus. But whereas this required correspondent observations to be made in the northern parts of the world, he sent to those of his correspondents who were expert in practical astronomy previous notice, in print, what observations he designed to make at such and such times for the said purpose. At length, on the 21st of November 1750, he sailed for the Cape, and arrived there on the 19th of April 1751. He forthwith got his instruments on shore; and with the assistance of some Dutch artificers, set about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> an astronomical observatory, in which his apparatus of instruments was properly disposed of as soon as it was in a fit condition to receive them.\n\nThe sky at the Cape is generally pure and serene, unless when a south-east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> blows: But this is often the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, and when it is, it is attended with some strange and terrible effects. The stars look bigger, and seem to caper; the moon has an undulating tremor; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a> have a foot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a> like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMETS\">comets</a>. Two hundred and twenty-eight nights did our astronomer survey the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the southern heavens; during which space, which is almost incredible, he observed more than 10,000 stars; and whereas the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> filled the heavens with monsters and old wives tales, the abb\u00e9 de la Caille chose rather to adorn them with the instruments and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> philosophy has made use of for the conquest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>*. With <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less success did he attend to the parallax of the moon, Mars, Venus, and the sun. Having thus executed the purpose of his voyage, and no present opportunity offering for his return, he thought of employing the vacant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> in another arduous attempt; no less than that of taking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, as he had already done that of the heavens. This, indeed, had, through the munificence of the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, been done before by different sets of learned men both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>; some determining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> under the equator, and others under the arctic circle: but it had not as yet been decided whether in the southern parallels of latitude the same dimensions obtained as in the northern. His labours were rewarded with the satisfaction he wished for; having determined a distance of 410,814 feet from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> called Klip Fontyn to the Cape, by means of a base of 38,802 feet, three times actually measured: whence he discovered a new secret of nature, namely, that the radii of the parallels in south latitude are not the same as those of the corresponding parallels in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> latitude. About the 23rd degree of south latitude he found a degree on the meridian to contain 3,422,222 Paris feet. He returned to Paris the 27th of September 1754; having in his almost four years absence expended no more than 9,144 livres on himself and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>; and at his coming into port, he refused a cai macan's bribe of 100,000 livres, offered by one who thirsted less after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a>, to be sharer in his immunity from customhouse searches.\n\nAfter receiving the congratulatory visits of his more intimate friends and the astronomers, he first of all thought fit to draw up a reply to some strictures which Professor Euler had published relative to the meridian, and then he settled the results of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of his own with the observations of other astronomers for the parallaxes. That of the sun he fixed at 9\u00b0 15' of the moon at 56\u00b0 56' of Mars in its opposition, 36\u00b0 of Venus, 38\u00b0. He also settled the laws whereby astronomical refractions are varied by the different density or rarity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, and dryness or moisture. And, lastly, He showed an easy, and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> navigators practicable, method of finding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> by means of the moon, which he illustrated by examples selected from his own observations during his voyages. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> being now established upon so firm a basis, the most celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">academies</a> of Europe claimed him as their own: and he was unanimously elected a member of the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>; of the institute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>; of the imperial academy at Petersburgh; and of the royal academies at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOCKHOLM\">Stockholm</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOTTINGEN\">Gottingen</a>. In the year 1760, M. de la Caille was attacked with a severe fit of the gout; which, however, did not interrupt the course of his studies; for he then planned out a new and immense work; no less than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of astronomy through all ages, with a comparison of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and modern observations, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> and use of the instruments employed in making them. In order to pursue the task he had imposed upon himself in a suitable retirement, he obtained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> of apartments in the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of Vincennes; and whilst his astronomical apparatus was erecting there, he began <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> his Catalogue of the Southern Stars, and the third volume of his Ephemerides. The state of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> was, towards the end of the year 1763, greatly reduced. His blood grew inflamed; he had pains of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, obstructions of the kidneys, loss of appetite, with a fullness of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>. His mind remained unaffected, and he resolutely persisted in his studies as usual. In the month of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, medicines were administered to him, which rather aggravated than alleviated his symptoms; and he was now sensible, that the same distemper which in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, ten years before, yielded to a few simple remedies, did in his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> bid defiance to the best physicians.

They have supposed them to have been, in times of inauguration, the places where the chieftain elect stood to show himself to best advantage to the people; or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> from whence judgment was pronounced; or to have been erected on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>-side in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a>; or to have been formed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of some solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a>, particularly where accompanied by standing pillars of stones; or for the celebration of certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> ceremonies. Such might have been the reasons, in some instances, where the evidences of stone chiefs and urns are wanting: but there are to generally found that they seem to determine the most usual purpose of the piles in question to have been for sepulchral monuments. Even this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> might render them suitable to other purposes; particularly religious, to which by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> they might be supposed to give additional solemnity.\u2014According to Toland, fires were kindled on the tops or flat stones, at certain times of the year, particularly on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVE\">eve</a> of the 1st of May and the 1st of November, for the purpose of sacrificing; at which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> all the people having extinguished their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> hearths rekindled them from the sacred fires of the cairns. In general, therefore, these accumulations appear to have been designed for the sepulchral protection of heroes and great men. The stone chiefs, the repository of the urns and ashes, are lodged in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> beneath: sometimes only one, sometimes more, are found thus deposited; and Mr Pennant mentions an instance of 17 being discovered under the same pile.\n\nCairns are of different sizes, some of them very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>. Mr Pennant describes one in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARRAN\">Arran</a>, 114 feet over, and of a vast height. They may justly be supposed to have been proportioned in size to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of the person, or to his popularity: the people of a whole district assembled to show their respect to the deceased; and, by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> honouring of his memory, soon accumulated heaps equal to those that attested us at this time. But these honours were not merely those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as the memory of the deceased endured, not a passenger went by without adding a stone to the heap: they supposed it would be an honour to the dead, and acceptable to his manes.\n\nQuamquam festinas, non efl mora longa: licebit\nInjetlo ter pulvera, curras.\n\nTo this moment there is a proverbial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> among the Highlanders allusive to the old practice; a suppliant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> tell his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a>, Curri mi cloch er do charne, \u201cI will add a stone to your cairn;\u201d meaning, When you are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more, I will do all possible honour to your memory.\n\nCairns are to be found in all parts of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, in Cornwall, Wales, and all parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> Britain; they were in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> among the northern nations; Dahlberg, in his 32nd plate, has given the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of one.

N. Lat. 30\u00b0 O. It was founded by Jawhar, a Magrebian general, in the year of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEGIRA\">Hegira</a> 358. He had laid the foundation of it under the horoscope of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a>; and for that reason gave his new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> the name of Al Kabira, or the Victorious, an epithet applied by the Arab astronomers to that planet. In 362 it became the residence of the caliphs of Egypt, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> the capital of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and has ever since <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be so. It is divided into the New and Old cities. Old Cairo is on the eastern side of the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a>, and is now almost uninhabited. The new, which is properly Cairo, is seated in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> plain about two miles and a half from the old city. It stands on the western side of the Nile, from which it is not three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> distant. It is extended along the mountain on which the castle is built, for the sake of which it was removed hither, in order, as some pretend, to be under its protection. However, the change is much for the worse, as well with regard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and the pleasantness of the prospect. Bulack may be called the port of Cairo; for it stands on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of the Nile, about a mile and a half from it, and all the corn and other commodities are landed there before they are brought to the city. Some travellers have made Cairo of a most enormous magnitude, by taking in the old city, Bulack, and the new; the real circumference of it, however, is not above ten miles, but it is extremely populous. The first thing that strikes a traveller is the narrowness of the streets,\nstreets, and the appearance of the housetops. These are so daubed with mud on the outside, that you would think they were built with nothing else. Besides, as the streets are unpaved, and always full of people, the walking in them is very inconvenient, especially to strangers. To remedy this, there are a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of asses, which always stand ready to be hired for a trifle, that is, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENNY\">penny</a> a mile. The owners drive them along, and give notice to the crowd to make way. And here it may be observed, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> in this, as well as other parts of the Turkish dominions, are not permitted to ride upon horses. The number of the inhabitants can only be guessed at; but we may conclude it to be very great, because in some years the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> carry off 200,000, without their being much missed. The housetops are from one to two or three stories <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, and flat at the top; where they take the air, and often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> all night. The better sort of these have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> on the inside like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> run of housetops have very little room, and even among great people it is usual for 20 or 30 to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a>. Some housetops will hold 300 persons of both sexes, among whom are 20 or 30 slaves; and those of ordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> have generally three or four.\n\nThere is a canal called Khaliq, which runs along the city from one end to the other, with housetops on each side, which make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> straight street. Besides this, there are several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, which are called birks in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of the country. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> of these, which is near the castle, is 500 paces in diameter. The most elegant housetops in the city are built on its banks; but what is extraordinary, eight months in the year it contains water, and the other four it appears with a charming verdure. When there is water sufficient, it is always full of gilded boats, barges, and barks, in which people of condition take their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> towards night, at which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> there are curious fireworks, and variety of music.\n\nNew Cairo is surrounded with walls built with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, on which are handsome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLEMENTS\">battlements</a>, and at the distance of every hundred paces there are very fine towers, which have room for a great number of people. The walls were never very high, and are in many places gone to ruin. The batha lives in the castle, which was built by Saladin 700 years ago. It stands in the middle of the famous mountain Moketan, which terminates in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, after it had accompanied the Nile from Ethiopia hither. This castle is the only place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> in Egypt; and yet the Turks take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> notice of its falling, insomuch that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time it will become a heap of rubbish. The principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> in it is a magnificent hall, environed with 12 columns of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a>, of a prodigious height and thickness, which sustain an open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOME\">dome</a>, under which Saladin distributed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to his subjects. Round this dome there is an inscription in relievo, which determines the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a> and by whom it was built. From this place the whole city of Cairo may be seen, and above 30 miles along the Nile, with the fruitful plains that lie near it, as well as the mosques, pyramids, villages, and gardens, with which these fields are covered. These granite pillars were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of antiquity, for they were got out of the ruins of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>. There are likewise in the mosques and in the principal housetops no less than 40,000 more, besides great magazines, where all kinds are to be had at very low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a>. A janizary happened to find five in his garden, as large as those in the castle; but could not find any machine of strength sufficient to move them, and therefore had them sawed in pieces to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILLSTONES\">millstones</a>. It is believed that there have been 30 or 40,000 of these pillars brought from Alexandria, where there are yet many more to be had. The gates of Cairo are three, which are very fine and magnificent.\n\nThere are about 300 public mosques in this city, some of which have six minarets. The mosque of Asher hath several buildings adjoining, which were once a famous university, and 14,000 scholars and students were maintained on the foundation; but it has now not above 1,400, and those are only taught to read and write. All the mosques are built upon the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, and differ only in magnitude. The entrance is through the principal gate into a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, open on the top, but well paved. Round this are covered galleries, supported by pillars; under which they say their prayers, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>. On one side of the square there are particular places with basins of water for the convenience of performing the ablutions enjoined by the Koran. The most remarkable part of the mosque, besides the minaret, is the dome. This is often bold, well proportioned, and of an astonishing magnitude. The inside <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> are carved like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LACE\">lace</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, and melons. They are built so firm, and with such art, that they will last 600 or 700 years. About the outward circumference there are large Arabic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSCRIPTIONS\">inscriptions</a> in relievo, which may be read by those who stand below, though they are sometimes of a wonderful height.\n\nThe khanes or caravanserais are numerous and large, with a court in the middle, like their housetops. Some are several stories high, and are always full of people and merchandise. The Nubians, the Abyssinians, and other African nations, which come to Cairo, have one to themselves, where they always meet with lodging. Here they are secure from insults, and their effects are all safe. Besides these there is a bazaar, or market, where all sorts of goods are to be sold. This is in a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> street; and yet the crowd is so great, you can hardly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> along. At the end of this street is another short one, but pretty broad, with shops full of the best sort of goods and precious merchandise. At the end of this short street there is a great khan, where all sorts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> slaves are to be sold. Farther than this is another khan, where a great number of blacks, of both sexes, are exposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>. Not far from the best market place is a mosque, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a> for mad people. They also receive and maintain sick people in this hospital, but they are poorly looked after.\n\nOld Cairo has scarce anything remarkable but the granaries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a>; which are nothing but a high wall, lately built, which includes a square spot of ground where they deposit wheat, barley, and other grain, which is a tribute to the batha, paid by the owners of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>. This has no other covering but the heavens, and therefore the birds are always sure to have their share. There is likewise a tolerably handsome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, which is made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPTS\">Copts</a>, who are Christians and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> inhabitants of Egypt. Joseph's\nJoseph's well is in the castle, and was made by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> Mohammed about 700 years ago. It is called Joseph's well, because they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> every thing extraordinary to that remarkable person. It is cut in a rock, and is 280 feet in depth. The water is drawn up to the top by means of oxen, placed on platforms, at proper distances, which turn about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> that raise it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> is so sloping, that, though there are no steps, the oxen can descend and ascend with ease.\n\nThe river Nile, to which not only Cairo, but all Egypt is so much indebted, is now known to have its rise in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABYSSINIA\">Abyssinia</a>. The increase of the Nile generally begins in May, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> proclaim about the city how much it is risen. Over against old Cairo the basin has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, wherein the water enters to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a>, which has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> at the distance of every inch, and marks at every two feet as far as 30. When the water rises to 22 feet, it is thought to be of a sufficient height; when it rises much higher, it does a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of mischief. There is much pomp and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> used in letting the water into the canal above mentioned. See Egypt.\n\nThe inhabitants of Cairo are a mixture of Moors, Turks, Jews, Greeks, and Copts or Coptis. The only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of the Moors and Copts is their turbans; those of the Moors being white, and of the Copts white striped with blue. The common people generally wear a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> loose frock, sewed together all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> before. The Jews wear a frock of the same fashion, made of cloth; and their caps are like a high-crowned hat, without brims, covered with the same cloth, but not so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAPER\">taper</a>. The Jewish women's are not very unlike the men's, but more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and long. The Greeks are habited like the Turks, only their turbans differ.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">Provisions</a> of all kinds are exceedingly plenty; for 20 eggs may be bought for a parah or penny, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> is six times as cheap as with us. They have almost all sorts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> and fish; and in particular have tame buffaloes, which are very useful. They bring goats into the streets in great numbers, to sell their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>. Their gardens are well stocked with fruit trees of various kinds, as well as roots, herbs, melons, and cucumbers. The most common flesh meat is mutton. The goats are very beautiful, and have ears two feet in length; but their flesh is in no great esteem.

At the bottom of this bay appear the ruins of two strong castles, the seat of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Caithness, called Castle Sinclair, and Gernego, joined to each other by a draw-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>. Duncan's bay, otherwise called Donkly-head, is the north-east point of Caithness, and the extremest promontory in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. At this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, the breadth of the frith does not exceed 12 miles, and in the neighbourhood is the ordinary ferry to the Orkneys. Here is likewise Clythenes pointing east, and Nohead pointing north-east. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> in this place is very impetuous, being in continual agitation from violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a>, currents, and vortices. The only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> belonging to this county is that of Stroma, in the Pentland frith, at the distance of two miles from the main <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, extending about a mile in length, and producing good corn. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> is here rendered very difficult by conflicting tides and currents, which at both ends of the island produce a great agitation in the sea. At the south end, the waves dance so impetuously, that the sailors <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> them the merry men of May, from the name of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>'s seat on the opposite shore of Caithness, which served them as a landmark, in the dangerous passage between the island and the continent. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of this island was once disputed between the earls of Orkney and Caithness; but adjudged to the latter, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of an experiment, by which it appeared, that venomous creatures <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> live in Stroma, whereas they die immediately <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> transported to the Orkneys. The county of Caithness, though chiefly mountainous, flattens towards the sea coast, where the ground is arable, and produces good harvests of oats and barley, sufficient for the natives, and yielding a surplus for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a>. Caithness is well watered with small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, brooks, lakes, and fountains, and affords a few woods of birch, but is in general bare of trees; and even those the inhabitants plant are stunted in their growth. Lead is found at Dunnet, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> at Old Uik, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> ore at several places; but these advantages are not improved. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of Caithness is temperate, though in the latitude of 58\u00b0, where the longest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> is computed at 18 hours; and when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> sets, he makes\nCaithness, so small an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of a circle below the horizon, that the people enjoy a twilight until he rises again. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> used by the inhabitants of Caithness consists of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEAT\">peat</a> and turf, which the ground yields in great plenty. The forests of Morravins and Berridale afford abundance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> deer and roe-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUCKS\">bucks</a>; the county is well stored with hares, rabbits, grouse, heathcocks, plover, and all sorts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAME\">game</a>, comprehending a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> called snow-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, about the size of a sparrow, exceedingly fat and delicious, that comes hither in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> flights about the middle of February, and takes its departure in April. The hills are covered with sheep and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> cattle; so numerous, that a fat cow has been sold at market for 4s. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>. The rocks along the coasts are frequented by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAGLES\">eagles</a>, hawks, and all manner of sea fowl, whose eggs and young are taken in vast quantities by the natives. The rivers and lakes abound with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TROUT\">trout</a>, salmon, and eels; and the sea affords a very advantageous fishery. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">Divers</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBELISKS\">obelisks</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> monuments appear in this district, and several Roman chapels are still standing. Caithness is well peopled with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of hardy inhabitants, who employ themselves chiefly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a>, and breeding sheep and black cattle: they are even remarkably industrious; for between Wick and Dunbeath, one continued tract of rugged rocks, extending 12 miles, they have forced several little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a> for their fishing boats, and cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> steps from the beach to the top of the rocks, where they have erected houses, in which they cure and dry the fish for market.\n\nAccording to Mr Pennant, this county is supposed to send out in some years about 20,000 head of black cattle, but in bad seasons the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> kills and sells great numbers for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>. Great numbers of swine are also reared here. They are short, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> backed, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> bridled, flaxen, slender, and long nosed; have long erect ears and most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> looks. Here are neither barns nor granaries: the corn is threshed out, and preserved in the chaff in byks; which are stacks, in the shape of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEE\">bee</a> hives, thatched quite round, where it will keep good for two years. Vast numbers of salmon are taken at Castle-hill, Wick, and Thurso. A miraculous draught at this last place is still talked of, not less than 2500 being taken at one tide within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; and Mr Smollet informs us, that, in the neighbourhood, above 300 good salmon have been taken at one draught of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of November, great numbers of seals are taken in the caverns that open into the sea, and run some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a> of yards underground. The entrance of these caverns is narrow, but the inside lofty and spacious. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a> hunters enter these in small boats with torches, which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> as soon as they land, and then with loud shouts alarm the animals, which they kill with clubs as they attempt to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>. This is a hazardous employment; for should the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> blow hard from sea, these adventurers are inevitably lost. Sometimes a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of seals, 12 feet long, have been killed on this coast; and it is said the same kind are found on the rock Hiskir, one of the Western <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>. During the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, great quantities of lump fish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> to this coast, and are the prey of the seals, as appears from the number of skins of those fishes which at that season float ashore. At certain times also the seals seem to be visited by a great mortality; for, at those times, multitudes of them are seen dead in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. Much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a> is found in this Caithness county, which when burnt is made into a compost with turf and sea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>.\n\nThe discovery of coal has long been an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of great importance in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Scotland. In the years 1801 and 1802 some attempts were made for this purpose at the expense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. But although the business was conducted by persons well skilled in such matters, and long persevered in, it has entirely failed, which leaves little hope of future success.\n\nThe following is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of the county of Caithness according to the parishes, taken at two different periods, namely in 1755 and in 1798, and extracted from the Statistical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of Scotland.\n\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">Parish</a> | Population in 1755 | Population in 1798-1799 |\n|--------|------------------|------------------------|\n| Bower  | 1287             | 1592                   |\n| Canisbay | 1481            | 1950                   |\n| Dunnet  | 1235             | 1399                   |\n| Halkirk | 3075             | 3180                   |\n| Latheron | 3675            | 4006                   |\n| Olrick  | 875              | 1001                   |\n| Reay    | 2262             | 2298                   |\n| Thurso  | 2963             | 3146                   |\n| Wattin  | 1424             | 1230                   |\n| Wick    | 3938             | 5000                   |\n\n22,215 24,802","sp":63,"ep":64},{"h":"CAIUS","t":"KAYE, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> KEYE, Dr John, the founder of Caius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWICH\">Norwich</a> in 1510.

Of this college he accepted the mastership, which he kept till within a short time of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. He was physician to Edward VI.

It was afterwards remembered that an unusual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> had affected the skins of several persons <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> before the shock; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> assumed a muddy ash-coloured tinge, and a sulphurous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> was almost general. A frigate passing between Calabria and Lipari felt so severe a shock, that the steersman was thrown from the helm, and the cannons were raised upon their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a>, while all around the sea exhaled a strong smell of brimstone.\n\nStupendous alterations were occasioned in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the country; rivers choked up by the falling in of the hills, were converted into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not speedily drained by some future convulsion, or opened by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> labour, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> fill the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> with pestilential vapours, and destroy the remnants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>. Whole acres of ground, with housetops and trees upon them, were broken off from the plains, and washed many furlongs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the deep hollows which the course of the rivers had worn; there, to the astonishment and terror of beholders, they found a new foundation to fix upon, either in an upright or an inclining position. In short, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of phenomenon, incident to these destructive commotions of the earth, was to be seen in its utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> and variety in this desolated country. Their Sicilian majesties, with the utmost expedition, despatched\nspatched vessels loaded with every thing that could be thought of on the occasion for the relief and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> of the distressed Calabrians; a general officer went from Naples with engineers and troops to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the operations of the persons employed in clearing away and rebuilding the houses, and to defend the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the sufferers. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> ordered this officer to take all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> treasuries could supply or borrow; for, rather than it should be wanting on this pressing call, he was determined to part with his plate, nay the very furniture of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>. A messenger sent off from a town near Reggio, on the 8th of February, travelled four days without shelter, and without being able to procure a morsel of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>; he supported <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> with a piece of cheese which he had brought in his pocket, and the vegetables he was lucky enough to find near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>. To add to all their other sufferings, the Calabrians found themselves and the miserable wreck of their fortunes exposed to the depredations of robbers and pirates. Villains landed from boats and plundered several places, and thieves went even from Naples in search of booty: In order to strike a greater terror, they dressed themselves like Algerines; but were discovered and driven off. To this accumulated distress succeeded a most inclement season, which obstructed every effort made to alleviate it; and almost daily earthquakes kept the inhabitants in continual dread, not of being destroyed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of houses, for none were left, but of being swallowed up by the splitting of the earth, or buried in the waves by some sudden inundation.\n\nFor further particulars concerning this dreadful catastrophe, and the phenomena attending it, see Earthquake.","sp":65,"ep":66},{"h":"CALADE","t":"in the manege, the decent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> flopping declivity of a rising manege ground, being a small eminence upon which we ride <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> several times, putting him to a short gallop, with his fore hams in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, to learn him to ply or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> his haunches, and form his stop upon the aides of the calves of the legs, the stay of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDLE\">bridle</a>, and the cavelon fealona- bly given.","sp":66,"ep":66},{"h":"CALAGORINA","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Calaguris, distinguished by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURNAME\">surname</a> Nafica, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">Ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of the Valcenes in the Hither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>: now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALAHORRA\">Calahorra</a>.","sp":66,"ep":66},{"h":"CALAHORRA","t":"an episcopal town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, in Old Castile, seated on a fertile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, on the side of a hill which extends to the banks of the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EBRO\">Ebro</a>.

The citadel is as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> as the town, and has but one entrance. It is a trading <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, with handsome streets, and several churches and monasteries; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of inhabitants is reckoned to be 4000.\n\nCalais was taken by Edward III. in 1347. Hither he marched his victorious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> from Creully, and invested the town on the 8th of September. But finding that it could not be taken by force without the destruction of great multitudes of his men, he turned the siege into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCKADE\">blockade</a>; and having made strong intrenchments to secure his army from the enemy, huts Calais, to protect them from the inclemency of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, and stationed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> before the harbour to prevent the introduction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, he resolved to wait with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> till the place fell into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> by famine. The besieged, discovering his intention, turned seventeen hundred women, children, and old people, out of the town, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> their provisions; and Edward had the goodness, after entertaining them with a dinner, and giving them two-pence a piece, to suffer them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>. The garrison and inhabitants of Calais having at length consumed all their provisions, and even eaten all the horses, dogs, cats, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMIN\">vermin</a> in the place, the governor John de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VIENNE\">Vienne</a> appeared upon the walls, and offered to capitulate. Edward greatly incensed at their obstinate resistance, which had detained him eleven months under their walls, at an immense expense both of men and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, sent Sir Walter Mauny, an illustrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a>, to acquaint the governor that he would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> terms; but that they must surrender at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a>. At length, however, at the spirited remonstrances of the governor, and the persuasions of Sir Walter Mauny, Edward consented to grant their lives to all the garrison and inhabitants, except six of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> burgesses, who should deliver to him the keys of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a> about their necks. When these terms were made known to the people of Calais, they were plunged into the deepest distress; and after all the miseries they had suffered, they could not think without horror of giving up six of their fellow citizens to certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. In this extremity, when the whole people were drowned in tears, and uncertain what to do, Euiface de St Pierre, one of the richest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> in the place, stepped forth, and voluntarily offered himself to be one of these six devoted victims. His noble example was soon imitated by other five of the most wealthy citizens. These true patriots, barefooted, and bareheaded, with ropes about their necks, were attended to the gates by the whole inhabitants, with tears, bleatings, and prayers for their safety. When they were brought into Edward's presence, they laid the keys of the city at his feet, and falling on their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a> implored his mercy in such moving strains, that all the noble spectators melted into tears. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s resentment was so strong for the many toils and losses he had suffered in this tedious siege, that he was in some danger of forgetting his usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>; when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>, falling upon her knees before him, earnestly begged and obtained their lives. This great and good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> conducted these virtuous citizens, whose lives she had saved, to her own apartment, entertained them honourably, and dismissed them with presents. Edward took possession of Calais August 4th; and in order to secure a conquest of so great importance, and which had cost him so dear, he found it necessary to turn out all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> inhabitants, who had discovered so strong an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to their native prince, and to people it with English.\n\nCalais remained in subjection to England till the reign of Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, when it was retaken by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Guise. This general began the enterprise by ordering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIVATEERS\">privateers</a> of Normandy and Bretagne to cruise in the Channel, more especially in the very straits of Calais: he then detached the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEVERS\">Nevers</a> with\na considerable army towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> of Luxembourg; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> which drew the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the Spaniards that way: when all things were ready, he procured an application from the people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOULOGNE\">Boulogne</a>, for a body of troops to secure them against the incursions of the Spaniards; he sent a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> at their request, which was followed by another, under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of supporting them; then repaired thither in person, secure that his officers would follow his instructions: and thus, on the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of the new year, 1557, Calais was invested. He immediately attacked Fort St Agatha, which the garrison quitted, and retired into the fort of Nicola\u00ef, which, together with the Ribank, the besiegers attacked at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, granted good terms to the officer who commanded in the former, but obliged the garrison of the latter to surrender prisoners of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>. By these means he opened a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with the sea; and having received from on board the ships an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of hurdles, his infantry, by the help of them, paved the morasses that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> round the town. He then made a false attack at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>-gate, which drew the attention of the garrison, who fatigued themselves exceedingly in making intrenchments behind the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a>; but when they had finished their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, he began to fire upon the castle, where the walls were very old, and had been neglected on account of the breadth of the ditch, which was also very deep when the tide was in; but a great breach being made, the duke caused it to be attacked in the night, and during the ebb, the foldiers passing almost up to the shoulders. The place was easily carried, though the governor made three vigorous attacks before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> of day, in order to dislodge them; but the French, though they lost a considerable number of men, kept their posts. The governor then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> that it was impracticable to defend the place any longer, and therefore made the best terms for himself that he could obtain, which, however, were not very good: and thus in eight days the duke of Guise recovered a fortress which cost the victorious Edward III. a whole year's siege, and which had been now 210 years in the possession of the English, without so much as a single attempt to retake it.\n\nThere are very different accounts given of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>. Some English historians say, that King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> penetrated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of the French upon this fortress, gave notice of it in England, and offered to take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of it upon himself; but that this, out of jealousy, was refused, it being believed to be only an artifice to get a place of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> into his own hands. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of the matter seems to be this: The strength of Calais consisted in its situation and outworks, which required a very numerous garrison; but this being attended with a very large expense, the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the troops had been sent to join Philip's army, so that the governor had not above 500 men, and there were no more than 250 of the townsmen able to bear arms. As to ammunition, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>, and provisions, the French found there abundance; but with so slender a garrison, it was impossible to make a better defence; and therefore when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Wentworth, who was governor, and whom the French call Lord Dumfort, was tried by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEERS\">peers</a> for the loss of this place, he was acquitted. The duke obliged all the English inhabitants to quit Calais; and befellowed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of it upon Des Termes, who was soon after made a marshal of France.\n\nThe fortifications of Calais are good; but its greatest strength is its situation among the marshes, which may be overflowed at the approach of an enemy. The harbour is not so good as formerly, nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> it admit vessels of any great burden. In times of peace, there are packet boats going backward and forward twice a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a> to Calais, which is 21 miles distant.\n\nE. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">Long</a>. 2. 6.

The calamine of England, however, is by the best judges allowed to be superior in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> to that of most other countries. It seldom lies very deep, being chiefly found in clayey grounds near the surface. In some places it is mixed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> ores. It is a true ore of zinc, and is used as an ingredient in making of bras.\u2014Newman relates various experiments with this mineral, the only result of which was to show that it contained iron as well as zinc. The most remarkable are the following: A saturated solution of calamine in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> acid, concentrated by evaporating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the liquor, exhibits in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> an appearance of fine crystals, which on the application of warmth dissolve and disappear. A little of this concentrated solution tinges a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> of a bright yellow colour; and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> deposits by degrees a fine, spongy, brownish precipitate. Blue dissolved in this solution, and afterwards inspissated, forms an extremely slippery tenacious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, which does not become dry, and, were it not too expensive, might be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> for entangling flies, caterpillars, &c. Sulphur boiled in this solution, seems to acquire some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of transparency.\ntransparency.\u2014This mineral is an article in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MATERIA_MEDICA\">materia medica</a>; but, before it comes to the shops is usually roasted or calcined, in order to separate some arsenical or sulphurous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> which is in its crude state it is supposed to contain, and to render it more easily reducible into a fine powder. In this state it is employed in collyria against defluxions of thin acrid humours upon the eyes, for drying up moist running ulcers, and healing excoriations. It is the basis of an official epulotic Cerate.\n\nThere is another substance from which this semi-metal is also obtained. This is called cadmia furnacum, or cadmia of the furnaces, to distinguish it from the other. This is a matter sublimed when ores containing zinc, like those of Rammelberg, are melted. This cadmia consists of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> of the semi-metal sublimed during the fusion, and adhering to the inner surfaces of the walls of furnaces, where they suffer a semi-fusion, and therefore acquire some solidity. So great a quantity of these is collected, that they form very thick incrustations, which must be frequently taken off.\n\nCALAMINT.

These calculi were made of thin wood, polished and covered over with wax. Their form is still seen in some medals of the Caecilian family; and the manner of casting them into the urns, in the medals of the Licinian family. The letters marked upon these calculi were U. R. for uti rogas, and A. for antiquo; the first of which expressed an approbation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, the latter a rejection of it.

Thus there is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENTIAL\">Differential</a> calculus, the Exponential, the Integral, the Literal, and the Antecedential.\n\nCalculus Differentialis, is a method of differencing quantities, or of finding an infinitely small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, which being taken infinite times, shall be equal to a given quantity; or, it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a> of the infinitely small differences of variable quantities.\n\nThe foundation of this calculus is an infinitely small quantity, or an infinitesimal, which is a portion of a quantity incomparable to that quantity, or that is less than any assignable one, and therefore accounted as nothing; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> accruing by omitting it being less than any assignable one. Hence two quantities, only differing by an infinitesimal, are reputed equal. Thus, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, the diameter of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> is an infinitesimal, in respect of the distance of the fixed stars; and the same holds in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> quantities. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, infinitesimal, therefore, is merely relative, and involves a relation to another quantity; and does not denote any real ens or being. Now infinitesimals are called differentials, or differential quantities, when they are considered as the differences of two quantities. Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton calls them moments; considering them as the momentary increments of quantities, e.g., of a line <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a> of a point, or of a surface by the flux of a line. The differential calculus, therefore, and the doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUXIONS\">fluxions</a>, are the same thing under different names; the former given by M. Leibnitz, and the latter by Sir Isaac Newton: each of whom lays claim to the discovery. There is, indeed, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of expressing the quantities resulting from the different views wherein the two authors consider the infinitesimals: the one as moments, the other as differences. Leibnitz, and most foreigners, express the differentials of quantities by the same letters as variable ones, only prefixing the letter \\(d\\): thus the differential of \\(x\\) is called \\(dx\\); and that of \\(y\\), \\(dy\\); now \\(dx\\) is a positive quantity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> \\(x\\) continually increase; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>, if it decrease. The English, with Sir Isaac Newton,\nCalculus. Newton, instead of \\( dx \\) write \\( x \\) (with a dot over it), for \\( dy \\), \\( y \\), &c., which foreigners <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> against, on account of that confusion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, which they imagine arises when differentials are again differenced; besides, that the printers are more apt to overlook a point than a letter. Stable quantities being always expressed by the first letters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a> \\( d^a = o \\), \\( d^b = o \\), \\( d^c = o \\); therefore \\( d(x+y-a) = dx + dy \\), and \\( d(x-y+a) = dx - dy \\). So that the differencing of quantities is easily performed by the addition or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUBTRACTION\">subtraction</a> of their compounds.\n\nTo difference quantities that multiply each other; the rule is, first, multiply the differential of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTOR\">factor</a> into the other factor, the sum of the two factors is the differential sought: thus, the quantities being \\( x \\), \\( y \\), the differential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be \\( x \\cdot dy + y \\cdot dx \\), i.e. \\( d(xy) = xy \\cdot dx + y \\cdot dx \\).\n\nSecondly, If there be three quantities mutually multiplying each other, the factum of the two must then be multiplied into the differential of the third; thus suppose \\( vxy \\), let \\( vx = t \\), then \\( vx \\cdot y = ty \\); consequently \\( d(vxy) = tdxy + y \\cdot dt \\); but \\( dt = 0 \\cdot dx + x \\cdot dv \\).\n\nThese values, therefore, being substituted in the antecedent differential, \\( tdxy + y \\cdot dt \\), the result is, \\( d(vxy) = v \\cdot dx + v \\cdot dy + x \\cdot dv \\). Hence it is easy to apprehend how to proceed, where the quantities are more than three. If one variable quantity increase, while the other decreases, it is evident \\( y \\cdot dx - x \\cdot dy \\) will be the differential of \\( xy \\).\n\nTo difference quantities that mutually divide each other; the rule is, first, multiply the differential of the divisor into the dividend; and on the contrary, the differential of the dividend into the divisor; subtract the last product from the first, and divide the remainder by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the divisor; the quotient is the differential of the quantities mutually dividing each other. See Fluxions.\n\nCalculus Exponentialis, is a method of differencing exponential quantities, or of finding and summing up the differentials or moments of exponential quantities; or at least bringing them to geometrical constructions.\n\nBy exponential quantity, is here understood a power, whose exponent is variable; e.g. \\( x^a \\), \\( a^x \\), \\( x^7 \\), where the exponent \\( x \\) does not denote the same in all the points of a curve, but in some stands for 2, in others for 3, in others for 5, &c.\n\nTo difference an exponential quantity; there is nothing required but to reduce the exponential quantities to logarithmic ones; which done, the differencing is managed as in logarithmic quantities.\u2014Thus, suppose the differential of the exponential quantity \\( x^y \\) required, let\n\n\\[\nx^y = z\n\\]\n\nThen will \\( y \\cdot dx = dz \\)\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} \\cdot dy + \\frac{y}{x} \\cdot dx = \\frac{dz}{z}\n\\]\n\nThat is, \\( x^y \\cdot dy + y \\cdot x^{y-1} \\cdot dx = dz \\).\n\nCalculus Integralis, or Summatorius, is a method of integrating, or summing up moments, or differential quantities; i.e. from a differential quantity given, to find the quantity from whose differencing the given differential results.\n\nThe integral calculus, therefore, is the inverse of the differential one; whence the English, who usually call the differential method fluxions, give this calculus, which ascends from the fluxions, to the flowing or variable quantities; or as foreigners express it, from the differences to the sums, by the name of the inverse method of fluxions.\n\nHence, the integration is known to be justly performed, if the quantity found, according to the rules of the differential calculus, being differenced, produce that proposed to be summed.\n\nSuppose \\( f \\) the sign of the sum, or integral quantity, then \\( f(y \\cdot dx) \\) will denote the sum, or integral of the differential \\( y \\cdot dx \\).\n\nTo integrate, or sum up a differential quantity: it is demonstrated, first, that \\( f(x) = x \\); secondly, \\( f(d(x+dy)) = x + y \\); thirdly, \\( f(x \\cdot dy + y \\cdot dx) = x \\cdot y \\); fourthly, \\( f(m \\cdot x^m \\cdot dx) = x^m : \\) fifthly, \\( f(n \\cdot m \\cdot x^m \\cdot dx) = \\frac{x^n}{m} \\);\n\nSixthly, \\( f(y \\cdot dx - x \\cdot dy) : y^2 = x \\cdot y \\). Of these, the fourth and fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> are the most frequent, wherein the differential quantity is integrated, by adding a variable unity to the exponent, and dividing the sum by the new exponent multiplied into the differential of the root; v.g. the fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, by \\( m - (i + 1) \\cdot dx \\), i.e. by \\( m \\cdot dx \\).\n\nIf the differential quantity to be integrated doth not come under any of these formulas, it must either be reduced to an integral finite, or an infinite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a>, each of whose terms may be summed.\n\nIt may be here observed, that, as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of finites, any quantity may be raised to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of power; but vice versa, the root cannot be extracted out of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> required; so in the analysis of infinites, any variable or flowing quantity may be differenced; but vice versa, any differential cannot be integrated. And as, in the analysis of finites, we are not yet arrived at a method of extracting the roots of all equations, so neither has the integral calculus arrived at its perfection: and as in the former we are obliged to have recourse to approximation, so in the latter we have recourse to infinite series, where we cannot attain to a perfect integration.\n\nCalculus Literalis, or Literal Calculus, is the same with specious arithmetic, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALGEBRA\">algebra</a>, so called from its using the letters of the alphabet; in contradistinction to numeral arithmetic, which uses figures. In the literal calculus given quantities are expressed by the first letters, \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\), \\( d \\); and quantities sought by the last \\( y \\), \\( z \\), &c. Equal quantities are denoted by the same letters.\n\nCalculus, Antecedental, a geometrical method of reasoning invented by Mr Glenie, which, without any consideration of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> or velocity, is applicable to all the purposes of fluxions. In this method, says Mr Glenie, \"every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> is truly and strictly geometrical, is founded on principles frequently made use of by the ancient geometers, principles admitted into the very first elements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, and repeatedly used by Euclid himself. As it is a branch of general geometrical proportion, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>, and is derived from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the antecedents of ratios, hav-\nCalculating given consequents and a given standard of comparison in various degrees of augmentation and diminution they undergo by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> and decomposition, I have called it the antecedental calculus. As it is purely geometrical, and perfectly scientific, I have since its first occurrence to me in 1779, always made use of it instead of the fluxionary and differential calculi, which are merely arithmetical. Its principles are totally unconnected with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of motion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, which, strictly speaking, are foreign to pure geometry and abstract science, though, in mixed mathematics and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> philosophy, they are equally applicable to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, involving the consideration of either with the two numerical methods <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned. And as many such investigations require compositions and decompositions of ratios, extending greatly beyond the triplicate and subtriplicate, this calculus in all of them furnishes every expression in a strictly geometrical form. The standards of comparison in it may be any magnitudes whatever, and are of course indefinite and innumerable; and the consequents of the ratios, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> or decompounded, may be either equal or unequal, homogeneous or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a>. In the fluxionary and differential methods, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, 1, or unit, is not only the standard of comparison, but also the consequent of every ratio compounded or decompounded.\" See Phil. Trans. Edin. vol. iv.\n\nSome mathematicians, however, are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that the advantage to be derived from the employment of this calculus is not so great as the author seems to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> from it.\n\n**Calculus Minerve**, among the ancient lawyers, denoted the decision of a cause, wherein the judges were equally divided.

His experiment succeeded, both with that and some other calculi; from which he conjectures, that hard waters which contain calcareous earth may contribute towards the formation of these calculi.\n\n**Calcutta**, the capital of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a>, and of all the British possessions in the East Indies, is situated on the river Huguley, a branch of the Ganges, about 100 miles from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, in N. Lat. 23\u00b0 and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">Long</a>. 88\u00b0 28' E. from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a>. It is but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, built on the site of a village called Gouripur. The English first obtained the Mogul's permission to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the year 1692; and Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOB\">Job</a> Charnock, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>, made choice of the spot on which the city stands, on account of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> shady <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROVE\">grove</a> which grew there; though in other respects it was the worst he could have pitched upon; for three miles to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> lake, which overflows in September, and when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a> retires in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>, leaves behind such a quantity of fish and other putrefied matter, as renders the air very unhealthy. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of the Gentoos throwing the dead bodies of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> people into the river is also very disagreeable, and undoubtedly contributes to render the place unhealthy, as well as the cause already mentioned.\n\nCalcutta is now become a large and populous city, being supposed at present to contain 500,000 inhabitants. It is elegantly built, at least the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> inhabited by the English; but the rest, and that the greatest part, is built after the fashion of the cities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> in general. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of all these is nearly the same; their streets are exceedingly confined, narrow, and crooked, with a vast number of ponds, reservoirs, and gardens interspersed. A few of the streets are paved with brick. The houses are built, some with brick, others with mud, and a still greater number with bamboos and mats; all which different kinds of fabrics standing intermixed with one another, form a very uncouth appearance. The brick houses are seldom above two stories <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, but those of mud and bamboos are only one, and are covered with thatch. The roofs of the brick houses are flat and terraced. These, however, are much fewer in number than the other two kinds; so that fires, which often happen, do not sometimes meet with a brick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> to obstruct their progress in a whole street. Within these 20 or 25 years Calcutta has been greatly improved both in appearance and in the salubrity of its air: the streets have been properly drained, and the ponds filled; thereby removing a vast surface of stagnant water, the exhalations of which were particularly hurtful. The citadel is named Fort William, and is superior as a fortress to any in India; but is now on too extensive a scale to answer the purpose for which it was intended, viz. the holding a post in case of extremity. It was begun on this extended plan by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Clive immediately after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASSEY\">Plassey</a>. The expense attending it was supposed to amount to two millions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>.\n\nCalcutta is the emporium of Bengal, and the residence\ndence of the governor general of India. Its flourishing state may in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> be supposed owing to the unlimited toleration of all religions allowed here; the Pagans being suffered to carry their idols in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESSION\">procession</a>, the Mahomedans not being discomfited, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMAN_CATHOLICS\">Roman Catholics</a> being allowed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>.\n\nAt about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>'s distance from the town is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> where the natives annually undergo a very strange kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENANCE\">penance</a> on the 9th of April; some for the sins they have committed, others for those they may commit, and others in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOW\">vow</a> made by their parents. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> is performed in the following manner: Thirty bamboos, each about the height of 20 feet, are erected in the plain above-mentioned. On the top of these they contrive to fix a swivel, and another bamboo of thirty feet or more crosses it, at each end of which hangs a rope. The people pull <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> one end of this rope, and the devotee placing himself under it, the brahmin pinches up a large piece of skin under both the shoulderblades, sometimes in the breasts, and thrusts a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> hook through each. These hooks have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> garlands hanging to them, which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> makes fast to the rope at the end of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> bamboo, and at the same time puts a fish round the body of the devotee, laying it loyally in the hollow of the hooks, left by the skin's giving way, he should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to the ground. When this is done, the people haul down the other end of the bamboo; by which means the devotee is immediately lifted up 30 feet or more from the ground, and they run round as fast as their legs can carry them. Thus the devotee is thrown out the whole length of the rope, where, as he swings, he plays a thousand antic tricks; being painted and dressed in a very particular manner, on purpose to make him look more ridiculous. Some of them continue swinging half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, others less. The devotees undergo a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of four days for this ceremony. On the first and third they abstain from all kinds of food; but eat fruit on the other two. During this time of preparation they walk about the streets in their fantastic dresses, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> of drums and horns; and some to express the greater ardour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>, run a rod of iron quite through their tongues, and sometimes through their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a> also.\n\nBefore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> of 1755, Calcutta was commonly garrisoned by 300 Europeans, who were frequently employed in conveying the company's vessels from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATNA\">Patna</a>, loaded with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALTPETRE\">saltpetre</a>, piece goods, opium, and raw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>. The trade of Bengal alone supplied rich cargoes for 50 or 60 ships annually, besides what was carried on in small vessels to the adjacent countries. It was this flourishing state of Calcutta that probably was one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> for the nabob Surajah Dowlah to attack it in the year 1756. Having had the fort of Cossimbazar delivered up to him, he marched against Calcutta with all his forces, amounting to 70,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> and foot, with 400 elephants, and invested the place on the 15th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>. Previous to any hostilities, however, he wrote a letter to Mr Drake the governor, offering to withdraw his troops, on condition that he would pay him his duty on the trade for 15 years past, defray the expense of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, and deliver up the black <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> who were in the fort. This being refused, he attacked one of the redoubts at the entrance of the town; but was repulsed with great slaughter. On the 16th he attacked another advanced post, but was likewise repulsed with great loss. Notwithstanding this disappointment, however, the attempt was renewed on the 18th, when the troops abandoned these posts, and retreated into the fort; on which the nabob's troops entered the town, and plundered it for 24 hours. An order was then given for attacking the fort; for which purpose a small breastwork was thrown up, and two twelve-pounders mounted upon it; but without firing oftener than two or three times an hour. The governor then called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of war, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a> of the train informed them, that there was not ammunition in the fort to serve three days; in consequence of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> ladies were sent on board the ships lying before the fort. They were followed by the governor, who declared himself a Quaker, and left the place to be defended by Mr Holwell the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> in council. Besides the governor, four of the council, eight gentlemen of the company's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, four officers, and 100 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, with 52 free merchants, captains of ships, and other gentlemen, escaped on board the ships, where were also 59 ladies, with 33 of their children. The whole number left in the fort was about 250 effective men, with Mr Holwell, four captains, five lieutenants, six ensigns, and five sergeants; as also 14 sea captains, and 29 gentlemen of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTORY\">factory</a>. Mr Holwell then having held a council of war, divided three chests of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> among the discontented soldiers, making them large promises also, if they behaved with courage and fidelity; after which he boldly stood on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the place, notwithstanding the immense force which opposed him. The attack was very vigorous; the enemy having got possession of the houses, called the English from thence, and drove them from the battions; but they themselves were several times dislodged by the fire from the fort, which killed an incredible number, with the loss of only five English soldiers the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. The attack, however, was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till the afternoon of the 20th; when many of the garrison being killed and wounded, and their ammunition almost exhausted, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a> of truce was hung out. Mr Holwell intended to have availed himself of this opportunity to make his escape on board the ships, but they had fallen several miles down from the fort, without leaving even a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> to facilitate the escape of those who remained. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, however, the back-gate was betrayed by the Dutch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a>, and the enemy, entering the fort, killed all they first met, and took the rest prisoners.\n\nThe fort was taken before six in the evening; and, in an hour after, Mr Holwell had three audiences of the nabob, the last being in the durbar or council. In all of these the governor had the most positive assurances that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> harm should happen to any of the prisoners; but he was surprized and enraged at finding only 500l. in the fort, instead of the immense treasures he expected; and to this as well as perhaps to the resentment of the jemidaars or officers, of whom many were killed in the siege, we may impute the catastrophe that followed.\n\nAs soon as it was dark, the English prisoners, to the number of 146, were directed by the jemidaars who guarded them, to collect themselves into one body, and sit down quietly under the arched veranda,\nBesides the guard over them, another was placed at the south end of this veranda, to prevent the escape of any of them. About 500 gunmen, with lighted matches, were drawn up on the parade; and soon after the factory was in flames to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and left of the prisoners, who had various conjectures on this appearance. The fire advanced with rapidity on both sides; and it was the prevailing opinion of the English, that they were to be suffocated between the two fires. On this they soon came to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of rushing on the guard, seizing their scimitars, and attacking the troops upon the parade, rather than be thus tamely roasted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>: but Mr Holwell advanced, and found the Moors were only searching for a place to confine them in. At the time Mr Holwell might have made his escape, by the affluence of Mr Leech, the company's smith, who had escaped when the Moors entered the fort, and returned just as it was dark, to tell Mr Holwell he had provided a boat, and would ensure his escape, if he would follow him through a passage few were acquainted with, and by which he then entered. This might easily have been accomplished, as the guard took little notice of it; but Mr Holwell told Mr Leech, he was resolved to share the fate of the gentlemen and the garrison; to which Mr Leech gallantly replied, that \"then he was resolved to share Mr Holwell's fate, and would not leave him.\"\n\nThe guard on the parade advanced, and ordered them all to rise and go into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRACKS\">barracks</a>. Then, with their muskets presented, they ordered them to go into the Black Hole prison; while others, with clubs and scimitars, pressed upon them so strong, that there was no resisting it; but, like an agitated wave impelling another, they were obliged to give way and enter; the rest following like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a>. Few among them, the foldiers excepted, had the least idea of the dimensions or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of a place they had never seen; for if they had, they should at all events have rushed upon the guard, and been cut to pieces by their own choice as the lesser evil.\n\nIt was about eight o'clock when these 146 unhappy persons, exhausted by continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> and fatigue, were thus crammed together into a dungeon about eighteen feet square, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>, filthy night in Bengal; shut up to the east and south, the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> from whence air could reach them, by dead walls, and by a wall and door to the north; open only to the west by two windows, strongly barred with iron, from which they could receive scarce any circulation of fresh air.\n\nThey had been but few minutes confined before every one fell into a perspiration so profuse, that no idea can be formed of it. This brought on a raging thirst, which increased in proportion as the body was drained of its moisture. Various expedients were thought of to give more room and air. Every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> was stripped, and every hat put in motion; they several times sat down on their hams; but at each time several of the poor creatures fell, and were instantly suffocated or trode to death.\n\nBefore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> o'clock every man's thirst grew intolerable, and respiration difficult. Efforts were again made to force the door; but still in vain. Many insults were used to the guards, to provoke them to fire in upon the prisoners, who grew outrageous, and many delirious. \"Water, water,\" became the general cry. Some water was brought; but these supplies, like sprinkling water on fire, only served to raise and feed the flames. The confusion became general and horrid from the cries and ravings for water; and some were trampled to death. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of misery proved entertainment to the brutal wretches without, who supplied them with water, that they might have the satisfaction of seeing them fight for it, as they phrased it; and held up lights to the bars, that they might lose no part of the inhuman diversion.\n\nBefore eleven o'clock, most of the gentlemen were dead, and one-third of the whole. Thirst grew intolerable; but Mr Holwell kept his mouth moist by sucking the perspiration out of his shirt sleeves, and catching the drops as they fell, like heavy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>. By half an hour after eleven, most of the living were in an outrageous delirium. They found that water heightened their uneasiness; and \"Air, air\" was the general cry. Every insult that could be devised against the guard; all the opprobrious names that the viceroy and his officers could be loaded with, were repeated, to provoke the guard to fire upon them. Every man had eager hopes of meeting the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a>. Then a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, to hasten the approach of the flames to the right and left of them, and put a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> to their misery. Some expired on others; while a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a> arose as well from the living as the dead, which was very offensive.\n\nAbout two in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, they crowded so much to the windows, that many died standing, unable to fall by the throng and equal pressure round. When the day broke, the stench arising from the dead bodies was insufferable. At that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a>, the fouubah, who had received an account of the havoc death had made among them, sent one of his officers to inquire if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> survived. Mr Holwell was shown to him; and near six, an order came for their release.\n\nThus they had remained in this infernal prison from eight at night until six in the morning, when the poor remains of 146 souls, being only 23, came out alive; but most of them in a high putrid fever. The dead bodies were dragged out of the hole by the foldiers, and thrown promiscuously into the ditch of an unfinished ravelin, which was afterwards filled with earth.\n\nThe injuries which Calcutta suffered at this time, however, were soon repaired. The place was retaken by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMIRAL\">Admiral</a> Watson and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> Clive, early in 1757; Surajah Dowla was defeated, depopulated, and put to death; and Meer Jaffier, who succeeded him in the nabobship, engaged to pay an immense sum for the indemnification of the inhabitants. Since that time, the immense acquisition of territory by the British in this part of the world, with the constant state of security enjoyed by this city, have given an opportunity of embellishing and improving it greatly beyond what it was before.\u2014Among these improvements we may reckon that of Sir William Jones, who, on the 15th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1784, instituted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> for inquiring into the history civil and natural, the antiquities, arts, sciences, and literature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>; and thus the literature","sp":71,"ep":75},{"h":"CALDARIUM","t":"in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a>, denoted a brazen vessel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> cistern, placed in the hypocaustum, full of hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, to be drawn thence into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PISCINA\">piscina</a> or bath, to give it the necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>.

This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> was very warmly opposed by many of the ministers, and particularly by Mr David Calderwood; who, when Mr James <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">Law</a>, bishop of Orkney, came to visit the presbyteries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-MERSE\">Merse</a> and Tiviotdale, declined his jurisdiction by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> under his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> dated May 5, 1608. But the king having its success much at heart, sent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUNBAR\">Dunbar</a>, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a> of Scotland, with Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABBOT\">Abbot</a>, afterward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTERBURY\">Canterbury</a>, and two other divines, into that kingdom, with instructions to employ every method to persuade both the clergy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAITY\">laity</a> of his majesty's sincere desire to promote the good of the church, and of his zeal for the Protestant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>.

At that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the clergy met in one of the churches, to hear and advise with the bishops, which kind of assembly, it seems, was contrived in order to resemble the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVOCATION\">convocation</a>. Mr Calderwood was present at it, but declared publicly that he did not take any such meetings to resemble a convocation; and being opposed by Dr Whitford and Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a>, who were friends to the bishops, he took his leave of them in these words: \"It is absurd to see men sitting in silks and satins, and to cry poverty in the kirk, when purity is departing.\" The parliament proceeded in the meanwhile in the despatch of business; and Mr Calderwood, with several other ministers, being informed that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> was depending to empower the king, with the advice of the archbishops, bishops, and such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the ministry as his majesty should think proper, to confer and conclude, as to matters decent for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> policy of the church, not repugnant to the word of God; and that such conclusions should have the strength and power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> laws; against this they protested, for four reasons.\n\n1. Because their church was so perfect, that, instead of needing reformation, it might be a pattern to others.\n\n2. General assemblies, as now established by law, and which ought always to continue, might by this means be overthrown.\n\n3. Because it might be a means of creating schism, and disturb the tranquillity of the church.\n\n4. Because they had received assurances, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> attempts should be made to bring them to a conformity with the church of England. They desired therefore, that, for these and other reasons, all thoughts of passing such a law might be laid aside: but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> this be not done, they protest for themselves and their brethren who shall adhere to them, that they can yield no obedience to this law, when it shall be enacted, because it is destructive of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of the church; and therefore shall submit to such penalties, and think themselves obliged to undergo such punishments, as may be inflicted on them for disobeying that law. This protest was signed by Mr Archibald Simson on behalf of the members, who subscribed another separate roll, which he kept for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTIFICATION\">justification</a>. This protest was presented to the clerk <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a>, who refused to read it before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> in parliament. However, though not read, it had its effect; for although the bill had the consent of parliament, yet the king thought fit to cause it to be laid aside, and not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> after called a general assembly at St Andrew's. Soon after the parliament was dissolved, and Mr Calderwood was summoned to appear before the high-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> at St Andrew's, on the 8th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> following, to answer for his mutinous and seditious behaviour. July 10th, the king came to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> in person; when Mr Calderwood, being called upon, and refusing to comply with what the king in person required of him, was committed to prison. Afterwards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-PRIVY_COUNCIL\">privy <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, according to the power exercised by them at that time, directed him to banish himself out of the king's dominions before Michaelmas next; and not to return without license. Having applied to the king for a prorogation of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> without success, because he would neither acknowledge his offence, nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> conformity for the future, he retired to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, where, in 1623, he published his celebrated piece entitled Altare Damascenum. Mr Calderwood having in the year 1624 been afflicted with a long fit of sickness, and nothing having been heard of him for some time, one Mr Patrick Scot, as Calderwood himself informs us, took it for granted that he\nhe was dead; and thereupon wrote a recantation in his name, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a>, before his decease, he had changed his sentiments. This impolite being detected, Scott went over to Holland, and stayed three weeks at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a>, where he made a diligent search for the author of Altare Damascenum, with a design to have dispatched him. But Calderwood had privately retired into his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> where he lived several years. Scott gave out that the king had furnished him with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> for the pretended recantation, and that he only put it in order. During his retirement, Mr Calderwood collected all the memorials relating to the ecclesiastical affairs of Scotland, from the beginning of the reformation there <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of King James; which collection is still preserved in the university library of Glasgow; that which was published under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of \"The True History of Scotland,\" is only an extract from it. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVERTISEMENT\">advertisement</a> prefixed to the last edition of his Altare Damascenum mention is made of his being minister of Pencaitland near Edinburgh in 1638, but we find nothing said there, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> anywhere else, of his death.","sp":76,"ep":77},{"h":"CALDRON","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a> utensil, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>; having a moveable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> handle, whereby to hang it on the chimney hook.

From the testimonies of Tacitus, Dio, and Solinus, we find, that the ancient Caledonia comprehended all that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> lying to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> Forth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLYDE\">Clyde</a>. In proportion as the Silures <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CIMBRI\">Cimbri</a> advanced towards the north, the Caledonians being circum-\nCaledonia plains. Along its north-east shore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> is flat; and being well watered, and cultivated by the inhabitants after their manner, appeared to great advantage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Cook's people. Was it not, indeed, for those fertile spots on the plains, the whole country might be called a dreary waste: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> and higher parts of the land are in general incapable of cultivation. They consist chiefly of rocks, many of which are full of mud; the little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> that is upon them is scorched and burnt up by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>: it is, however, covered with coarse grass and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, and here and there covered with trees and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>. The country in general bears a great resemblance to those parts of New South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a> which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> under the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> of latitude. Several of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> productions are the same, and the woods are without underwood as well as in that country. The whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> seems to be surrounded by reefs and shoals, which render all access to it extremely dangerous; but at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> the coasts against the attacks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>; rendering it easily navigable along the coast by canoes, and caulking it abound with fish. Every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the coast seems to be inhabited: the plantations in the plains are laid out with great judgment, and cultivated with much labour. They begin their cultivation by setting fire to the grass, &c., with which the ground is covered, but have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> notion of preserving its vigour by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a>; they, however, recruit it by letting it lie for some years untouched. On the beach was found a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of rock, not less than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a> of ten feet, consisting of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> grained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> speckled full of granites somewhat bigger than pine heads, from whence it seems probable that some valuable minerals may be found on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>. It differs from all the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> yet discovered in the South sea, by being entirely destitute of volcanic productions. Several plants of a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> were found here; and a few young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>-fruit trees, not then sufficiently grown to bear fruit, seemed to have come up without culture; plantains and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> canes are here in small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, and the cocoa-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> trees are small and thinly planted. A new species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> flower was likewise met with, which was never known to grow wild anywhere but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>. Several Caputi (M. zaleuca) trees were also found in flower. Muquetos here are very numerous. A great variety of birds was seen of different classes, which were for the most part entirely new; particularly a beautiful species of parrot before unknown to zoologists. A new species of fish, of the genus called by Linnaeus tetraodon, was caught here; and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a>, which was very large, presented at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>. Several species of this genus being reckoned poisonous, and the present species being remarkably ugly, Messrs. Forsters hinted their suspicions of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>; but the temptation of a fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>, and the assurances of Captain Cook that he had formerly eaten this identical sort of fish without harm, got the better of their scruples, and they ate of it. Its olives, however, though it had no other bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> than what proceeded from this, prevented them from taking more than a morsel or two. In a few hours after they had retired to rest, they were awakened by very alarming symptoms, being all seized with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> giddiness; their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> and feet were numbed, so that they were scarcely able to crawl; and a violent languor and oppression seized them. Emetics were administered with some success, but sudorifics gave the greatest relief. Some dogs who had eaten the remainder of the liver were likewise taken ill; and a pig which had eaten the entrails died soon after, having swelled to an unusual size. The effects of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> on the gentlemen did not entirely go off in less than six weeks.\u2014Abundance of turtle was seen here. The natives had not the least notion of goats, hogs, dogs, or cats, and had not even a name for any of them.\n\nThe inhabitants are very stout, tall, and in general well proportioned; their features mild; their beards and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, and strongly frizzled, so as to be somewhat woolly in some individuals; their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> is swarthy, or a dark chestnut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>. A few were seen who measured five feet four inches. They are remarkably courteous, not at all addicted to pilfering and stealing; in which character of honesty they are singular, all the other nations in the South sea being remarkably thieves. Some wear their hair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, and tie it up to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of their heads; others suffer only a large lock to grow on each side, which they tie up in clubs; many others, as well as all the women, wear it crop short. They make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of a kind of comb made of sticks of hard wood, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> or ten inches long, and about the thickness of knitting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLES\">needles</a>; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of these, seldom exceeding 20, but generally fewer, are fastened together at one end, parallel to and near one-tenth of an inch from each other: the ends, which are a little pointed, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> spread out or open like the sticks of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAN\">fan</a>. These combs they always wear in their hair on one side of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. Some had a kind of concave cylindrical stiff black <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>, which appeared to be a great ornament among them, and was supposed to be worn only by the chiefs and warriors. A large sheet of strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, whenever they got one in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a>, was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> applied to this purpose. The men go naked; only tying a string round their middle, and another round their neck. A little piece of a brown cloth made of the bark of a fig tree, sometimes tucked up to the belt, and sometimes pendulous, scarcely deserves the name of a covering; nor indeed does it seem at all intended for that purpose. This piece of cloth is sometimes of such a length, that the extremity is fastened to the string round the neck; to this string they likewise hang small round beads of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> green nephritic stone. Coarse garments were seen among them made of a sort of matting; but they seemed never to wear them, except when in their canoes and unemployed. The women seemed to be in a fertile state: they were the only persons of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> who had any employment, and several of them brought bundles of sticks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> on their backs; those who had children carried them on their backs in a kind of fatchel. The women also were seen to dig up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> in order to plant it. They are in general of a dark chestnut, and sometimes mahogany brown; their stature middle-sized, some being rather tall, and their whole form rather stout and somewhat clumsy. Their dress is the most disfiguring that can be imagined, and gives them a thick squat shape; it is a short petticoat or fringe, consisting of filaments or little cords, about eight inches long, which are fastened to a very long string, which they have tied several times round their waist. The filaments, or little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a>, therefore, lie above each other in several layers, forming a kind of\nCaledonia, thick thatch all round the body, but which does not near cover the thigh; these filaments were sometimes dyed black; but frequently those on the outside only were of that colour, the rest being of a dirty gray. There was not a single instance, during the ship's stay in this island, of the women permitting any indecent familiarity with an European: they took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> in practising the arts of a jilting coquette, but never became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> wantons. The general ornaments of both sexes are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>-rings of tortoise shells; necklaces, or amulets, made of both shells and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>; and bracelets made of large shells, which they wear above the elbows.\n\nThe hovels, or huts, in New Caledonia, are circular, something like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEE\">bee</a>-hive, and full as close and warm; the entrance is by a small door, or long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> hole, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> big enough to admit a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> bent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a>: the side walls are about four feet and a half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> is lofty, and peaked to a point at the top, above which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> or stick of wood, which is generally ornamented either with carving or shells, or both. The framing is of small spars, reeds, &c. and both sides and roof are thick, and close covered with thatch made of coarse long grass. In the inside of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> are set up posts, to which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> spars are fastened, and platforms made for the convenience of laying anything on. Some houses have two floors, one above another; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> is laid with dried grass, and here and there mats are spread for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> people to sit or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> on. In these houses there was no pallage for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> but through the door: they were intolerably smoky, and so hot as to be insupportable to those unaccustomed to them; probably the smoke is intended to drive out the mosquitoes which swarm here. They commonly erect two or three of these huts near each other under a clump of lofty fig trees, whose leaves are impervious to the rays of the sun.\n\nThe canoes used here are very heavy clumsy vessels; they are made of two trees hollowed out, having a raised gunnel about two inches high, and closed at each end with a bulk head of the same height; so that the whole is like a long square trough about three feet shorter than the body of the canoe. Two canoes thus fitted are fastened to each other about three feet under, by means of cross spars, which project about a foot over each side. Over these is laid a deck or heavy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PLATFORM\">platform</a> made of plank and small round spars, on which they have a fire-hearth, and generally a fire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>; they are navigated by one or two lateen sails, extended to a small lateen yard, the end of which is fixed in a notch or hole in the deck.\n\nNotwithstanding the inoffensive disposition of the inhabitants of New Caledonia, they are well provided with offensive weapons; as clubs, spears, darts, and slings for throwing stones. Their clubs are about two feet and a half long, and variously formed; some like a scythe, others like a pick-axe; some have a head like a hawk, and others have round heads; but all are neatly made; many of their darts and spears are useless and ornamented with carvings. The slings are as simple as possible; but they take some pains to form the stones that they use into a proper shape, which is something like an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>, supposing both ends to be like the small one. They drive the dart by the assistance of short cords knobbed at one end and looped at the other, called by the seamen becketts. These contain a quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> taken from the vampire, or great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> bat. Bows and arrows are wholly unknown among them.\n\nTheir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> bears no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> to that spoken in the other South Sea islands, the word arekee and one or two more excepted. This is the more extraordinary, as different dialects of one language were spoken not only in the easterly islands, but at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-NEW_ZEALAND\">New <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZEALAND\">Zealand</a>.\n\nA musical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, a kind of whistle, was procured here. It was a little polished piece of brown wood about two inches long, shaped like a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>, though apparently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>, with a rope fixed at the small end; two holes were made in it near the base, and another near the insertion of the rope, all which communicated with each other; and by blowing in the uppermost, a shrill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> like whistling was produced: no other instrument was seen among them that had the least relation to music.\n\nMany of the New Caledonians were seen with prodigiously thick legs and arms, which seemed to be affected with a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEPROSY\">leprosy</a>; the swelling was found to be extremely hard, but the skin was not alike harsh and scaly in all those who were afflicted with the disorder.

The one is to let the calf run about with its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAM\">dam</a> all the year round; which is the method in the cheap breeding countries, and is generally allowed to make the beef cattle. The other is to take them from the dam after they have sucked about a fortnight; they are then to be taught to drink flat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, which is to be made but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> warm for them, it being very dangerous to give it them too hot. The beef <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of weaning calves is from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> to May: they should have milk for 12 weeks after; and a fortnight before that is left off, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> should be mixed with the milk in larger and larger quantities. When the calf has been fed on milk for about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, little whips of hay should be placed all about him in cleft sticks to induce him to eat. In the beginning of April they should be turned out to graze; only for a few days they should be taken in for the night, and have milk and water given them: the same may also be given them in a pail sometimes in the field, till they are able to feed themselves that they do not regard it. The grazes they are turned into must not be too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, but short and sweet, that they may like it, and yet get it with some labour. Calves should always be weaned at grazes; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it be done with hay and water, they often grow big-bellied on it, and are apt to rot. When those among the males are selected which are to be kept as bulls, the rest should be kept for oxen: the sooner the better. Between 10 and 20 days is a proper\nper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. About <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> almost all the calves are fattened for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTCHER\">butcher</a>. The reason of this is, that there is a good market for them; and the lands there are not so profitable to breed upon as in cheaper countries. The way to make calves fat and fine is, the keeping them very clean: giving them fresh litter every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>: and the hanging a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> chalk <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> in some corner where they can easily get at it to lick it, but where it is out of the way of being fouled by their dung and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>. The coops are to be placed so as not to have too much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> upon them, and so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> above the ground that the urine may run off. They also bleed them once when they are a month old, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time before they kill them; which is a great addition to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and whiteness of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>: the bleeding is by some repeated much oftener, but this is sufficient.\n\nCalves are very apt to be loose in their bowels; which wastes and very much injures them. The remedy is to give them chalk scraped among milk, pouring it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>. If this does not succeed, they give them bale armenic in large doses, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> bath every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>. If a cow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not let a strange calf suck her, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> method is to rub both her nose and the calf's with a little brandy; this generally reconciles them after a few smellings.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">Golden</a> Calf, an idol set up and worshipped by the Israelites at the foot of Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SINAI\">Sinai</a>, in their passage through the wilderness to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANAAN\">Canaan</a>.

Others, with more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, render the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a> thus: \"And Aaron received them (the golden earrings), and tied them up in a bag, and got them cast into a molten calf:\" which version is authorised by the different senses of the word tsur, which signifies to tie up <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> bind, as well as to shape or form; and of the word cherret, which is used both for a graving tool and a bag. Some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> fathers have been of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that this idol had only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of a calf, and the shape of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> from the neck downwards, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISIS\">Isis</a>. Others have thought it was only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of an ox without a body. But the most general opinion is, that it was an entire calf in imitation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APIS\">Apis</a> worshipped by the Egyptians; among whom, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> doubt, the Israelites had acquired their propensity to idolatry. This calf Moses is said to have burnt with fire, reduced to powder, and strewed upon the water which the people were to drink. How this could be accomplished hath been a question. Most people have thought, that as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> is indestructible, it could only be burnt by the miraculous power of God; but M. Stahl conjectures that Moses dissolved it by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> of sulphur*. The Rabbins tell us that the people were made to drink of this water in order to distinguish the idolaters from the rest; for that as soon as they had drunk of it, the beards of the former turned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>. The Cabalists add, that the calf weighed 125 quintals; which they gather from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> word mafsekhah, whose numerical letters make 125.\n\nCalf Skins, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> manufacture, are prepared and dressed by the tanners, skinners, and curriers, who fell them for the use of the shoemakers, saddlers, bookbinders, and other artificers, who employ them in their several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>.\n\nCalf Skin dyed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-SUMACH\">sumach</a>, denotes the skin of this animal curried <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> side, and dyed of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> on the flesh side, by means of sumach, chiefly used in the making of belts.\n\nThe English calf-skin is much valued abroad, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> thereof very considerable in France and other countries; where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> attempts have been made to imitate it, but hitherto in vain.

This scale is constructed on the following geometrical theorem, viz. that the weights of spheres are as the cubes of their diameters.\n\nOn the lower part of the circular head of the face A is a scale of divisions marked *bores of guns*; for the use of which, the legs of the callipers are slipped across each other, till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> points touch the concave surface of the gun in its greatest breadth; then the bevil edge F of the face B <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> cut a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> in the scale showing the diameter of the bore in inches and tenths.\n\nWithin the scales of *shot and bore diameters* on the circular part of A, are divisions marked *pounders*: the inner figures \u00bd, 1\u00bd, 3, 5\u00bd, 8, 12, 18, 26, 36, correspond to the longest lines; and the figures, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 16, 24, 32, 42, to the short strokes. When the bore of a gun is taken between the points of the callipers, the bevil edge F will either cut or be near one of these divisions, and show the weight of iron shot proper for that gun.\n\nOn the upper half of the circular head of the face A are three concentric scales of degrees; the outer scale consisting of 180 degrees numbered from right to left, 10, 20, &c., the middle numbered the contrary way, and the outer scale beginning at the middle, with 0, and numbered on each side to 90 degrees.

Let one end of a thread be fixed into the notch on the plate B, and any weight tied to the other end: apply the straight side of the plate A to the side of the body whose inclination is sought; hold it in this position, and move the plate B, till the thread falls upon the line near the centre marked *perp.* Then will the bevil edge F cut the degrees on the inner scale, showing the inclination of that body to the horizon.\n\nOn the face C near the point of the callipers is a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> showing the proportion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">troy</a> and avoirdupois weights, by which one kind of weight may be easily reduced into another.\n\nNear the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> of the face D of the callipers are two tables showing the proportion between the pounds weight of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, and also between the lengths of the foot measure of England and France.\n\nNear the extreme on the face A is a table containing four rules of the circle and sphere; and geometrical figures with numbers annexed to them: the first is a circle including the proportion in round numbers of the diameter to its circumference; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> is a circle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, and a square within that circle, and another circle in the inner square: the numbers 28, 22, above this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> exhibit the proportion of the outward square to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of the inscribed circle; and the numbers 14, 11, below it, show the proportion between the area of the inscribed square and the area of its inscribed circle. The third is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a> inscribed in a sphere; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> 89 shows that a cube of iron, inscribed in a sphere of 12 inches in diameter, weighs 89\u00bd. The fourth is a sphere in a cube, and the number 243 expresses the weight in pounds of a sphere inscribed in a cube whose side is 12 inches: the fifth represents a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> and cone of one foot diameter and height: the number in the cylinder shows, that an iron cylinder of that diameter and height weighs 364\u00bdlb.; and the number 121\u00bd in the cone expresses the weight of a cone, the diameter of whose base is 12 inches, and of the same height: the sixth figure shows that an iron cube, whose side is 12 inches, weighs 464\u00bdlb., and that a square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a> of iron, whose base is a square foot and height 12 inches, weighs 134\u00bdlb. The numbers which have been hitherto fixed to the four last figures were not strictly true; and therefore they have been corrected in the figure here referred to; and by these the figures on any instrument of this kind should be corrected likewise.\n\nOn the leg B of the callipers, is a table showing the weights of a cubic inch or foot of various bodies in pounds avoirdupois.\n\nOn the face D of the circular head of the callipers is a table contained between five concentric segments of rings: the inner one marked *Guns* shows the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the gun or the weight of ball it carries; the two next rings contain the quantity of powder used for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to brass guns, and the two outermost rings show the quantity for proof and service in iron cannon.\n\nOn the face A is a table exhibiting the method of computing the number of *shot or shells* in a triangular, square, or rectangular pile. Near this is placed a table containing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> rules relative to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of bodies, expressed in an algebraic manner: nearer the centre we have another table of rules for raising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, calculated on the supposition, that one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> is equal in this kind of labour to five men, and that one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> will raise a hogshead of water to eight feet of height in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> at that rate for some hours. N.B. Hogsheads are reckoned at 60 gallons.\n\nSome of the leading principles in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNNERY\">gunnery</a>, relating to *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a>* in cannon and mortars, are expressed on the face B of the callipers. Besides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> already enumerated,\nenumerated, the scales usually marked on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTOR\">sector</a> are laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> on this instrument; thus the line of inches is placed on the edge of the callipers, or on the straight borders of the faces C, D: the logarithmic scales of numbers, lines, verified lines, and tangents, are placed along these faces near the straight edges: the line of lines is placed on the same faces in an angular position, and marked Lin. The lines of planes or surfaces are also exhibited on the faces C and D, tending towards the centre, and marked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">Plan</a>.

For a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> California was thought to be an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>; but Father Caimo, a German Jesuit, discovered it to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> joining to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a> and the southern parts of America. The peninsula extends from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> St Sebastien, lying in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> latitude 43\u00b0 30', to Cape St Lucar which lies in north latitude 22\u00b0 32'. It is divided from New Mexico by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a>, or as some call it the lake, of California, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMILION\">Vermilion</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">Sea</a>, on the east; on the north, by that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the continent of North America which is least known; and on the west and south, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PACIFIC_OCEAN\">Pacific ocean</a> or great South sea. The coasts, especially towards the Vermilion sea, are covered with inhabited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, on some of which the Jesuits have established settlements, such as St Clement, Paxaros, St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>, Cedars (so called from the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of these trees it produces), St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a>, and a multitude of others. But the islands best known are three lying off Cape St Lucar, towards the Mexican coast. These are called Les Tres Marias, \"the three Maries.\" They are small, but have good wood and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> pits, and abundance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAME\">game</a>; therefore the English and French pirates have sometimes wintered there, when bound on cruises in the South seas.\n\nAs California lies altogether within the temperate zone, the natives are neither chilled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> nor scorched with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>; and indeed the improvements in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> made by the Jesuits afford strong proofs of the excellency of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>. In some places the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is extremely hot and dry; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> wild, rugged, and barren. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> stretching about 800 miles in length, there must be considerable variations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> and climate; and indeed we find, from good authority, that California produces some of the most beautiful lawns, as well as many of the most inhospitable deserts, in the universe. Upon the whole, although California is rather rough and craggy, we are assured by the Jesuit Vinegas, and other good writers, that with due culture it furnishes every necessary and convenience of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; and that, even where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> is hottest, vapours rising from the sea, and dispersed by pleasant breezes, render it of a moderate temperature.\n\nThe peninsula of California is now stocked with all sorts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> animals known in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> and Mexico. Horses, mules, asses, oxen, sheep, hogs, goats, and all other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a> imported, thrive and increase in this country. Among the native animals is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of deer of the size of a young heifer, and greatly resembling it in shape; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> is like that of a deer, and the horns thick and crooked like those of a ram. The hoof of the animal is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, round, and cloven, the skin spotted, but\nCalifornia, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> thinner and the tail sharper than those of a deer. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> is greatly esteemed. There is another animal peculiar to this country, larger and more bulky than a sheep, but greatly resembling it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, and like it, covered with a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>. The flesh of this animal is nourishing and delicious; and, happily for the natives, it is so abundant, that nothing more is required than the trouble of hunting, as these animals wander about in droves in the forests and on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>. Father Torquemado describes a creature which he calls a species of large bear, something like a buffalo, of the size of a steer, and nearly of the figure of a stag. Its hair is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of a yard in length, its neck long and awkward, and on its forehead are horns branched like those of a stag. The tail is a yard in length and half a yard in breadth; and the hoofs cloven like those of an ox. With regard to birds, we have but an imperfect account; only, in general, Father Vinegas tells us that the coast is plentifully stored with peacocks, bustards, geese, cranes, and most of the birds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in other parts of the world. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of fish which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> to these coasts is incredible. Salmon, turbot, barbel, skate, mackerel, &c., are caught here with very little trouble; together with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEARL\">pearl</a> oysters, common oysters, lobster, and a variety of exquisite shell fish. Plenty of turtle are also caught on the coasts. On the South sea coasts are found shell fish peculiar to it, and perhaps the most beautiful in the world; their luster surpassing that of the finest pearl, and darting their rays through a transparent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a> of an elegant vivid blue, like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAPIS\">lapis</a> lazuli. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of California for pearls soon drew forth great numbers of adventurers, who searched every part of the gulf, and are still employed in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, notwithstanding fashion has greatly diminished the value of this elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> production. Father Torquemado observes that the sea of California affords very rich pearl <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a>; and that the beds, or beds of oysters, may be seen in three or four fathom water, almost as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they were on the surface.\n\nThe extremity of the peninsula towards Cape St Lucar is more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>, temperate, and fertile, than the other parts, and consequently more woody. In the more distant parts, even to the farthest missions on the east coast, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> hath yet been discovered. A species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANNA\">manna</a> is found in this country, which, according to the accounts of the Jesuits, has all the sweetness of refined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> without its whiteness. The natives firmly believe that this juice drops from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>.\n\nThe Californians are well made, and very strong. They are extremely pugnacious, inconstant, stupid, and even intemperate, and seem extremely desirous of the character given to the Indians in general, under the article America. Before the Europeans penetrated into California, the natives had no form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. The missionaries indeed tell us many tales concerning them, but they evidently bear the marks of forgery as not to be worth repeating. Each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> was then an assemblage of several cottages more or less numerous, that were all mutually confederated by alliances, but without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a>. They were strangers even to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILIAL\">filial</a> obedience. No kind of dress was used by the men; but the women made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of some coverings, and were even fond of ornamenting themselves with California pearls and such other trinkets as the country afforded. What most displayed their ingenuity was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> nets, which are said by the Jesuits to have even exceeded in goodness those made in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. They were made by the women, of a coarse kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a> procured from some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> which grow there. Their houses were built of branches and leaves of trees; nay, many of them were only enclosures of earth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, raised half a yard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, without any covering; and even these were so small, that they could not stretch themselves at length in them. In winter, they dwelt underground in caves either natural or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a>.\n\nIn 1526, Ferdinand Cortez having reduced and settled Mexico, attempted the conquest of California; but was obliged to return, without even taking a survey of the country, a report of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> having dispersed the Mexicans to a general insurrection. Some other attempts were made by the officers of Cortez, but these were also unsuccessful; and this valuable coast was long neglected by the Spaniards, who, to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> have but one settlement upon it. In 1595, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALLEON\">galleon</a> was sent to make discoveries on the Californian shore; but the vessel was unfortunately lost. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">Seven</a> years after, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> de Monteroy, then viceroy of New Spain, sent Sebastian Biscayno on the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> with two ships and a tender; but he made no discovery of importance. In 1684, the marquis de Laguna, also viceroy of New Spain, despatched two ships with a tender to make discoveries on the lake of California. He returned with an indifferent account, but was among the first who asserted that California was not an island; which was afterwards confirmed by Father Cino, as already related. In 1697, the Spaniards being discouraged by their losses and disappointments, the Jesuits solicited and obtained permission to undertake the conquest of California. They arrived among the savages with curiosities that might amuse them, corn for their food, and clothes for which they could not but perceive the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>. The hatred these people bore the Spanish name could not support itself against these demonstrations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>. They testified their acknowledgments as much as their want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> and their inconstancy would permit them. These faults were partly overcome by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> instructors, who pursued their project with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of warmth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> peculiar to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>. They made themselves carpenters, masons, weavers, and husbandmen; and by these means succeeded in imparting knowledge, and in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for the useful arts, to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> people, who have been all successively formed into one body. In 1745, they composed 43 villages, separated from each other by the barrenness of the soil and the want of water. The inhabitants of these small villages subsist principally on corn and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a>, which they cultivate; and on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> and domestic animals of Europe, the breeding of which last is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. The Indians have each their field, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of what they reap, but such is their want of foresight, that they would squander in a day what they had gathered, if the missionary did not take upon himself to distribute it to them as they stand in need of it. They manufacture some coarse stuffs; and the necessaries they are\nIn want of are purchased with pearls, and with wine nearly resembling that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MADEIRA\">Madeira</a>, which they sell to the Mexicans and to the galleons, and which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> hath shown the necessity of prohibiting in California. A few laws, which are very simple, are sufficient to regulate this rising state. In order to enforce them, the missionary chooses the most intelligent person of the village; who is empowered to whip and imprison; the only punishments of which they have any knowledge. In all California there are only two garrisons, each consisting of 30 men, and a soldier with every missionary. These troops were chosen by the legislators, though they are paid by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. Were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MADRID\">Madrid</a> to push their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> with half the zeal of the Jesuits, California might become one of the most valuable of their acquisitions, an account of the pearls and other valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> which the country contains. At present the little Spanish town near Cape St Lucar is made use of for no other purpose than as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of refreshment for the Manila ships, and the head residence of the missionaries.","sp":85,"ep":87},{"h":"CALIGA","t":"in Roman antiquity, was the proper folder's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOE\">shoe</a>, made in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SANDAL\">sandal</a> fashion, without upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> to cover the superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the foot, though otherwise reaching to the middle of the leg, and fastened with thongs.

After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, Callot returned to his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; when he was very favourably received by Henry duke of Lorraine, who settled a considerable pension upon him. His reputation being soon after spread all over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, the infant of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NETHERLANDS\">Netherlands</a> drew him to Bruxelles, where he engraved the siege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREDA\">Breda</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIII. made him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> the siege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROCHELLE\">Rochelle</a>, and that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of Rh\u00e9. The French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, having taken Nancy in 1631, made Callot the proposal of representing that new conquest, as he had already done the taking of Rochelle; but Callot begged to be excused; and some courtiers resolving to oblige him to do it, he answered, that he would sooner cut off his thumb than do anything against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of his prince and country. This excuse the king accepted; and said, that the duke of Lorraine was happy in having such faithful and affectionate subjects. Callot followed his business so closely, that, though he died at 43 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, he is said to have left of his own execution about 1500 pieces. The following are a few of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a>. 1. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> of the innocents, a small oval plate, engraved at Florence. Callot engraved the same subject at Nancy, with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in the figures on the back ground. The former is the most rare; a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of it is very difficult to be found. 2. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> of Cana in Galilee, from Paolo Veronele, a middling sized plate, lengthwise. 3. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> of Christ, on 12 very small upright plates: first impressions very scarce. 4. St John in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATMOS\">Patmos</a>, a small plate, nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>. 5. The temptation of St Anthony, a middling sized plate, lengthwise. He also engraved the same subject larger; which, though not the best, is notwithstanding the rarest print. There is a considerable difference in the treatment of the subject in the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a>. 6. The punishments, wherein is seen the execution of several criminals. The marks of the best impressions of this plate are, a small square tower which appears above the houses, towards the left, and a very small image of the Virgin placed in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of the wall, near the middle of the print. 7. The miseries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, 18 small plates, lengthwise. There is another set on the same subject, consisting of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> plates less than the former. 8. The great fair of Florence, so called because it was engraved at Florence. As several parts of this plate were not equally bitten by the aquafortis, it is difficult to meet with a fine impression. Callot, on his return to Nancy, re-engraved this plate without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a>, however, is by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means equal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>.

There is also a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> copy of this print, reversed, published by Savery; but the difference is easily distinguished between it and the true print. 9.

This is one of the scarcest of Cal-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a>'s prints; and it is very difficult to meet with a fine\nimpression of it, for the distances and other parts of the\nplate failed in the biting it with the aquafortis. 10.

It ever appears in meetings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> exchanges; in congregates for determining of peace or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>; and even in the very fury of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCEPTANCE\">acceptance</a> of the calumet is a mark of concurrence with the terms proposed; as the refusal is a certain mark of rejection. Even in the rage of a conflict this pipe is sometimes offered; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> accepted, the weapons of destruction instantly drop from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and a truce ensues. It seems the sacrament of the favours; for no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> is ever violated which is confirmed by a whiff from this holy reed. When they treat of war, the pipe and all its ornaments are usually red, or sometimes red only on one side. The size and decorations of the calumet are for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> proportioned to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the persons to whom they are presented, and to the importance of the occasion. The calumet of peace is different from that of war. They make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the former to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a> their alliances and treaties, to travel with safety, and to receive strangers; but of the latter to proclaim war. It consists of a red <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, like marble, formed into a cavity resembling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a> pipe, and fixed to a hollow reed. They adorn it with feathers of various colours; and name it the calumet of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, to which luminary they present it, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of thereby obtaining a change of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> as often as they desire. From the winged ornaments of the calumet, and its conciliating uses, writers compare it to the caduceus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a>, which was carried by the caduceatores, or messengers of peace, with terms to the hostile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>. It is singular, that the most remote nations, and the most opposite in their other customs and manners, should in some things have, as it were, a certain consent of thought. The Greeks and the Americans had the same idea, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of the caduceus of the one, and the calumet of the other.\n\nDance of the Calumet, is a solemn rite among the Indians on various occasions. They dare not wash themselves in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> in the beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> of the new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, without performing it; and the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> always confirms a peace or precedes a war. It is performed in the winter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> in their cabins, and in summer in the open fields. For this purpose they choose a spot among trees to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> them from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the sun, and lay in the middle a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> mat, as a carpet, setting upon it the monitor, or god, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>.

Things being thus disposed, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a> come, those who are to sing take the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> seats under the shade of the trees. The company is then ranged round, every one, before he sits <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, saluting the monitor, which is done by blowing upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> of their tobacco. Each person next receives the calumet in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a>, and holding it with both hands, dances to the cadence of the vocal music, which is accompanied with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> of a sort of drum.

This mock engagement being over, he who holds the calumet makes a speech, in which he gives an account of the battles he has fought, and the prisoners he has taken, and then receives a cloak, or some other present, from the chief of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>. He then resigns the calumet to another, who, having acted a similar part, delivers it to a third, who afterwards gives it to his neighbour, till at last the instrument returns to the person that began the ceremony, who presents it to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> invited to the feast, as a mark of their friendship, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a>, when this is the occasion of the entertainment.","sp":94,"ep":94},{"h":"CALUMNY","t":"the crime of accusing another falsely, and knowingly so, of some heinous offence.\n\nOath of Calumny, juramentum (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> rather jusjurandum) Calumniae, among civilians and canonists, was an oath which both parties in a cause were obliged to take; the plaintiff that he did not bring his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>, and the defendant that he did not deny it, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to abuse each other, but because they believed their cause was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> and good; that they would not deny the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, nor create unnecessary delays, nor offer the judge or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> any gifts or bribes. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the plaintiff refused this oath, the complaint or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBEL\">libel</a> was dismissed; if the defendant, it was taken pro confesso.

He was the son of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COOPER\">cooper</a> of Noyon in Picardy; and his real name was Chauvin, which he chose to latinize into Calvinus, styling himself in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> page to his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> (a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMENTARY\">Commentary</a> on Seneca de Clementia), \"Lucius Calvinus, Civis Romanus;\" an early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a>, at about 24 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. In 1529, he was rector of Pont l'Eveque; and in 1534 he threw up this benefice, separating himself entirely from the Romish church. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a> against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a> in France (with whom he was now associated) obliged him to retire to Basle in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>; here he published his famous Institutes of the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> in 1536. The following year he was chosen professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>, and one of the ministers of the church at Geneva. The next year, viz. 1537, he made all the people solemnly swear to a body of doctrines; but finding that religion had not yet had any great influence on the morals of the people, he, assisted by other ministers, declared, that since all their admonitions and warnings had proved unsuccessful, they could not celebrate the holy sacrament as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as these disorders reigned; he also declared, that he could not submit to some regulations made by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNOD\">synod</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERNE\">Berne</a>. Upon which the syndics having summoned the people, it was ordered that Calvin and two other ministers should leave the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> within two days. Upon this Calvin retired to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STRASBOURG\">Strasbourg</a>, where he established a French church, of which he was the first minister, and was also chosen professor of divinity there. Two years after he was chosen to assist at the diet appointed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> to meet at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">Worms</a> and at Ratibon in order to appease the troubles occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of religion. He went with Bucer, and entered into a conference with Melanchthon. The people of Geneva now entreated him to return; to which he consented, and arrived at Geneva, September 13, 1541. He began with establishing a form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>, and a consistorial jurisdiction, with the power of inflicting all kinds of canonical punishments. This was greatly disliked by many persons, who imagined that the papal tyranny would soon be revived. Calvin, however, affected on all occasions the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of his consistory with inflexible strictness; and he caused Michael Servetus to be burnt at the stake for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> against the doctrine of the Trinity. But though the rigour of his proceedings sometimes occasioned great tumults in the city, yet nothing could shake his steadiness and inflexibility. Amongst all the disturbances of the commonwealth, he took care of the foreign churches in England, France, Germany, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a>; and did more by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> than his presence, sending his advice and instructions by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>, and writing a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of books. This great reformer died on the 27th of May 1564, aged 55. His works were printed together at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a> in 1671, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> volumes folio; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> of which are his Institutions, in Latin, the best edition of which is that of Robert Stephens in 1553, in folio; and his Commentaries on the Holy Scriptures.\u2014Calvin is universally allowed to have had great talents, an excellent genius, and profound learning. His style is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> and polite.

Calvinism subsists in its greatest purity in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Geneva; and from thence it was first propagated into Germany, France, the United Provinces, and England. In France it was abolished by the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685. It has been the prevailing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> in the United Provinces ever since the year 1571. The theological system of Calvin was adopted, and made the public rule of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> in England, under the reign of Edward VI, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Scotland was modelled by John Knox, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Calvin, agreeably to the doctrine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a>, and form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, established at Geneva.

Calvin considered every church as a separate and independent body, invested with the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a> for itself. He proposed that it should be governed by presbyteries and synods, composed of clergy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAITY\">laity</a>, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, or any clerical subordination; and maintained, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of the civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> extended only to its protection and outward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>. In order to facilitate an union with the Lutheran church, he acknowledged a real, though spiritual, presence of Christ, in the Eucharist, that true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> were united to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> Christ in this ordinance, and that divine grace was conferred upon them, and sealed to them, in the celebration of it; and he confined the privilege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a> to pious and regenerate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEVERS\">believers</a>.

It takes the name of Cambridge from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAM\">Cam</a>, which divides the town into two parts. Either it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the neighbourhood was styled Camborium, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>. It suffered much during the wars with the Danes. Here was a castle built by William the Conqueror, of which the gatehouse yet remains, and is now the county gaol. By Doomsday-book it appears that it then had ten wards, containing 387 houses. In William Rufus's reign it was quite destroyed by Roger de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTGOMERY\">Montgomery</a>; but Henry I. bestowed many privileges upon it to encourage its restoration, particularly an exemption from the power of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a>, on condition of its paying yearly into the exchequer 100 merks (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to 1000 pounds now), and from tolls, laffage, pontage, paillage, and stallage, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAIRS\">fairs</a> of his dominions. It was afterwards often plundered in the barons wars by the outlaws from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELY\">Ely</a>, till Henry III. secured it by a deep ditch. In 1388, Richard II. held a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> here. In the rebellion of Wat Tyler and Jack Straw against that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, the university records were taken and burnt in the market place.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> town is about one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> from south to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, and about half a mile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> in the middle, diminishing at the extremities. It has 14 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> churches, of which two are without any towers. It contains above 1200 houses; but the private buildings are neither elegant nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, owing chiefly to their being held on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> or corporation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a>.

The Jews being encouraged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in England by William I. and II. were very populous here for several generations, and inhabited that street now called the Jewry. They had a synagogue, since converted to a parish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, called from the shape of its tower Round Church; though others are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that it was built by the Knights <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEMPLARS\">Templars</a>, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> a resemblance to the Temple church in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. The market place is situated in the middle of the town, and consists of two spacious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> squares united together; at the top of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> stands the shire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a>, lately erected at the expense of the county. At the back of the shire hall is the town hall and gaol. In the market place, fronting the shire hall, is a remarkably handsome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> conduit, to which water is conveyed Cambridge by an aqueduct, which was the benefaction of the celebrated Hobson, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRIER\">carrier</a> in the reign of James I. who was a native of this town. A fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> for the benefit of the inhabitants and students was made a few years since for four miles, from this town to Gogmagog hills, pursuant to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> of Mr Worts. The late Dr Adenbrooke also left it 400l. towards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> and furnishing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a> for the cure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> diseased people gratis; of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of Catharine hall is a trustee: which hospital has been erected at the south-east end of the town. At a little distance from Bennet college is the botanic garden of five acres, and a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the governors and the residence of the curator, given to the university by the late Dr Walker, who settled an estate on it towards its support; to which the late Mr Edward Betham added a very considerable benefaction. The town has fairs on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 24. and August 14.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of Cambridge is its university; but when it had its beginning is uncertain. At first there was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> public provision for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> or maintenance of the scholars; but afterwards inns began to be erected by pious persons for their reception, and in the time of Edward I. colleges began to be built and endowed. This university, not inferior to any in Christendom, consists of 12 colleges and 4 halls, which have the same privileges as the colleges. The whole body, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> about 1500, enjoys very great privileges granted by several of our sovereigns; but it was James I. who empowered it to send two members to parliament, as the town had done from the first. The university is governed, 1. By a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a>, who is always some nobleman, and may be changed every three years, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> longer by the tacit consent of the university. 2. By a high steward, chosen by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>, and holding his place by patent from the university. 3. By a vice-chancellor, who is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of some college or hall, and chosen yearly by the body of the university, the heads of the colleges naming two. 4. By two proctors chosen every year, according to the cycle of colleges and halls; as are two taxors, who with the proctors regulate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WEIGHTS_AND_MEASURES\">weights and <a class</a>=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, as clerks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a>. The proctors also inspect the behaviour of the scholars, who must not be out of their colleges after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> at night. Here are also 2 moderators, 2 scrutators, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSARY\">commissary</a>, public orator, 2 librarians, a registrar, a school-keeper, 3 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ESQUIRE\">esquire</a> beadles and a yeoman beadle, 18 professors, and the caput, consisting of the vice-chancellor, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>, a doctor of laws, a doctor of physic, a regent and a non-regent master of arts. Henry VI. granted it the power to print all books of any kind within itself, a privilege which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> had not. The senate house of the university is an elegant building of the Corinthian order, cost near 16,000l. building; in which on the north side is a fine statue of George I., erected in 1739 at the expense of the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Townshend; opposite to this on the south side is another of George II., erected in 1765 at the expense of the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEWCASTLE\">Newcastle</a>: at the east end, on each side of the entrance, are two others; one, the late duke of Somerset, after the Vandyke <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>; the other, an Italian emblematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of Gloria. This is allowed to be the most superb room in England, being 101 feet long.\nCambridge. long, 42 broad, and 32 high; and it has a gallery which can contain 1000 persons. This building forms the north side of the quadrangle, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> and public library do the west, the schools being the ground <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>, and the library over them surrounding a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>. North of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> school is the repository of Dr Woodward's fossils, ores, shells, &c. The doctor, together with that collection and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his library, left a sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> to this university for erecting a professorship for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> philosophy, with a provision of \u00a3500 a-year for ever. At the south-east corner of this building is an elegant geometrical stone staircase which leads to the old library, and consists of 18 classes; at the end of which is an elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> room, in which are deposited the MSS. and a valuable cabinet of oriental books and curiosities, &c. This room opens to two other rooms, containing 26 large classes consisting of 30,000 volumes presented to the university by George I., being the entire collection of Dr Moore bishop of Ely, and purchased of the doctor's executors by his majesty for 6000 guineas; before which his majesty gave the university \u00a32000, to defray the expense of fitting up the apartments and erecting classes for their reception; they consist of the first editions of the Greek and Latin classics and historians, and the greatest part of the works of the first printers; large collections of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a> by the greatest masters; and a valuable MS. of the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles on vellum in Greek and Latin capitals, given to the university by Theodore Beza, and supposed to be as old as any MS. extant. The other part of the library has been rebuilt in an elegant manner, and forms the west side of the intended quadrangle. The books which are contained in the last room are part of the old library augmented with a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the best modern books, several of which are presents from foreign sovereigns and eminent men. The fourth side of the quadrangle is designed for a building to contain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> office, &c. of the university, for which preparations began lately to be made by pulling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the old buildings on the spot. St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>'s church forms the east side of this quadrangle: here the university have their public sermons; and the pulpit, which stands in the centre of the church and faces the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCEL\">chancel</a>, has no soundingboard. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> gallery over part of the chancel is a seat for the chancellor, vice-chancellor, &c., George I. when he gave the books, also established a professor of modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> and modern languages in this university, with a salary of \u00a3400, for himself and two persons under him qualified to instruct in that branch, 20 scholars, to be nominated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, each of whom is obliged to learn at least two of the languages. A fellowship is founded at Magdalen college, appropriated to the gentlemen of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORFOLK\">Norfolk</a>, and called the travelling Norfolk fellowship. All the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LIBRARIES\">libraries</a> in Cambridge, except that of King's college, are lending libraries; and those at Oxford are studying libraries. The different colleges are as follow:\n\n1. St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>'s, the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a>, and the first on entering the town from London, consisting of two courts, separated by a cloister and gallery. The largest is 144 feet long, and 84 broad. The buildings in this court have been lately repaired in an elegant manner. The lesser court is divided by the chapel, which is a fine old building, 54 feet long, 27 broad, and 27 high.\n\nThis college was founded 1257. There are three colleges in Oxford which dispute the antiquity with this. Cambridge and Oxford were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> long before they were possessed of any colleges in their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, the students then lodging and boarding with the townsmen, and they then hired hotels for their exercises and disputations. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOTEL\">hotel</a> or hall, now denominated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a>'s school, situated on the west side of the river, is one of the ancient hotels that remain undemolished, and in which Erasmus read his first Greek lectures in England. 2. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLARE\">Clare</a> hall, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of the river, over which it has an elegant stone bridge, was founded 1326, consisting of one grand court 150 feet long and 111 broad. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of this building that faces the fields has the appearance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>. To this college a new chapel has been added. 3. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEMBROKE\">Pembroke</a> hall is near St Peter's college, and was founded in 1343; it consists of two courts. It has an elegant chapel built by Sir Christ. Wren. 4. Corpus Christi or Bennet college, founded in 1350, has but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> appearance, but is possessed of a remarkably large collection of valuable and curious ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a>. 5. Trinity hall, on the north of Clare hall, near the river, was founded in 1351; it is a small but remarkably neat building. 6. Gonvil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIUS\">Caius</a> college is near the middle of the town, north of the senate house, and has three courts. It was founded 1348, and augmented 1557. 7. King's college, the most noble foundation in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, was first endowed by Henry VI. The old court resembles a decayed castle more than a college. The new building is very magnificent, near 300 feet long. The chapel is one of the finest pieces of Gothic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> now remaining in the world. It is 304 feet long, 73 broad on the outside and 40 within, and 91 high; and yet not a single pillar to sustain its ponderous roofs, of which it has two: the first is of stone, most curiously carved; the other of wood, covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, between which is a vacancy of 10 feet. There is such a profusion of carvings both within and without as is nowhere to be equalled. Henry VII. enlarged it 188 feet in length, and Henry VIII. gave the elegant stalls and organ gallery, with its inimitable carvings, where are the coats of arms of that king and those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a> Boleyn quartered. He gave also the elegant painted glass windows, which are in fine preservation, and were permitted by Cromwell to be preserved when almost every other in England was destroyed, as he had a particular regard for this university where he had his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, and for the town which he had represented in parliament. A new altar has been lately erected, which corresponds with the architecture of the building, embellished with an antique <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> of Christ taking down from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>, purchased in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, and presented to the college by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Carlisle. In this chapel are put up the Spanish colours taken at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of Manila by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> Draper, a member of this college. This college has an ancient stone bridge over the Cam. 8. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a>'s college near the river, south of King's, was founded 1448, and consists of two courts, with a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROVE\">grove</a> and gardens on both sides of the river, connected with each other and the college by two wooden bridges, one of which is of a curious structure. 9. Catharine hall is east of Queen's, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> front on the west.\nCambridge-west, the most extensive and regular in the university. It contains only one court 180 feet long and 120 broad, and was founded in 1475. 10. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> college is at the east end of the town, surrounded by groves and gardens. The principal front faces the south, 180 feet long, regularly built and faired; it was originally a Benedictine convent, and converted to the present use in 1576. 11. Christ's college is opposite to St Andrew's church, on the east side of the town; and was founded by Henry VII's mother in 1505. It has lately had a thorough repair, and is now a neat and beautiful structure. 12. St John's college was founded by the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> in 1599, on the site of a dissolved priory. It consists of three courts, and has a large library filled with scarce and valuable books. To this college belongs a fine stone bridge over the river, which leads to their grand walks. 13. Magdalen college, the only one that stands on the north side of the river, near the great bridge, consists of two courts, and was founded in 1519. 14. Trinity college is east of the river, having St John's college on the north and Caius's college and Trinity hall on the south. It contains two large quadrangles, the first of which is 344 feet long and 280 broad. It has two noble entrances; and on the north side of it is the chapel, 204 feet long, 34 broad, and 44 high. It has every grand ornament, and the much admired statue of Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton, who was a student in this college. The hall is above 100 feet long, 40 broad, and 50 high. The inner court is esteemed the finest in the university, and surpasses any in Oxford. It is very spacious, and has an elegant cloister of stone pillars, supporting grand apartments; on the west is the library, the most elegant structure of the kind in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, 190 feet long, 40 broad, and 38 high within. Its entrance is by a staircase, the steps <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> marble, and the walls incrusted with ancient Roman monuments. The entrance into the library is by folding doors at the north end. Its inside appearance is inexpressibly grand, having at the south end (lately erected) a beautiful painted glass window of his present majesty in his robes; and the clothes are large, beautiful, and noble, well stocked with books, manuscripts, &c. Its outside has every suitable embellishment, and was erected by Sir Christopher Wren at the expense of near 20,000l. Under this building is a spacious piazza of equal dimensions; out of which open three gates to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAWN\">lawn</a> that leads to the river, over which is a new elegant cycloidal bridge of three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>, leading to extensive walks. In the middle is a remarkable vista. This college was founded on the site of two other colleges and a hall in 1546 by Henry VIII. 15. Emmanuel college is at the south-east end of the town; consists of two courts, the principal of which is very neat; and was built on the site of a Dominican convent. It has been lately in a great part rebuilt and elegantly embellished. 16. Sidney-Suffex college is in Bridge-street. Its hall is elegant, but the chapel remarkable only for standing north and south, as others do east and west. The number of inhabitants in the town of Cambridge in 1801, was 10,087.","sp":98,"ep":100},{"h":"CAMBRIDGESHIRE","t":"an inland <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of England, bounded on the east by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORFOLK\">Norfolk</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUFFOLK\">Suffolk</a>, on the south by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSEX\">Essex</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HERTFORDSHIRE\">Hertfordshire</a>, on the west by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEDFORDSHIRE\">Bedfordshire</a> and Huntingdonshire, and on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> by Cambridgeshire, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLNSHIRE\">Lincolnshire</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">Prior</a> to the arrival of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> it was included in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the Iceni; and after their conquest, in the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Flavia Caesariensis, which reached from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a> to the Humber.

It consists of fenny ground, divided by innumerable channels and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAINS\">drains</a>: and is part of a very spacious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>, containing 300,000 acres of land, extending into Norfolk, Suffolk, Huntingdonshire, and Lincolnshire. The Isle of Ely is the north division of the county, and extends south almost as far as Cambridge. The whole level of which this is part, is bounded on one side by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and on the others by uplands: which taken together form a rude kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a> resembling a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOE\">shoe</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is very different in different parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. In the fens it is moist and foggy, and therefore not wholesome; but in the south and east parts it is very good, these being much drier than the other: but both, by late improvements, have been rendered very fruitful, the former by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-DRAINING\">draining</a>, and the latter by cinquefoil: so that it produces plenty of corn, especially barley, saffron, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a>, and affords the richest pastures. The rivers abound with fish, and the fens with wild fowl. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> of the county are malt, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, and baskets. As the above tract appears to have been dry land formerly, the great change it has undergone must have been owing either to a violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> and inundation of the sea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> to earthquakes. As the towns in and about the fens were great sufferers by the stagnation of the waters in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, and want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> in winter, many attempts were made to drain them, but without success, until the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I. in which, and that of his son, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> was happily completed, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of parliament passed, by which a corporation was established for its preservation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. By the same act, 83,000 acres were vested in the corporation and 10,000 in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>. In these fens are a great many decoys, in which incredible numbers of ducks, and other wild fowl, are caught during the season. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of the county of Cambridge, as it was taken in 1801, amounted to 89,349 persons.\n\nNew CAMBRIDGE, a town of New England about three\nCambridge, three miles from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOSTON\">Boston</a>, remarkable for an university consisting of three colleges.

Beza found it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONASTERY\">monastery</a> of Irenaeus at Lyons in the year 1562, and gave it to the university of Cambridge in 1582. It is a quarto size, and written on vellum; 66 leaves of it are much torn and mutilated, ten of which are supplied by a later transcriber. Beza conjectures, that this manuscript might have existed so early as the time of Irenaeus: Wetstein apprehends that it either returned or was first brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> into France; that it is the same copy which Druthmar, an ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPOSITOR\">expositor</a> who lived about the year 840, had seen, and which he observes, was ascribed to St Hilary; and that R. Stephens had given a particular account of it in his edition of the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a> in 1550. It is usually called Stephens's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> manuscript. Mill agrees with F. Simon in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that it was written in the western part of the world by a Latin scribe, and that it is to a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> interpolated and corrupted: he observes that it agrees so much with the Latin Vulgate, as to afford reason for concluding, that it was corrected or formed upon a corrupt and faulty copy of that translation. From this and the Clermont copy of St Paul's Epistles, Beza published his larger Annotations in 1582.\n\nCambyse.

His father was a native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LITCHFIELD\">Litchfield</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFFORDSHIRE\">Staffordshire</a>, who settling in London, became a member of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of paper-stainers, and lived in the Old Bailey. His mother was of the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of Curwen, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WORKINGTON\">Workington</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a>. He was educated first at Christ's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a>, and afterwards at St Paul's school: from thence he was sent, in 1566, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, and entered servitor of Magdalen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>; but being disappointed of a deacon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, he removed to Broadgate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a>, and somewhat more than two years after, to Christ-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, where he was supported by his kind friend and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> Dr Thornton. About this time he was a candidate for a fellowship of All-souls college, but lost it by the intrigues of the Popish party. In 1570, he supplicated the regents of the university to be admitted bachelor of arts; but in this also he miscarried. The following year Mr Camden came to London, where he prosecuted his favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of antiquity, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> of Dr Goodman, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAN\">dean</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a>, by whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> he was made second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of Westminster school in 1575. From the time of his leaving the university to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, he took several journeys to different parts of England, with a view to make observations and collect materials for his Britannia, in which he was now deeply engaged. In 1581 he became intimately acquainted with the learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> Brifton, who was then in England; and in 1586 he published the first edition of his Britannia; a work which, though much enlarged and improved in future editions, was even then esteemed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to its author, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of its country. In 1593 he succeeded to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> mastership of Westminster school on the resignation of Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">Grant</a>. In this office he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till 1597, when he was promoted to be Clarencieux king at arms. In the year 1600 Mr Camden made a tour to the north, as far as Carlisle, accompanied by his friend Mr (afterwards Sir Robert) Cotton. In 1606 he began his correspondence with the celebrated President de Thou, which continued to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of that faithful historian. In the following year he published his last edition of the Britannia, which is that from which the several English translations have been made; and in 1608, he began to digest his materials for a history of the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>. In 1609, after recovering from a dangerous illness, he retired to Chislehurst in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a>, where he continued to spend the summer months during the remainder of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. The first part of his annals of the queen did not appear till the year 1615, and he determined that the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> should not appear till after his death (a). The work was entirely finished in 1617; and from that time he was principally employed in collecting more materials for the further improvement of his Britannia. In 1622, being now upwards of 70, and finding his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> decline apace, he determined to lose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> time in executing his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of founding a history lecture in the university of Oxford. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a> of gift was accordingly transmitted by his friend Mr Heather to Mr Gregory Wheare, who was, by himself, appointed his first professor. He died at Chislehurst in 1623, in the 73rd year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>; and was buried with great solemnity in Westminster <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a> in the south aisle, where a monument of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> marble was erected to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>. Camden was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> and integrity; profoundly learned in the history and antiquities of this kingdom, and a judicious and conscientious historian. He was reverenced and esteemed by the literati of all nations, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be ever remembered as an honour to the age and country wherein he lived. Besides the works already mentioned, he was author of an excellent Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a>, and of several tracts in Hearne's collection. But his great and most useful work, the Britannia, is that upon which his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> chiefly built. The edition above mentioned, to which he put his last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, was correctly printed in folio, much augmented, amended where it was necessary, and adorned with maps. It was first translated into English, and published in folio at London, in 1611, by the laborious Dr Philemon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, a physician of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVENTRY\">Coventry</a>, who is thought to have consulted our author himself; and therefore great respect has been paid to the additions and explanations that occur.\n\n(a) The reign of Queen Elizabeth was so recent when the first volume of the Annals was published, that many of the persons concerned, or their dependents, were still living. It is no wonder, therefore, that the honest historian should offend those whose actions would not bear inquiry. Some of his enemies were clamorous and troublesome; which determined him not to publish the second volume during his life; but that poverty might be in no danger of disappointment, he deposited one copy in the Cotton library, and transmitted another to his friend Dupuy at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>.

It is subject to the Pope, and is about 60 miles in length on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> sea.\n\nIt has been generally thought that the air of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> hath something in it peculiarly noxious during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; but Mr Condamine is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that it is not more unhealthy than any other marshy country. His account follows. \"It was after the invasion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHS\">Goths</a> in the fifth and sixth centuries that this corruption of the air began to manifest itself. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of the Tiber being covered by the accumulated ruins of the edifices of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Rome, could not but raise itself considerably. But what permits us not to doubt of this fact is, that the ancient and well-preserved pavement of the Pantheon and its portico is overflowed every winter; that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> even rises there sometimes to the height of eight or ten feet: and that it is not possible to suppose that the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> should have built a temple in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> so low as to be covered with the waters of the Tiber on the least inundation. It is evident, then, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the bed of this river is raised several feet; which could not have happened without forming there a kind of dikes or bars. The choking up of its canal necessarily occasioned the overflow and reflux of its waters in such places as till then had not been subject to inundations; to these overflows of the Tiber were added all the waters that escaped out of the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-AQUEDUCTS\">aqueducts</a>, the ruins of which are still to be seen, and which were entirely broken and destroyed by Totila. What need, therefore, of anything more to infect the air, in a hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, than the exhalations of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of stagnating waters deprived of any discharge, and become the receptacle of a thousand impurities, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> of several millions both of men and animals? The evil could not but increase from the same causes while Rome was exposed to the incursions and devastations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOMBARDS\">Lombards</a>, the Normans, and the Saracens, which lasted for several centuries. The air became so infectious there at the beginning of the 13th century, that Pope Innocent III. wrote, that few people at Rome arrived to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of forty years, and that nothing was more uncommon there than to see a person of sixty. A very short time after, the popes transferred the seat of their residence to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVIGNON\">Avignon</a>: during the seventy-two years they remained there, Rome became a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a>; the monasteries in it were converted into stables; and Gregory XI. on his return to Rome, in 1376, hardly counted there 30,000 inhabitants. At his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> began the troubles of the great schism in the west, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for upwards of 50 years. Martin V., in whom this schism ended in the year 1429, and his first successors, were able to make but feeble efforts against it to extirpate an evil. It was not till the beginning of the 16th century that Leo X., under whom Rome began to resume her wonted splendour, gave himself some trouble about re-establishing the salubrity of the air; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, being shortly after besieged twice successively by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V., <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> itself plunged again into all its old calamities; and from 85,000 inhabitants, which it contained under Leo X., it was reduced under Clement VIII. to 32,000. In short, it is only since the time of Pius V. and Sextus V., at the end of the 16th century, that the popes have constantly employed the necessary methods for purifying the air of Rome and its environs, by procuring proper discharges for the waters, drying up the humid and marshy grounds, and covering the banks of the Tiber and other places reputed uninhabitable with superb edifices. Since that time a person may dwell at Rome, and go in or out of it at all seasons of the year. At the beginning, however, of the present century, they were still afraid to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> out of the city in summer, when they had resided there; as they were also to return to it, when once they had quitted it. They never ventured to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> at Rome, even in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, in any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> than their own. They are greatly relaxed at present from these ancient scruples: I have seen cardinals, in the months of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> and August, go from Rome to lie at Frascati, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIVOLI\">Tivoli</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBANO\">Albano</a>, &c. and return the next or the following days to the city, without any detriment to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>: I have myself tried all these experiments, without suffering the least inconvenience from them: we have even seen, in the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> in Italy, two armies encamped under the walls of Rome at the time when the heats were most violent. Yet notwithstanding all this, the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the country people dare not still venture to lie during that season of the year, nor even as much as sleep in a carriage, in any part of the territory comprehended under the name of the Campagna of Rome.\"\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMPANIFORM\">Campaniform</a>, or Campanulated, an appellation given to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> resembling a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMPANINI\">Campanini</a>, a name given to an Italian marble dug out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRARA\">Carrara</a>, because, when it is worked, it sounds like a bell.\n\nCampanula, or Bell-flower. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">Botany</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>.\n\nCampbell, Archibald, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> and marquis of Argyle, was the son of Archibald earl of Argyle, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a> Douglas, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of William earl of Morton. He was born in the year 1558; and educated in the profession of the Protestant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, according to the strictest rules of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Scotland, as it was established immediately after the reformation. During the commonwealth he was induced to submit to its authority. Upon the restoration, he was tried for his compliance; a crime <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to him with the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, and such a one as the most loyal and affectionate subject might frequently by violence be induced to commit. To make this compliance appear the more voluntary and hearty, there were produced in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> letters which he had wrote to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBEMARLE\">Albemarle</a>, while that general governed Scotland, and which contained expressions of the most cordial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to the established <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. But, besides the general indignation excited by Albemarle's discovery of this private correspondence, men thought, that even the highest demonstrations of affection might, during jealous times, be exacted as a necessary mark of compliance from a person of such distinction as Argyle; and could not, by any equitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, imply the crime of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a>.\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, however, scrupled not to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> upon him, and he suffered with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a> and courage.\n\nCampbell, Archibald, earl of Argyle, son to the former, had from his youth distinguished himself by his loyalty and his attachment to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>. Though his father was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the covenanters, he himself refused to concur in any of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>; and when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLONEL\">colonel</a> was given him by the convention of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, he forbore to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> upon it till it should be ratified by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>. By his respectful behaviour, as well as by his services, he made himself acceptable to Charles when that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> was in Scotland, and even after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORCESTER\">Worcester</a>, all the misfortunes which attended the royal cause could not engage him to desert it. Under Middleton he obstinately persevered to harass and infest the victorious English; and it was not till he received orders from that general, that he would submit to accept of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a>. Such jealousy of his loyal attachments was entertained by the commonwealth and protector, that a pretence was soon after fallen upon to commit him to prison; and his confinement was rigorously continued till the restoration. The king, sensible of his services, had remitted to him his father's forfeiture, and created him earl of Argyle; and when a most unjust sentence was passed upon him by the Scots parliament, Charles had anew remitted it. In the subsequent part of this reign Argyle behaved himself dutifully; and though he seemed not disposed to go all lengths with the court, he always appeared, even in his opposition, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of mild dispositions and peaceable deportment.\n\nA parliament was summoned at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> in summer 1681, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> was appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSIONER\">commissioner</a>. Besides granting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> to the king, and voting the indefeasible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of succession, this parliament enacted a test, which all persons possessed of offices, civil, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a>, were bound to take. In this test the king's supremacy was asserted, the covenant renounced, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a> obedience attested to, and all obligations disclaimed of endeavouring any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in civil or ecclesiastical establishments. This was the state of the test as proposed by the courtiers; but the country party proposed also a clause of adherence to the Protestant religion, which could not with decency be rejected. The whole was of an enormous length, considered as an oath; and, what was worse, a confession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> was there ratified which had been imposed a little after the reformation, and which contained many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> altogether forged by the parliament and nation. Among others, the doctrine of resistance was inculcated; so that the test being voted in a hurry, was found on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> to be a medley of absurdity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>. Though the courtiers could not reject the clause of adhering to the Protestant religion, they proposed, as a requisite mark of respect, that all princes of the blood should be exempted from taking that oath. This exception was zealously opposed by Argyle; who observed that the sole danger to be dreaded for the Protestant religion must proceed from the perversion of the royal family. By insisting on such topics, he drew on himself the secret indignation of the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, of which he soon felt the fatal consequences.\n\nWhen Argyle took the test as a privy counsellor, he subjoined, in the duke's presence, an explanation which he had beforehand communicated to that prince, and which he believed to have been approved by him. It was in these words. \"I have considered the test, and am very desirous of giving obedience as far as I can. I am confident that the parliament never intended to impose contradictory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a>: therefore I think <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> man can explain it but for himself. Accordingly I take it as far as it is consistent with itself and the Protestant religion. And I do declare that I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> not to bind myself, in my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a>, and in a lawful way, from withstanding and endeavouring any alteration, which I think to the advantage of church or state, and not repugnant to the Protestant religion and my loyalty: and thus I understand as a part of my oath.\" The duke, as was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a>, heard it with great tranquillity: no one took the least offence: Argyle was admitted to sit that day in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>: and it was impossible to imagine that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> offence had been committed where occasion seemed not to have been given so much as for a frown or reprimand.\n\nArgyle was much surprised a few days after, to find that a warrant was issued for committing him to prison; that he was indicted for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> treason, leasemaking, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERJURY\">perjury</a>; and that from the innocent words abovementioned an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a> was extracted, by which he was to forfeit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, honours, and fortune. It is needless to enter into particulars, where the iniquity of the whole is so evidently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>. Though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> was displayed, even her semblance was not put on; and the forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> were preserved to sanctify, or rather aggravate, the oppression. Of five judges, three did not scruple to find the guilt of treason and leasemaking to be incurred by the prisoner: a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a> of 15 noblemen gave verdict against him; and the king being consulted, ordered the sentence to be pronounced, but the execution of it to be suspended till further orders. Argyle, however, saw no reason to trust to the justice or mercy of such enemies: He made his escape from prison, and till he could find a ship for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> he concealed himself during some time in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. The king heard of his lurking place, but would not suffer him to be arrested. All the parts, however, of his sentence, so far as the government in Scotland had power, were rigorously executed; his estate confiscated, his arms reverred and torn. Having got over to Holland, he remained there during the remaining part of the reign of Charles II. But thinking himself at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, before the coronation of James II., to exert himself in order to recover the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> by force of arms, he concerted measures with the duke of Monmouth, and went into Scotland, to assemble his friends: but not meeting with the success he expected, he was taken prisoner; and being carried to Edinburgh, was beheaded upon his former unjust sentence, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 30, 1685. He showed great constancy and courage under his misfortunes: on the day of his death he ate his dinner very cheerfully; and, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, slept after it a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> or more, very soundly. At the place of execution, he made a short, grave, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> speech; and, after solemnly declaring that he forgave all his enemies, submitted to death with great firmness.\n\nCampbell, Archibald, first duke of Argyle, son to the preceding, was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> promoter of the revolution.\nHe came over with the prince of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a>; was admitted into the convention as earl of Argyle, though his father's attainder was not reversed; and in the claim of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> the sentence against him was declared to be, what most certainly it was, a reproach upon the nation. The establishment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> upon the prince and princess of Orange being carried by a great majority in the Scottish convention, the earl was sent from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, with Sir James <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTGOMERY\">Montgomery</a> and Sir John Dalrymple from the barons and boroughs, to offer the crown, in the name of the convention, to their majesties, and tendered them the coronation oath; for which, and many other eminent services, he was admitted a member of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-PRIVY_COUNCIL\">privy council</a>, and, in 1692, made one of the lords of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>. He was afterwards made a colonel of the Scots <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> guards; and, in 1694, one of the extraordinary lords of session. He was likewise created duke of Argyle, marquis of Kintyre and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORN\">Lorn</a>, earl of Campbell and Cowall, Viscount of Lochow and Glenila, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERARY\">Inverary</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULL\">Mull</a>, Morvern, and Terrey, by letters-patent, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENSINGTON\">Kensington</a> the 23rd of June 1701. He sent over a regiment to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a> for King William's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, the officers of which were chiefly of his own name and family, who bravely distinguished themselves through the whole course of the war. He married <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, daughter of Sir Lionel Talmath of Helmingham in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUFFOLK\">Suffolk</a>, by Elizabeth duchess of Lauderdale his wife, daughter and heiress of William Murray earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol8.html#article-DYSART\">Dysart</a>, by whom he left three sons and a daughter; namely, John duke of Argyle, the subject of the next article; Archibald, who succeeded his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> as duke of Argyle; and Lady Anne, married to James Stuart, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> earl of Bute, by whom she had a son afterwards earl of Bute.\n\nCampbell, John, second duke of Argyle, and also duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">baron</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHATHAM\">Chatham</a>, son to the subject of the preceding article, was born on the 10th of October 1680; and, on the very day when his grandfather suffered at Edinburgh, fell out of a window three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of stairs high without receiving any hurt. At the age of 15, he had made a considerable progress in classical learning. His father then perceived and encouraged his military disposition, and introduced him to King William, who appointed him to the command of a regiment. In this situation he remained till the death of his father in 1703; when becoming duke of Argyle, he was soon after sworn of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> Anne's privy council, made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a> of the Scotch horse guards, and appointed one of the extraordinary lords of session. In 1704, her majesty reviving the Scottish order of the thistle, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> was installed one of the knights of that order, and was soon after appointed high-commissioner to the Scotch parliament; where, being of great service in promoting the intended union, he was on his return created a peer of England, by the titles of baron of Chatham and earl of Greenwich, and in 1710 was made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARTER\">garter</a>. His grace first distinguished himself in his military capacity at the battle of Oudenarde; where he commanded as brigadier-general, with all the bravery of youth and the conduct of a veteran officer. He was present under the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARLBOROUGH\">Marlborough</a> at the siege of Ghent, and took possession of the town. He had also a considerable share in the victory obtained over the French at the battle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALPLAQUET\">Malplaquet</a>, by dislodging them from the wood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SART\">Sart</a>, and gaining a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>. In this sharp engagement, several musket-balls passed through the duke's clothes, hat, and periwig. Soon after this hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, he was sent to take the command in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>; and after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of Port <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAHON\">Mahon</a>, he returned to England. His grace having now a seat in the house of lords, he censured the measures of the ministry with such freedom, that all his places were disputed of to other noblemen: but at the accession of George I. he recovered his influence. At the breaking out of the rebellion in 1715, he was made commander-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of his majesty's forces in North <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>; and was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> means and cause of the total extinction, at that time, of the rebellion in Scotland, without much bloodshed. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> opposition to him, or that part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> he commanded, at the head of all his Campbells was placed Campbell earl of Braidalbin, of the same family and kindred, by some fatal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> that ever misguided and misled that unhappy family of the Stuarts and all its adherents. The consequence was, that both sets of Campbells, from family affection, refused to strike a stroke, and retired out of the battle. He arrived at London <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 6th 1716, and was in high favour: but, to the surprize of people of all ranks, he was in a few months divested of all his employments; and from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> to the year 1718, he signalized himself in a civil capacity, by his uncorrupted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a> and manly eloquence. In the beginning of the year 1719, he was again admitted into favour, appointed lord-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEWARD\">steward</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a>, and in April following was created duke of Greenwich. He continued in the administration during all the remaining part of that reign; and, after his late majesty's accession, till April 1740; when he delivered a speech with such warmth, that the ministry being highly offended, he was again dismissed from his employments. To these, however, on the change of the ministry, he was soon restored; but not approving of the measures of the new ministry more than those of the old, he gave up all his posts for the last time, and never after engaged in affairs of state. He now enjoyed privacy and retirement; and died of a paralytic disorder on the 4th of October 1743. To the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of his grace a very noble monument was erected in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">Abbey</a>, executed by the ingenious Roubillac.\n\nThe duke of Argyle, though never first minister, was a very able statesman and politician, most steadily fixed in those principles he believed to be right, and not to be shaken or changed. His delicacy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> were so great, that it hurt him to be even suspected; witness that application said to be made to him by one of the adherents of the Stuart family before the last rebellion in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, which was considerable both in Scotland and England. He immediately sent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to the secretary of state; and it vexed him much even to have an application made him, lest any person should think him capable of acting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> part. When he thought measures wrong or corrupt, he cared not who was the author, however great or powerful he might be; witness his boldly attacking the great duke of Marlborough in the house of lords, about his forage and army contracts in Flanders, in the very zenith of his power and popularity.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a> popularity, though in all other respects he was the most able general of his time. The duke of Argyle on all occasions spoke well, with a firm, manly, and noble eloquence; and seems to deserve the character given of him by Pope:\n\nArgyle the state's whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> born to wield,\nAnd thake alike the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> and the field.\n\nIn private life, the duke's conduct was highly exemplary. He was an affectionate husband and an indulgent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>. He seldom parted with his servants till age had rendered them incapable of their employments; and then he made provision for their subsistence. He was liberal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, and particularly to persons of merit in distress: but though he was ready to patronize deserving persons, he was extremely cautious not to deceive any by lavish promises or leading them to form vain expectations. He was a strict economist, and paid his tradesmen punctually every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>; and though he maintained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, he took care that no part of his income should be wasted in empty pomp or unnecessary expenses. He was twice married; and left five daughters, but no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>. The titles of duke and earl of Greenwich and baron of Chatham became extinct at his death; but in his other titles he was succeeded by his brother Archibald earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-ILA\">Ila</a>, the subject of the next article.\n\nCampbell, Archibald, third duke of Argyle, brother to the subject of the preceding article, was born at Hambrook, in England, in June 1682, and was educated at the university of Glasgow. He afterwards applied himself to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the law at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UTRECHT\">Utrecht</a>; but, upon his father's being created a duke, he betook himself to a military life, and served some time under the duke of Marlborough. Upon quitting the army, in which he did not long remain, he applied to the acquisition of that knowledge which would enable him to make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> world. In 1705, he was constituted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a> of Scotland, and made a considerable figure in parliament, though he was not more than 23 years of age. In 1706, he was appointed one of the commissioners for treating of the Union; and the same year was created Lord Orontay, Dunoon, and Arrois, Viscount and Earl of Ila. In 1708, he was made an extraordinary lord of session; and when the Union was effected, he was chosen one of the Sixteen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEERS\">Peers</a> for Scotland, in the first parliament of Great-Britain; and was constantly elected to every future parliament till his death, except the fourth. In 1710, he was made justice-general of Scotland. In 1711, he was called to the privy council; and upon the accession of George I, he was nominated lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> of Scotland. When the rebellion broke out in 1715, he again betook himself to arms, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the house of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANOVER\">Hanover</a>, and by his prudent conduct in the West Highlands, he prevented General Gordon at the head of three thousand men, from penetrating into the country and raising levies. He afterwards joined his brother at Stirling, and was wounded at the battle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUMBARTON\">Dumbarton</a>. In 1725, he was appointed keeper of the privy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>; and from this time, he was entrusted with the management of Scottish affairs. In 1734, upon his resigning the privy seal, he was made keeper of the great seal, which office he enjoyed till his death. Upon the decease of his brother, he became Campbell, duke of Argyle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> justice-general, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSARY\">commissary</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARGYLESHIRE\">Argyleshire</a> and the Western Isles, hereditary great master of the household, hereditary keeper of Dunstaffnage, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRICK\">Carrick</a>, and several other castles. He was also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> of the university of Aberdeen; and laboured to promote the interest of that, as well as of the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> of Scotland. He particularly encouraged the school of physic at Edinburgh, which has now acquired so high a reputation. Having the chief management of Scotch affairs, he was also extremely attentive to promote the trade, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>, and improvements of his country. It was by his advice that, after the rebellion in 1745, the Highlanders were employed in the royal army. He was a man of great endowments both natural and acquired, well versed in the laws of his country, and possessed considerable parliamentary abilities. He was likewise eminent for his skill in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, had great talents for conversation, and had collected one of the most valuable private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LIBRARIES\">libraries</a> in Great Britain. He built himself a very magnificent seat at Inverary. The faculties of his mind continued found and vigorous till his death, which happened suddenly on the 15th of April 1761, in the 90th year of his age. He was married, but had no issue; and was succeeded in his titles and the estates of the family by John Campbell, fourth duke of Argyle, son of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> John Campbell of Mammor, who was the second son of Archibald the ninth earl of Argyle.\n\nThe family of Argyle was heritable justice generals for Scotland till abolished by the jurisdiction act. They are still heritable masters of the king's household in Scotland, and keepers of Dunstaffnage and Carrick.\n\nCampbell, John, an eminent historical, biographical, and political writer, was born at Edinburgh, March 8, 1727-8. His father, Robert Campbell of Glenlyon, Esq.; was captain of horse in a regiment commanded by the then earl of Hyndford; and his mother, Elizabeth, daughter of \u2014\u2014Smith, Esq.; of Windfor in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERKSHIRE\">Berkshire</a>, had the honour of claiming a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> from the poet Waller. Our author, their fourth son, was at the age of five years carried from Scotland to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINDSOR\">Windsor</a>, where he received the first principles of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>; and at a proper age, he was placed out as clerk to an attorney, being intended for the law. This profession, however, he never followed; but by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> application to the acquisition of knowledge of various kinds, became qualified to appear with great advantage in the literary world. In 1736, before he had completed his 30th year, he gave to the public, in two volumes folio, \"The Military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of Prince Eugene and the duke of Marlborough,\" enriched with maps, plans, and cuts. The reputation hence acquired, occasioned him soon after to be solicited to take a part in the \"Ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> History.\" Whilst employed in this capital <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, Mr Campbell found leisure to entertain the world with other productions. In 1739, he published the \"Travels and Adventures of Edward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">Brown</a>, Esq;\" 8vo. In the same year appeared his \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the Balhaw Duke de Ripperda,\" 8vo, reprinted, with improvements, in 1740. These memoirs were followed,\nCampbell followed, in 1741, by the \"Concise History of Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>,\" 8vo. In 1742, he was the author of \"A Letter to a Friend in the Country, on the Publication of Thurlow's State Papers; giving an account of their discovery, importance, and utility.\" The same year was distinguished by the appearance of the 1st and 2d volumes of his \"Lives of the English Admirals, and other eminent British Seamen.\" The two remaining volumes were completed in 1744; and the whole, not long after, was translated into German. This was the first of Mr Campbell's works to which he prefixed his name; and it is a performance of great and acknowledged merit. In 1743, he published \"Herminius revived;\" a second edition of which, much improved and enlarged, came out in 1749, under the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>: \"Herminius Redivivus: or, the Sage's Triumph over Old Age and the Grave. Wherein a method is laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> for prolonging the life and vigour of man. Including a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMENTARY\">Commentary</a> upon an ancient Inscription, in which this great secret is revealed; supported by numerous authorities. The whole interspersed with a great variety of remarkable and well-attested relations.\" This extraordinary tract had its origin in a foreign publication; but it was wrought up to perfection by the additional ingenuity and learning of Mr Campbell. In 1744 he gave to the public, in two volumes folio, his \"Voyages and Travels,\" on Dr Harris's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, being a very distinguished improvement of that collection which had appeared in 1735. The time and care employed by Mr Campbell in this important undertaking did not prevent his engaging in another great work, the \"Biographia Britannica,\" which began to be published in weekly numbers in 1745, and extended to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> volumes folio; but our author's articles were only in the first four volumes; of which Dr Kippis observes, they constitute the prime merit.\n\nWhen the late Mr Dodfey formed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of \"The Preceptor,\" which appeared in 1748, Mr Campbell was to assist in the undertaking; and the parts written by him were the Introduction to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">Chronology</a>, and the Discourse on Trade and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">Commerce</a>, both of which displayed an extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> of knowledge upon these subjects. In 1750 he published the first separate edition of his \"Present State of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>;\" a work which had been originally begun in 1746, in the \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a>,\" a very valuable periodical performance, printed for Dodfey. There is no production of our author's that hath met with a better reception. It has gone through six editions, and fully deserved this encouragement. The next great undertaking which called for the exertion of our author's abilities and learning, was \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">Modern</a> Universal History.\" This extensive work was published, from time to time, in detached parts, till it amounted to 16 volumes folio; and a second edition of it, in 8vo, began to make its appearance in 1759. The parts of it written by Mr Campbell were, the histories of the Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish, French, Swedish, Danish, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OSTEND\">Ostend</a> Settlements in the East-Indies; and the Histories of the Kingdoms of Spain, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, Algarve, Navarre, and that of France, from Clovis to 1656. As our author had thus distinguished himself in the literary world, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of LL.D. was very properly and honourably conferred upon him, June 18, 1754, by the university of Glasgow.\n\nHis principal and favourite work was, \"A political Survey of Great Britain,\" 2 vol. 4to, published a short time before his death; in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of his knowledge, and his patriotic spirit, are equally conspicuous. Dr Campbell's reputation was not confined to his own country, but extended to the remotest parts of Europe. As a striking instance of this, it may be mentioned, that in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> of 1774, the empress of Russia was pleased to honour him with the present of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>, drawn in the robes worn in that country in the days of John Basilowicz, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> duke of Muscovy, who was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> with Queen Elizabeth. To manifest the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of her imperial majesty's goodneds, a set of the \"Political Survey of Britain,\" bound in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOROCCO\">Morocco</a>, highly ornamented, and accompanied with a letter descriptive of the triumphs and felicities of her reign, was forwarded to St Petersburg, and conveyed into her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> by Prince Orloff, who had resided some months in this kingdom.\n\nDr Campbell in 1736 married Elizabeth, daughter of Benjamin Vobe, of Leominster, in the county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEREFORD\">Hereford</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, with whom he lived nearly 40 years in the greatest conjugal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>. So wholly did he dedicate his time to books, that he seldom went abroad: but to relieve himself as much as possible from the inconveniences incident to a sedentary life, it was his custom, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> would admit, to walk in his garden; or otherwise in some room of his house, by way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>. By this method, united with the strictest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a> in eating, and an equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a> in drinking, he enjoyed a good state of health, though his constitution was delicate. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> manner of living did not preclude him from a very extensive and honourable acquaintance. His house, especially on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a> evening, was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> of the most distinguished persons of all ranks, and particularly of such as had rendered themselves eminent by their knowledge or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of literature. He received foreigners, who were fond of learning, with an affability and kindness which excited in them the highest respect and veneration; and his instructive and cheerful conversation made him the delight of his friends in general. He was, during the latter part of his life, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> for the province of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEORGIA\">Georgia</a> in North America; and died at the close of the year 1775, in the 67th year of his age. The doctor's literary knowledge was by no means confined to the subjects on which he more particularly treated as an author; he was well acquainted with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, and had read much in medicine. It hath been with great reason believed, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he had dedicated his studies to this last science, he would have made a very conspicuous figure in the medical profession. He was eminently versed in the different parts of sacred literature; and his acquaintance with the languages extended not only to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a>, Greek and Latin among the ancient, and to the French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch, among the modern; but likewise to the Oriental tongues. He was particularly fond of the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. His attainment of such a variety of knowledge was exceedingly assisted by a memory surprisingly retentive, and which indeed afforded\nCampbell, wished every person with whom he was conversant. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, he had an uncommon readiness and facility; and the style of his works, which had been formed upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of that of the celebrated Bishop Sprat, was perspicuous, easy, flowing, and harmonious. To all these accomplishments of the understanding, Dr Campbell joined the more important virtues of a moral and pious character. His disposition was gentle and humane, and his manners kind and obliging. He was the tenderest of husbands, a most indulgent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a>, a kind master, a firm and sincere friend. To his great Creator he paid the constant and ardent tribute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>, duty, and reverence; and in his correspondences he showed that a sense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> was always nearest his heart.\n\nCampbell, George, D.D. was born at Aberdeen in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1719. He was educated at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a> school in the same town, and intended for the employment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIGNET\">signet</a>-writer, an occupation similar to that of an English attorney, in which he was bound an apprentice. The love of study, however, prevailed over every opposition: in 1741 he attended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> lectures at Edinburgh before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPRENTICESHIP\">apprenticeship</a> was fully completed, and soon after became a regular student in the university of Aberdeen, attending the lectures of Professor Lumiden in King's, and Professor Chalmers in Marischal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>. In 1746 he was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Aberdeen. In 1748 he obtained the living of Banchory Ternan, in which situation he became a married man, and was fortunate in possessing a lady \"remarkable for the sagacity of her understanding, the integrity of her heart, the general propriety of her conduct, and her skill in the management of domestic economy.\" Mutual happiness was the consequence of this union, which was not terminated till her death in 1792. In 1757 he was translated to Aberdeen, to be one of the ministers of that town, and in 1759 was presented to the office of principal of Marischal college.\n\nMr Hume's Treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">Miracles</a> gave the new principal an opportunity of evincing that he was not unworthy of his office. He opposed it in a sermon preached before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNOD\">synod</a> of Aberdeen, in 1762, which he was requested to publish; but he preferred the form of a dissertation, and in that state sent the manuscript to Dr Blair, to be by him communicated to the metaphysician. Availing himself then of the remarks of his friends, and his opponent, he gave it to the world in 1763, with a dedication to Lord Bute: but however desirable the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> of the minister might be in other respects, it was of very little assistance in giving circulation, in the literary world, to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> which, from the favourable impressions of Blair and Hume, was eagerly read, and universally admired.\n\nIn 1771 he was elected professor of divinity in Marischal college, on which he resigned his office as one of the ministers of Aberdeen: but as \"minister of Gray Friars, an office conjoined to the professorship about a century ago, he was obliged to preach once every Sunday in one of the established churches.\" Few persons seem to have entertained truer notions of the office of a teacher in an university than our new professor; and the plan he had in view, on entering upon his lectures, though expressed in rather too strong language, may be recommended to every one who undertakes a similar employment.\n\n\"Gentlemen, (he thus addresses his pupils) the nature of my office has been much misunderstood. It is supposed, that I am to teach you everything connected with the study of divinity. I tell you honestly, that I am to teach you nothing. Ye are not school-boys. Ye are young men, who have finished your courses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, and ye are no longer to be treated as if ye were at school. Therefore, I repeat it, I am to teach you nothing; but, by the grace of God, I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> assist you to teach yourselves everything.\" In 1771 he published his excellent sermon on the Spirit of the Gospel; and, in 1776, his Philosophy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">Rhetoric</a>. In this latter year, also, he acquired the friendship of Dr Tucker by a sermon, then much admired, and very generally read, on the Duty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">Allegiance</a>, in which he endeavours to show \"that the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> in America had no right, either from reason or from scripture, to throw off their allegiance;\" and he uses those vulgar arguments, which, as being purely political, and more especially adapted to the sentiments of the majority of that day, were very improper topics for the pulpit. It is so much the fashion for divines to make the varying politics of the hour the subject of their discourses, and in them to follow the sentiments of those whose patronage is deemed most advantageous, that we must not be very severe in our animadversions on the present occasion. In 1777 he chose a better subject for a discourse, which he published at the request of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> for propagating Christian Knowledge, and in which the success of the first publishers of the Gospel is ably treated as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. In 1779, when many of his countrymen, led away by the madness of enthusiasm and fanaticism, were rushing headlong into the most antichristian practice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a>, he published a very reasonable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> to the people of Scotland, on the alarms which had been raised by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> in favour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMAN_CATHOLICS\">Roman Catholics</a>.\n\nIn the same year, also, he published a sermon on the Happy Influence of Religion on Civil Society. The last work which he lived to bring before the public was his Translation of the Four Gospels, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> dissertations, and explanatory notes, of which it is unnecessary to say anything farther in this place than that it is worthy of his talents and character.\n\nIn 1795 he resigned his professorship, in a letter to the moderator of the presbytery of Aberdeen, which they voted to be inserted in their records. Soon after the resignation of his professorship, he resigned also the principalship, on a pension of \u00a3300 a-year being conferred on him by government; but this pension he possessed for a very short time, for, on the 31st of March, 1796, his last illness seized him, and on the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> it was followed by a paroxysm of the palsy, which destroyed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of speech, and under which he languished till he died. His funeral sermon was preached on the 17th of April by Dr Brown, who had succeeded him in the offices of principal and professor.\n\nHis character, very justly drawn by the same gentleman, we shall now lay before our readers. \"Dr Campbell, as a public teacher, was long admired for the clearness and copiousness with which he illustrated...\"\ned the great doctrines and precepts of religion, and the strength and energy with which he enforced them. Intimately persuaded of the truth and infinite consequence of what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a> teaches, he was strongly dexterous in carrying the same conviction to the minds of his hearers, and delivered his discourses with that zeal which flows from strong impressions, and that power of persuasion which is the result of sincerity of heart, combined with clearness of understanding. He was satisfied, that the more the pure dictates of the gospel were studied, the more they would approve themselves to the mind, and bring forth, in the affections and conduct, all the peaceable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of righteousness. The unadulterated dictates of Christianity, he was, therefore, only studious to recommend and inculcate; and knew perfectly to discriminate them from the inventions and traditions of men. His chief study ever was, to direct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> to the great objects of practice; and, without these, he viewed the most orthodox profession as \"a sounding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, and a tinkling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CYMBAL\">cymbal</a>.\" But, besides the character of a preacher of righteousness, he had also that of a teacher of the science of divinity to sustain. How admirably he discharged this duty, and with what effect he conveyed the soundest and most profitable instruction to the minds of his scholars, let those declare who are now in various congregations of this country, communicating to their fellow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> the fruits of their studies under so able and judicious a teacher. Discarding all attachment to human systems, merely considered as such, he tied his faith to the Word of God alone, possessed the happiest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> in investigating its meaning, and communicated to his hearers the result of his own inquiries, with a precision and perspicuity which brought <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> out of obscurity, and rendered clear and simple what appeared intricate and perplexed. He exposed, without reserve, the corruptions which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, craft, and hypocrisy, had introduced into religion, and applied his talent for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> to the best of all purposes, to hold up to contempt the absurdities with which the purest and sublimest truths had been loaded.\n\nPlaced at the head of a public seminary of learning, he felt all the importance of such a situation, and uniformly directed his influence to public utility. His enlarged and enlightened mind justly appreciated the extensive consequence of the education of youth. He anticipated all the effects resulting to the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> of mankind, from numbers of young men issuing, in regular succession, from the university over which he presided, and occupying the different departments of social life.\n\nHis benevolent heart delighted to represent itself the students under his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> usefully and honourably discharging the respective duties of their different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a>; and some of them, perhaps, filling the most distinguished stations of civil society. With these prospects before him, he constantly directed his public conduct to their attainment. He never suffered his judgment to be warped by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> or partiality, or his heart to be seduced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> or private interest. Those mean and ignoble motives by which many are actuated in the discharge of important trusts, approached not his mind. A certain honourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a>, if pride it may be called, diffused an uniform dignity over the whole of his behaviour. He felt the man degraded by the perversion of public character. His understanding also clearly shewed him even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> advantage attached to such principles and practice, as he adopted from a sense of obligation, and those elevated conceptions of real worth which were so congenial to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>. He saw, he experienced, esteem, respect, and influence, following in the train of integrity and beneficence; but contempt, disgrace, aversion, and complete insignificance, closely linked to corruption and selfishness. Little minds are seduced and overpowered by selfish considerations, because they have not the capacity to look beyond the present advantage, and to extend to the misery that stands on the other side of it. The same circumstance that betrays the perversity of their hearts, also evinces the weakness of their judgments.\n\nHis reputation as a writer is as extensive as the present intercourse of letters; not confined to his own country, but spread through every civilized nation. In his literary pursuits, he aimed not, as is very often the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, with men of distinguished literary abilities, merely to establish his own celebrity, or increase his fortune; but had chiefly at heart the defence of the great cause of Religion, or the elucidation of her dictates.\n\nAt an early period he entered the lists as a champion for Christianity against one of its acutest opponents. He not only triumphantly refuted his arguments, but even conciliated his respect by the handsome and dexterous manner in which his defence was conducted. While he refuted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDEL\">infidel</a>, he spared the man, and exhibited the uncommon spectacle of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLEMICAL\">polemical</a> writer possessing all the moderation of a Christian. But while he defended Christianity against its enemies, he was desirous of contributing his endeavours to increase, among its professors, the knowledge of the sacred writings. Accordingly, in the latter part of his life, he favoured the world with a work, the fruit of copious erudition, of unwearied application for almost thirty years, and of a clear and comprehensive judgment. We have only to regret, that the other writings of the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a> have not been elucidated by the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> that translated the Gospels. Nor were his literary merits confined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>, and the studies more immediately connected with it. Philosophy, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FINE_ARTS\">fine arts</a>, are also indebted to his genius and labours; and in him the polite scholar was eminently joined to the deep and liberal divine.\n\nPolitical principles will always be much affected by general character. This was also the case with Dr Campbell. In politics, he maintained that moderation which is the surest criterion of truth and rectitude, and was equally distant from those extremes into which men are so apt to run in great political questions. He cherished that patriotism which consists in willing, and endeavouring to promote, the greatest happiness of his country, and is always subordinate to universal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>. Firmly attached to the British constitution, he was animated with that genuine love of liberty which it inspires and invigorates. He was equally averse to despotism and to popular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a>; the two evils into which political parties are so frequently hurried, to the destruction of all that is valuable to government. Party-spirit, of whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, he considered as having an unhappy tendency to pervert, to the most pernicious purposes, the best principles of the human mind,\nCampbelltown, a parliament town of Argyleshire in Scotland, seated on the eastern shore of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> of Kintyre or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTYRE\">Cantyre</a>, of which it is the capital. It hath a good harbour; and is now a very considerable place, though within these 50 years only a petty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> town. It has in fact been created by the fishery; for it was appointed the place of rendezvous for the bullocks; and above 260 have been seen in the harbour at once. The inhabitants are reckoned to be upwards of 8000 in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>. W. Long. 5. 10. N. Lat. 54.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMPDEN\">Campden</a>, a small town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLOUCESTERSHIRE\">Gloucestershire</a> in England, containing about 200 houses. It gives title of Viscount, by courtesy, to the earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAINSBOROUGH\">Gainsborough</a> his son. W. Long. 1. 50. N. Lat. 52.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMPEACHY\">Campeachy</a>, a town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a> in South America, seated on the east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of the same name, on the west of the province of Yucatano. It is defended by a good wall and strong forts; but is neither so rich, nor carries on such a trade, as formerly; it having been the port for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of logwood, the place where it is cut being about 30 miles distant. It was taken by the English in 1596; by the buccaneers in 1678; and by the Flibusters of St Domingo in 1685, who set it on fire and blew up the citadel. W. Long. 93. 7. N. Lat. 19. 20.\n\nCampeachy-Wood. See Hematoxylum, Botany Index.\n\nCampen, a strong town of Overijssel in the United Provinces. It hath a citadel and a harbour; but the latter is almost choked up with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>. It was taken by the Dutch in 1578, and by the French in 1672; but they abandoned it the following year. It is seated near the mouth of the river Yssel and Zuider Zee. E. Long. 5. 35. N. Lat. 52. 38.\n\nCampestre, in antiquity, a sort of cover for the privities, worn by the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> in their field exercises; being girt under the navel, and hanging down to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a>. The name is supposed to be formed from campus, the field or place where the Roman soldiers performed their exercises.\n\nCamphora, or Camphire, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> concrete substance extracted from the wood of the laurus camphora. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MATERIA_MEDICA\">Materia Medica</a> Index.\n\nPure camphire is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, pellucid, somewhat unctuous to the touch; of a bitterish aromatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, yet accompanied with a sense of coolness; of a very fragrant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, somewhat like that of rosemary, but much stronger. It has been very long esteemed one of the most efficacious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAPHORETICS\">diaphoretics</a>; and has been celebrated in fevers, malignant and epidemical distempers. In deliria, also, where opiates could not procure sleep, but rather aggravated the symptoms, this medicine has often been observed to procure it. All these effects, however, Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a> attributes to its sedative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, and denies that camphire has any other medicinal virtues than those of an antispasmodic and sedative. He camphire allows it to be very powerful, and capable of doing much good or much harm. From experiments made on different brute creatures, camphire appears to be poisonous to every one of them. In some it produced sleep followed by death, without any other symptom. In others, before death, they were awakened into convulsions and rage. It seems, too, to act chiefly on the stomach; for an entire piece swallowed, produced the above-mentioned effects with very little diminution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>.\n\nCamphuysen, Dirk Theodore Raphael, an eminent painter, was born at Gorcum in 1586. He learned the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> from Diederick Govertze; and by a studious application to it, he very soon not only equalled, but far surpassed his master. He had an uncommon genius, and studied nature with care, judgment, and assiduity. His subjects were landscapes, mostly small, with ruined buildings, kuts of peasants or views of villages on the banks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, with boats and boys, and generally he represented them by moonlight. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> is remarkably tender and soft, his colouring true nature and very transparent, and his expertise in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a> is seen in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> distances of his objects, which are excellently contrived, and have a surprising degree of nature and truth. As he left off painting at an age when others are scarcely qualified to commence artists, few of his works are to be met with, and they bring considerable prices; as they cannot but give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> to the eye of every observer. He painted his pictures with a thin body of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, but they are handled with singular neatness and spirit. He practised in his profession only till he was 18 years of age; and being then recommended as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> to the sons of the lord of Nieuport, he undertook the employment, and discharged it with so much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, that he was appointed secretary to that nobleman. He excelled in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> with a pen; and the designs which he finished in that manner are exceedingly valued.\n\nCampian, Edmund, an English Jesuit, was born at London, of indigent parents, in the year 1540; and educated at Christ's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a>, where he had the honour to speak an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORATION\">oration</a> before Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> on her accession to the throne. He was admitted a scholar of St John's college in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> at its foundation, and took the degree of master of arts in 1564. About the same time he was ordained by a bishop of the church of England, and became an eloquent Protestant preacher. In 1566, when Queen Elizabeth was entertained by the university of Oxford, he spoke an elegant oration before her majesty, and was also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESPONDENT\">respondent</a> in the philosophy act in St Mary's church. In 1568, he was junior proctor of the university. In the following year, he went over to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, where he wrote a history of that kingdom, and turned papist; but being found rather too affluous in persuading others to follow his example, he was committed to prison. He soon, however, found means to make his escape. He landed in England in 1571; and thence proceeded to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUAY\">Douay</a> in Flanders, where he publicly recanted his former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a>, and was created bachelor of divinity. He went soon after to Rome, where, in 1573, he was admitted of the society of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a>, and was sent by the general of that order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>, where he wrote his tragedy called...\nCampian led *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECTAR\">Nectar</a> et ambrosia*, which was acted before the emperor with great applause.\n\nFrom Vienna he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAGUE\">Prague</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a>, where he resided in the Jesuits college about six years, and then returned to Rome. From thence, in 1580, he was sent by Pope Gregory XIII. with the celebrated Father Parsons, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the people of England. From Pitts we learn, that some time before, several English priests, inspired by the Holy Ghost, had undertaken to convert their countrymen; that so of these foreign seminaries, besides several others who by God's grace had been converted in England, were actually engaged in the pious work with great success; that some of them had suffered imprisonment, chains, tortures, and ignominious death, with becoming constancy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>: but seeing at last that the labour was abundant and the labourers few, they solicited the assistance of the Jesuits; requesting, that though not early in the morning, they would at least in the third, fifth, or ninth hour, send labourers into the Lord's vineyard. In consequence of this solicitation, the above two were sent to England. They arrived in an evil hour for Campian, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a>; and were next day joyfully received by their friends at London. He had not been long in England, before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALSINGHAM\">Walsingham</a> the secretary of state, being informed of his uncommon affluency in the cause of the church of Rome, used every means in his power to have him apprehended, but for a long time without success. However, he was at last taken by one Elliot, a noted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>-taker, who found him in the house of Edward Yates, Esq.; at Lyford in Berkshire, and conducted him in triumph to London, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on his hat, on which was written *Campian the Jesuit*. He was imprisoned in the Tower; where, Wood says, \"he did undergo many examinations, abuses, wrackings, tortures;\" *exquisitissimus cruciatus tortus*, says Pitts. It is hoped, for the credit of our reformers, this torturing part of the story is not true. The poor wretch, however, was condemned, on the statute 25 Ed. III. for high treason; and butchered at Tyburn, with two or three of his fraternity. Howsoever criminal in the eye of the law, or of the English gospel, might be the zeal of this Jesuit for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a> of the poor heretics of this kingdom, biographers of each persuasion unite in giving him a great and amiable character. \"All writers (says the Oxford antiquary), whether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a> or Popish, say, that he was a man of admirable parts; an elegant orator, a subtle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> and disputant, and an exact preacher whether in English or the Latin tongue, of a sweet disposition, and a well-polished man.\" Fuller, in his church-history, says, \"he was of a sweet nature, constantly carrying about him the charms of a plausible behaviour, of a fluent tongue, and good parts.\" His History of Ireland, in two books, was written in 1570; and published, by Sir James <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WARE\">Ware</a>, from a manuscript in the Cotton library, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>, 1633, folio.

The irreverence of Ham towards his father <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOAH\">Noah</a> is recorded in Gen. ix. Upon that occasion the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a> cursed him in a branch of his posterity: \"Curfed,\" says he, be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANAAN\">Canaan</a>; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> of servants shall he be unto his brethren.\" This curse being pronounced, not against Ham the immediate transgressor, but against his son, who does not appear, from the words of Moses, to have been any ways concerned in the crime, hath occasioned several conjectures. Some have believed that Noah cursed Canaan, because he could not well have cursed Ham himself, whom God had not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before blessed. Others think Moses's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> intent in recording this prediction was to raise the spirits of the Israelites, then entering on a terrible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with the children of Canaan, by the assurance, that, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the curse, that people were destined by God to be subdued by them. For the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of those who imagine all Ham's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> were here accursed, seems repugnant to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> words of Scripture, which confines the malediction to Canaan and his posterity; and is also contrary to fact. Indeed, the prophecy of Noah, that Canaan \"should be a servant of servants to his brethren,\" seems to have been wholly completed in him. It was completed with regard to Shem, not only in that a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> nations of the Canaanites were made slaves to the Israelites, when they took possession of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, as part of the remainder of them were afterwards enslaved by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a>; but also by the subsequent expeditions of the Assyrians and Persians, who were both defeated from Shem; and under whom the Canaanites suffered subjection, as well as the Israelites; not to mention the conquest of part of Canaan by the Elamites, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Persians, under Chedorlaomer, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to them all. With regard to Japhet, we find a completion of the prophecy, in the successive conquests of the Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a> and Phoenicia, where the Canaanites were settled; but especially in the total subversion of the Carthaginian power by the Romans; besides some invasions of the northern nations, as the posterity of Thogarma and Magog; wherein many of them, probably, were carried away captive.\n\nThe posterity of Canaan were very numerous. His eldest son was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIDON\">Sidon</a>, who at least founded and peopled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Sidon, and was the father of the Sidonians and Phoenicians. Canaan had besides ten sons, who were the fathers of so many peoples, dwelling in Palestine, and in part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>; namely, the Hittites, the Jebuites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and Hamathites.\n\nLand of CANAAN, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> so named from Canaan the son of Ham. It lies between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, and extends from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> to Phoenicia. It is bounded to the east by the mountains of Arabia; to the south by the wilderness of Paran, Idumea, and Egypt; to the west by the Mediterranean, called in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> the Great sea; to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> by the mountains of Libanus. Its length from the city of Dan (since called Caesarea Philippi, or Paneadis, which stands at the foot of these mountains) to Beer-sheba, is about 70 leagues; and its breadth from the Mediterranean sea to the eastern borders, is in some places 30. This country, which was first called Canaan, from Canaan the son of Ham, whose posterity possessed it, was afterwards called Palestine, from the people which the Hebrews call <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILISTINES\">Philistines</a>, and the Greeks and Romans corruptly Palestinians, who inhabited the sea coasts, and were first known to them. It likewise had the name of the Land of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">Promise</a>, from the promise God made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a> of giving it to him; that of the Land of Israel, from the Israelites having made themselves masters of it; that of Judah, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of Judah, which was the most considerable of the twelve; and lastly, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> it had of being sanctified by the presence, actions, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ, has given it the name of the Holy Land, which it retains to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>.\n\nThe first inhabitants of this land therefore were the Canaanites, who were descended from Canaan, and the eleven sons of that patriarch. Here they multiplied extremely; trade and war were their first occupations; these gave rise to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, and the several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> scattered by them over almost all the illands and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> provinces of the Mediterranean. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of their idolatry and abominations was completed, when God delivered their country into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the Israelites. In St Athanasius's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, the Africans still said they were descended from the Canaanites; and it is said, that the Punic tongue was almost entirely the same with the Canaanitish and Hebrew <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. The colonies which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CADMUS\">Cadmus</a> carried into Thebes in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOEOTIA\">Boeotia</a>, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Cilix into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CILICIA\">Cilicia</a>, came from the stock of Canaan. The isles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDINIA\">Sardinia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a>, Cyprus, Corfu, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJORCA\">Majorca</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINORCA\">Minorca</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GADES\">Gades</a> and Ebusus, are thought to have been peopled by the Canaanites. Bochart, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> entitled Canaan, has set all this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> in a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>.\n\nMany of the old inhabitants of the north-west of the land of Canaan, however, particularly on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> or territories of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRE\">Tyre</a> and Sidon, were not driven out by the children of Israel, whence this tract seems to have retained the name of Canaan a great while after\nthose other parts of the country, which were better inhabited by the Israelites, had lost the said name. The Greeks called this tract inhabited by the old Canaanites along the Mediterranean sea, Phoenicia; the more inland parts, as being inhabited partly by Canaanites, and partly by Syrians, Syrophoenician: and hence the woman said by St Matthew (xv. 22.) to be a woman of Canaan, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> Jesus cured, is said by St Mark (vii. 26.) to be a Syrophoenician by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, as she was a Greek by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and language.","sp":117,"ep":118},{"h":"CANABAC","t":"an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> which lies contiguous to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BULAM\">Bulam</a> on the western <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, and is inhabited by a fierce people, governed by two kings <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> chiefs.

Under the name of Canada, the French comprehended a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> territory; taking into their claim <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of New Scotland, New England, and New York on the east; and extending it on the west as far as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PACIFIC_OCEAN\">Pacific ocean</a>. That part, however, which was reduced by the British arms in the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, lies between 61\u00b0 and 81\u00b0 degrees of west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>, and between 45\u00b0 and 52\u00b0 of north latitude. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> is not very different from that of the northern British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>; but as it is much further from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and more to the northward, than most of those provinces, it has a much severer winter, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is generally clear; and, like most of those American tracts that do not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> too far to the northward, the summers are very hot, and exceeding pleasant. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> in general is very good, and in many parts extremely fertile; producing many different sorts of grains, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, and vegetables. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a> grounds, which are well watered, yield excellent grass, and breed vast numbers of great and small cattle. The uncultivated parts are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> wood, composed of prodigiously large and lofty trees, of which there is such a variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, that even of those who have taken most pains to know them, there is not perhaps one that can tell half the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>. Canada produces, among others, two sorts of pines, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>; four sorts of firs; two sorts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEDAR\">cedar</a> and oak, the white and the red; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> maple; three sorts of ash trees, the free, the mungrel, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASTARD\">bastard</a>; three sorts of walnut-trees, the hard, the soft, and the smooth; vast numbers of beech-trees and white wood; white and red elms, and poplars. The Indians hollow the red elms into canoes, some of which made out of one piece <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> contain 20 persons; others are made of the bark; the different pieces of which they sew together with the inner rind, and daub over the seams with pitch, or rather a bituminous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> resembling pitch, to prevent their leaking; the ribs of these canoes are made of boughs of trees. In the hollow elms, the bears and wild cats take up their lodging from November to April. The country produces also a vast variety of other vegetables, particularly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>, which thrives well. Near Quebec is a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> mine, and many excellent ones of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> have been discovered. It hath also been reported that silver is found in some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> are extremely numerous, and many of them very large and deep. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> are, the Ouattauais, St John's, Seguinay, Defpaires, and Trois Rivi\u00e8res; but all these are swallowed up by the great river St Lawrence. This river flows from the lake <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ONTARIO\">Ontario</a>; and, taking its course north-east, washes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTREAL\">Montreal</a>, where it receives the Ouattauais, and forms many fertile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>. It continues the same course, and meets the tide upwards of 400 miles from the sea, where it is navigable for large vessels; and below Quebec, 320 miles from the sea, it becomes so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> and so deep, that ships of the line contributed in the last war to reduce that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>. After receiving in its progress innumerable streams, it at last falls into the ocean at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> Roiliers, where it is 90 miles broad, and where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> is intense and the sea boisterous. This river is the only one upon which any settlements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> are as yet formed; but it is very probable, that, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to come, Canada, and those vast regions to the west, may be enabled of themselves to carry on a considerable trade upon the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a> of fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> which these countries environ. Here are five lakes, the least of which is of greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> than the fresh-water lakes to be found in any other part of the world: these are the lake Ontario, which is not less than 200 leagues in circumference; Erie, or Owegoo, longer, but not so broad, is about the same extent. That of the Huron spreads greatly in width, and is about 300 leagues in circuit; as also is that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MICHIGAN\">Michigan</a>, though like lake Erie it is rather <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, and comparatively narrow. But the lake Superior is larger than any of these, being not less than 500 leagues in circumference. All these are navigable by any vessels, and they all communicate with each other; but the passage between Erie and Ontario is interrupted by a most stupendous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> or cataract, called the falls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NIAGARA\">Niagara</a>*. The river St Lawrence, *See Nia- as already observed, is the outlet of these lakes, by gara, which they discharge themselves into the ocean. The French built forts at these several straits, by which the lakes communicate with one another, and on that where the last of them communicates with the river. By these, while the country was in their possession, they effectually secured to themselves the trade of the lakes, and preserved an influence over all the Indian nations that lie near them.\n\nThe most curious and interesting part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of Canada is the animals there produced. These are flags, elks, deer, bears, foxes, martins, wild cats, ferrets, weasels, large squirrels of a greyish hue, hares and rabbits. The southern parts, in particular, breed great numbers of wild bulls, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> sorts of roebucks, goats, wolves, &c. The marshes, lakes, and pools, with which this country abounds, swarm with otters and beavers, of which the white are highly valued, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> kind. A vast variety of birds are also to be found in the woods; and the river St Lawrence abounds with such quantities of fish, that it is affirmed by some writers, this would be a more profitable article than even the fur-trade.\u2014There are\nin Canada a multitude of different Indian tribes; but these are observed to decrease in number where the Europeans are most numerous; owing chiefly to the immoderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of spirituous liquors, of which they are excessively fond. Their manners and way of living we have already particularly described. The principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> are Quebec, Trois Rivieres, and Montreal. The commodities required by the Canadians from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> are, wine, or rather rum; cloths, chiefly coarse; linens, and wrought iron. The Indian trade requires rum, tobacco, a fort of duffil blankets, guns, powder, balls, and flints, kettles, hatchets, toys, and trinkets of all kinds. While the country was in possession of the French, the Indians supplied them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a>; and the French had traders, who, like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> inhabitants, traversed the vast lakes and rivers in canoes, with incredible industry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>, carrying their goods into the remotest parts of America, and among nations entirely unknown to us. These again brought the furs, &c., home to them, as the Indians were thereby habituated to trade with them. For this purpose, people from all parts, even from the distance of 1000 miles, came to the French fair at Montreal, which began in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, and sometimes lasted three months. On this occasion many solemnities were observed, guards were placed, and the governor assisted to preserve order in so great and various a concourse of savage nations. But sometimes great disorders and tumults happened; and the Indians frequently gave for a dram all that they were possessed of. It is remarkable, that many of these nations actually passed by the English settlement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBANY\">Albany</a> in New York, and travelled 200 miles further to Montreal, though they could have purchased the goods they wanted cheaper at the former.\n\nSince <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> became possessed of Canada, our trade with that country has generally employed 34 ships and 400 seamen; their exports, at an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> of three years, in skins, furs, ginflong, snake-root, capillaire, and wheat, amount to 150,000l. Their imports from Great Britain are computed at nearly the same sum. It will, however, be almost impossible to overcome certain inconveniences arising from the violence of the winter. This is so excessive from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> to April, that the broadest rivers are frozen over, and the snow lies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> from four to six feet deep on the ground, even in those parts of the country which lie three degrees south of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, and in the temperate latitude of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>. Another inconvenience arises from the falls in the river St Lawrence below Montreal, which prevent ships from penetrating to that emporium of inland <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>. Our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> therefore with Canada, and the immense regions beyond it, will always be interrupted during the winter-season, until <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> are formed that can be travelled without danger from the Indians. For these savage people often commit hostilities against us, without any previous notice; and frequently, without any provocation, they commit the most horrid ravages for a long time with impunity.\n\nCanada was undoubtedly discovered by Sebastian Cabot, the famous Italian adventurer, who sailed under a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> from Henry VII. But though the English monarch did not think proper to make any use of this discovery, the French quickly attempted it; we have an account of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> for cod on the banks of Newfoundland, and along the sea-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Canada, in the beginning of the 16th century. About the year 1506, one Denys, a Frenchman, drew a map of the gulf of St Lawrence; and two years after, one Aubert, a ship-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of Dieppe, carried over to France some of the natives of Canada. As the new country, however, did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> the same amazing quantities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> and silver produced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a>, the French for some years neglected the discovery. At last, in the year 1523, Francis I, a sensible and enterprising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, sent four ships, under the command of Verazani, a Florentine, to prosecute discoveries in that country. The particulars of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s first expedition are not known. All we can learn is, that he returned to France, and next year he undertook a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>. As he approached the coast, he met with a violent storm; however, he came so near as to perceive the natives on the shore, making friendly signs to him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>. This being found impracticable by reason of the surf upon the coast, one of the sailors threw himself into the sea; but, endeavouring to swim back to the ship, a surge threw him on shore without signs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. He was, however, treated by the natives with such care and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, that he recovered his strength, and was allowed to swim back to the ship, which immediately returned to France. This is all we know of Verazani's second expedition. He undertook a third, but was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more heard of, and it is thought that he and all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> perished before he could form any colony. In 1534, one Jacques Cartier of St Malo set sail under a commission from the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, and on the 10th of May arrived at Cape <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONAVISTA\">Bonavista</a> in Newfoundland. He had with him two small ships besides the one in which he sailed. He cruised along the coast of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, on which he discovered inhabitants, probably the Eskimos. He landed in several places along the coast of the gulf, and took possession of the country in the king's name. On his return, he was again sent out with a commission, and a pretty large force; he returned in 1535, and passed the winter at St Croix; but the season proved so severe, that he and his companions must have died of the fever, had they not, by the advice of the natives, made use of the decoction of the tops and bark of the white pines. As Cartier, however, could produce neither gold nor silver, all that he could lay about the utility of the settlement was disregarded; and in 1540, he was obliged to become pilot to one M. Roberval, who was by the French king appointed viceroy of Canada, and who sailed from France with five vessels. Arriving at the gulf of St Lawrence, they built a fort; and Cartier was left to command the garrison in it, while Roberval returned to France for additional recruits to his new settlement. At last, having embarked in 1549, with a great number of adventurers, neither he nor any of his followers were heard of more.\n\nThis fatal accident so greatly discouraged the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of France, that, for 50 years, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> were taken for supplying with necessaries the settlers that were left. At last, Henry IV, appointed the marquis de la Roche <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a>-general of Canada and the neighbouring countries. In 1588 he landed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of Sable, which he ably thought to be a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> for a settlement, though it was without any port, and without produce except briars. Here he left about 40 malefactors, the refuse of the French jails. After cruising\nfor some time on the coast of Nova Scotia, without being able to relieve these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> wretches, he returned to France, where he died of a broken heart. His colony must have perished, had not a French ship been wrecked on the island, and a few sheep driven upon it at the same time. With the boards of the ship they erected huts; and while the sheep lasted they lived on them, feeding afterwards on fish. Their clothes wearing out, they made coats of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>-skins; and in this miserable condition they spent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years, when Henry ordered them to be brought to France. The king had the curiosity to see them in their seal-skin dresses, and was so moved with their appearance, that he forgave them all their offences, and gave each of them 50 crowns to begin the world anew.\n\nIn 1602, one Chauvin, a commander in the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>, attended by a merchant of St Malo, called Pontgrave, made a voyage to Canada, from whence he returned with a very profitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of furs. Next year he repeated the voyage with the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a>, but died while he was preparing for a third. The many specimens of profit to be made by the Canadian trade, at last induced the public to think favourably of it. An armament was equipped, and the command of it given to Pontgrave, with powers to extend his discoveries up the river St Lawrence. He failed in 1603, having in his company Samuel Champlain, who had been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a> in the navy, and was a man of parts and spirit. It was not, however, till the year 1608, that the colony was fully established. This was accomplished by founding the city of Quebec, which from that time commenced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of all the settlements in Canada. The colony, however, for many years continued in a low way, and was often in danger of being totally exterminated by the Indians. As the particulars of these wars, however, could neither be entertaining, nor indeed intelligible, to many of our readers, we choose to omit them, and in general observe, that the French not only concluded a permanent peace with the Indians, but so much ingratiated themselves with them, that they could with the greatest ease prevail upon them at any time to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> and scalp the English in their settlements. These practices had a considerable share in bringing about the last war with France, when the whole country was conquered by the British in 1761. The most remarkable transaction in this conquest was the siege of Quebec; for a particular account of which, see that article. And for the transactions here during the late American war, see America (United <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a> of).\n\nCANAL of Communication, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> cut in the ground, supplied with water from rivers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>, &c., in order to make a navigable communication betwixt one place and another.\n\nThe particular operations necessary for making artificial navigations depend upon a number of circumstances. The situation of the ground; the vicinity or connection with rivers; the ease or difficulty with which a proper quantity of water can be obtained; these and many other circumstances necessarily produce great variety in the structure of artificial navigations, and augment or diminish the labour and expense of executing them. When the ground is naturally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>, and unconnected with rivers, the execution is easy, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> is not liable to be disturbed by floods; but, when the ground rises and falls, and cannot be reduced to a level, artificial methods of raising and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a> vessels must be employed; which likewise vary according to circumstances.\n\nA kind of temporary sluices are sometimes employed for raising boats over falls or shoals in rivers by a very simple operation. Two posts or pillars of masonry-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, with grooves, are fixed, one on each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of the river, at some distance below the shoal. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> having passed these posts, planks are let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> across the river by pulleys into the grooves, by which the water is dammed up to a proper height for allowing the boat to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> up the river over the shoal.\n\nThe Dutch and Flemings at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> sometimes, when obstructed by calcades, form an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCLINED_PLANE\">inclined <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> or rolling-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> upon dry land, along which their vessels are drawn from the river below the calcade into the river above it. This, it is said, was the only method employed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, and is still used by the Chinese, who are said to be entirely ignorant of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and utility of locks. These rolling-bridges consist of a number of cylindrical rollers which turn easily on pivots, and a mill is commonly built near by, so that the same machinery may serve the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> purpose of working the mill and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> up vessels.\n\nA Lock is a basin placed lengthwise in a river or canal, lined with walls of masonry on each side, and terminated by two gates, placed where there is a calcade or natural fall of the country; and so constructed, that the basin being filled with water by an upper sluice to the level of the waters above, a vessel may ascend through the upper gate; or the water in the lock being reduced to the level of the water at the bottom of the calcade, the vessel may descend through the lower gate; for when the waters are brought to a level on either side, the gate on that side may be easily opened. But, as the lower gate is strained in proportion to the depth of water it supports, when the perpendicular height of the water exceeds 12 or 13 feet, more locks than one become necessary. Thus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the fall be 17 feet, two locks are required, each having 8\u00bd feet fall; and if the fall be 26 feet, three locks are necessary, each having 8 feet 8 inches fall. The side-walls of a lock ought to be very strong. Where the natural foundation is bad, they should be founded on piles and platforms of wood: they should likewise slope outwards, in order to resist the pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> from behind.\n\nPlate CXXXIV. fig. 1.

The first (X) prevents the water of the superior canal from falling into the lock; and the second (Y) dams up and retains\nCanal. stains the water in the lock. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>-gates ought to be very strong, and to turn freely upon their hinges. In order to make them open and shut with ease, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> is furnished with a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a> $A_b$, $A_c$, $C_b$. They should be made very tight and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>, that as little water as possible may be lost.\n\nBy the subterraneous passage $G H$ (fig. 2, 3, &c.) which descends obliquely, by opening the sluice $G$, the water is let down from the superior canal $D$ into the lock, where it stops and retained by the gate $C$ when shut, till the water in the lock comes to be on a level with the water in the superior canal $D$; as represented, fig. 3. When, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the water contained by the lock is to be let out, the passage $G H$ must be shut by letting down the sluice $G$; the gate $A$ must be also shut, and the passage $K F$ opened by raising the sluice $K$: a free passage being thus given to the water, it descends through $K F$, into the inferior canal, until the water in the lock is on a level with the water in the inferior canal $B$; as represented, fig. 2.\n\nNow, let it be required to raise the vessel $L$ (fig. 2) from the inferior canal $B$ to the superior one $D$; if the lock happens to be full of water, the sluice $G$ must be shut, and also the gate $A$, and the sluice $K$ opened, so that the water in the lock may run out till it is on a level with the water in the inferior canal $B$. When the water in the lock comes to be on a level with the water at $B$, the leaves of the gate $C$ are opened by the levers $C_b$, which is easily performed, the water on each side of the gate being in equilibrium; the vessel then falls into the lock. After this the gate $C$ and the sluice $K$ are shut, and the sluice $G$ opened, in order to fill the lock, till the water in the lock, and consequently the vessel, be upon a level with the water in the superior canal $D$; as is represented in fig. 3. The gate $A$ is then opened, and the vessel passes into the canal $D$.\n\nAgain, let it be required to make a vessel descend from the canal $D$ into the inferior canal $B$. If the lock is empty, as in fig. 2, the gate $C$ and sluice $K$ must be shut, and the upper sluice $G$ opened, so that the water in the lock may rise to a level with the water in the upper canal $D$. Then open the gate $A$, and let the vessel pass through into the lock. Shut the gate $A$ and the sluice $G$; then open the sluice $K$, till the water in the lock be on a level with the water in the inferior canal; then the gate $C$ is opened, and the vessel passes along into the canal $B$, as was required.\n\nScarcity of water becomes a very serious inconvenience to navigation in those places where locks are necessary, as, without a sufficient supply, it must be frequently interrupted. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> water, therefore, has been an important consideration in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of locks. Various attempts have been made for this purpose. We shall here give an account of one which has been proposed by Mr Playfair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a> in London. \"The nature and principle of this manner of saving water, says the inventor, consists in letting the water which has served to raise or fall a boat or barge from the lock, pass into reservoirs or cisterns, whose apertures of communication with the lock are upon different levels, and which may be placed or constructed at the side or sides of the lock with which they communicate, or in any other contiguous situation that circumstances may render eligible; which apertures may be opened or shut at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, so that the water may pass from the lock to each reservoir of the canal, or from each reservoir to the lock, in the following manner: The water which fills the lock, when a boat is to ascend or descend, instead of being passed immediately into the lower part of the canal, is let pass into the cisterns or reservoirs, upon different levels; then, their communications with the lock being shut, they remain full until another vessel is wanted to pass; then, again, the cisterns are emptied into the lock, which is thereby nearly filled, so that only the remainder which is not filled is supplied from the higher part of the canal. Each of these cisterns must have a surface not less than that of the lock, and must contain half as much water as is meant to be expended for the passage of each vessel. The cistern the most elevated is placed twice its own depth (measuring by the aperture, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> opening of the cistern) under the level of the water in the higher part of the canal. The second cistern is placed once its own depth under the first, and so on are the others, to the lowest; which last is placed once its own depth above the level of the water in the lower part of the canal. The apertures of the intermediate cisterns, whatever their number may be, must all be equally divided into different levels; the surface of the water in the one being always on the level of the bottom of the aperture of the cistern which is immediately above. As an example of the manner and rule for constructing these cisterns, suppose that a lock is to be constructed twelve feet deep, that is, that the vessel may ascend or descend twelve feet in passing. Suppose the lock sixty feet long and five feet wide, the quantity of water required to fill the lock, and to pass a boat, is 4320 cubic feet; and suppose that, in calculating the quantity of water that can be procured for supplying the canal, after allowing for waste, it is found (according to the number of boats that may be expected to pass) that there will not be above 800 cubic feet for each; then it will be necessary to save five-sixths of the whole quantity that in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> would be necessary: to do which ten cisterns must be made (the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of placing which is expressed in the drawing, fig. 5, Plate CXXXIV.), each of which must be one foot deep, or deeper at pleasure, and each must have a surface of 360 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, equal to the surface of the lock. The bottom of the aperture of the lowest cistern must be placed one foot above the level of the water in the lower part of the canal, or eleven feet under the level of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> water; the second cistern must be two feet above the level of the low water; the third three feet, and so on of the others; the bottom of the tenth, or uppermost cistern, being ten feet above the low water, and two feet lower than the high water; and, as each cistern must be twelve inches in depth, the surface of the water in the higher cistern will be one foot under the level of the water in the upper part of the canal. The cisterns being thus constructed, when the lock is full, and the boat to be let down, the communications between the lock and the cisterns, which until then have all been shut, are to be opened in the following manner; first, the communication with the higher cistern is opened, which, being at bottom two feet under the level of the water in the lock,\nlock, is filled to the depth of one foot, the water in the lock descending one foot also at the same time; that communication is then shut, and the communication between the lock and the second cistern is opened; one foot more of the water then passes into that cistern from the lock, and fills it; the opening is then shut: the same is done with the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth cisterns, one by one, until they are all filled; and, when the tenth, or lowermost cistern, is filled, there remains but two feet depth of water in the lock. The communication between the lock and the lower part of the canal is then opened, and the last two feet depth of water is emptied into the lower part of the canal. By this means, it is evident, that, instead of twelve feet depth of water being let descend into the lower part of the canal, there is only two feet depth that descends, or one-sixth of the whole; therefore, instead of 4320 cubic feet being used, there are only 720 cubic feet used: the remainder of the water in the cisterns being used as follows. When another boat is to mount, the sluices being then shut, and the boat in the lock, the tenth or lowermost cistern is emptied into the lock, which it fills one foot; the communication being then shut, the next lowest cistern, or the ninth, is emptied into the lock, which is thereby filled another foot; and so, in like manner, all the other cisterns are emptied one after another, until the higher cistern being emptied, which fills the tenth foot of water in the lock, there remains but two feet of water to fill, which is done from the upper part of the canal, by opening the higher sluice to pass the boat; by that means, the same quantity of water descends from the upper part of the canal into the lock, that in the other case descended from the lock into the lower part of the canal; so that, in both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the same quantity of water is saved, that is, five-sixths of what would be necessary were there no cisterns. Suppose again that, upon the same canal, and immediately after the twelve feet lock, it would be advantageous to construct one of eighteen feet; then, in order not to use any greater quantity of water, it will be necessary to have fifteen cisterns, upon different levels, communicating with the lock in the same manner. Should, again, a lock of only six feet be wanted, after that of eighteen, then it will only be necessary to have four cisterns on different levels, and so of any other height of lock. The rule is this: for finding the number and size of the cisterns, each cistern being the same in superficiality with the lock, its depth must be such as to contain one half the quantity of water meant to be used in the passing of one boat. The depth of the lock, divided by the depth necessary for such a cistern, will give, in all cases, the whole number of cisterns, and two more: deduct the number two, therefore, from the number which you find by dividing the depth of the lock by the depth of one cistern, and you have always the number of cisterns required; which are to be placed upon different levels, according to the rule already given. The above is the principle and manner of using the lock, for saving water in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>, and for enabling engineers to construct locks of different depths upon the same canal, without using more water for the deep locks than for the shallow ones. With regard to the manner of disposing the cisterns, the circumstances of the ground, the declivity, &c. will be the best guide for the engineer.\n\nBut even when water is abundant, if the declivity of a country be such as to require numerous locks, navigation suffers great interruption from them. A method by which boats could be raised and lowered with greater facility, or in a shorter time than can be done by means of locks is still a very desirable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of improvement in inland navigation. For this purpose the inclined plane has been often resorted to, and particularly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>, where water-carriage is more generally employed than in any country of Europe. But this method requires very powerful machinery or a great number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, which has prevented it from being much practised in this country. Other contrivances to obviate the use of locks have been proposed. Dr Anderson, in his Agricultural Survey of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">County</a> of Aberdeen, has described one, of which we shall give an account in his own words. This contrivance, he observes, \"in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of very good judges of matters of this sort, to whom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> has been shown, has been deemed fully adequate to the purpose of raising and lowering boats of a moderate size, that is, of 20 tons, or downwards; and it is the opinion of most men with whom I have conversed, who are best acquainted with the inland navigations, that a boat of from 10 to 15 tons is better than those of a larger size. When several are wanted to be sent at once, they may be affixed to one another, as many as the towing-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> can conveniently draw. Were boats of this size adopted, and were all the boats on one canal to be of the same dimensions, it would prove a great convenience to a country in a state of beginning improvements; because the expense of such a boat would be so trifling, that every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> could have one for himself, and might of course make use of it when he pleased, by the aid of his own horse, without being obliged to have any dependence on the time that might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> the convenience of his neighbour; and if two or more boats were going from the same neighbourhood, one horse could serve the whole.\n\n\"You are to suppose that fig. 6. Plate CXXXIV. represents a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a>'s-eye view of this simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>, as seen from above. A is supposed to be the upper reach of the canal, and B the lower reach, with the apparatus between the two. This consists of three divisions; the middle one, extending from C to D, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> piece of masonry, raised from a firm foundation below the level of the bottom of the second reach; this is again divided into five parts, viz. d'd', where the wall rises only to the height of the water in the upper reach, and e'e', two pillars, raised high enough to support the pivots of a wheel or pulley g, placed in the position there marked.\n\n\"The second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> b consists of a wooden coffer, of the same depth nearly as the water in the upper reach, and of a size exactly fitted to contain one of the boats. This communicates directly with the upper reach, and being upon the same plane with it, and so connected with it as to be water-tight, it is evident, from inspection, that nothing can be more easy than to float a boat into this coffer from the upper reach, the part of the wheel that projects over it being at a sufficient height above it, so as to occasion no sort of interruption.\n\n\"Third\nThird division. At \\( i \\) is represented another coffer, precisely of the same dimensions with the first. But here two sluices, which were open in the former, and only represented by dotted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, are supposed to be shut, so as to cut off all communication between the water in the canal and that in the coffer. As it was impossible to represent this part of the apparatus on so small a scale, for the sake of illustration it is represented more at large in fig. 9, where \\( A \\), as before, represents the upper reach of the canal, and \\( b \\) one of the coffers. The sluice \\( k \\) goes into two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a> of wood, joined to the masonry of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAM\">dam</a> of the canal, so as to fit perfectly close; and the sluice \\( f \\) fits, exactly close, into cheeks made in the side of the coffer for that purpose; between these two sluices is a small space \\( o \\). The coffer, and this division \\( o \\), are to be supposed full of water, and it will be easy to see that these sluices may be let down, or drawn up at pleasure, with much facility.\n\nFig. 10. represents a perpendicular section of these parts in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> as in fig. 9, and in which the same letters represent the same parts.\n\nThings being thus arranged, you are to suppose the coffer \\( b \\) to be suspended, by means of a chain passed over the pulley, and balanced by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> that is sufficient to counterpoise it, suspended at the opposite end of the chain. Suppose, then, that the counterpoise be made somewhat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> than the coffer with its contents, and that the line \\( m n \\) (fig. 10.) represents a division between the solid sides of the dam of separation, which terminates the upper reach, and the wooden coffer, which had been closed only by the pressure of its own weight (being pushed a very little from \\( A \\) towards \\( B \\), beyond its precise perpendicular swing), and that the joining all round is covered with laths of cloth put upon it for that purpose; it is evident that, so long as the coffer is suspended to this height, the joining must be watertight; but no sooner is it lowered down a little than this joining opens, the water in the small division \\( o \\) is allowed to run out, and an entire separation is made between the fixed dam and this moveable coffer, which may be lowered down at pleasure without losing any part of the water it contained.\n\nSuppose the coffer now perfectly detached, turn to fig. 7., which represents a perpendicular section of this apparatus, in the direction of the dotted line \\( p p \\) (fig. 6.). In fig. 7., \\( b \\) represents an end view of the coffer, indicated by the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> as in fig. 6., suspended by its chain, and now perfectly detached from all other objects, and balanced by a counterpoise \\( i \\), which is another coffer exactly of the same size, as low down as the level of the lower reach. From inspection only it is evident, that, in proportion as the one of these weights rises, the other must descend. For the present, then, suppose that the coffer \\( b \\) is by some means rendered more weighty than \\( i \\); it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> it will descend while the other rises; and they will thus continue till \\( b \\) comes down to the level of the lower reach, and \\( i \\) rises to the level of the higher one.\n\nFig. 8. represents a section in the direction \\( <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a> \\) (fig. 6.), in which the coffer \\( i \\) (seen in both situations) is supposed to have been gradually raised from the level of the lower reach \\( B \\), to that of the higher one where it now remains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>; while the coffer \\( b \\) (which is concealed behind the masonry) has descended in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time to the level of the lower reach, where it closes by means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a> \\( r s \\), fig. 10. (which juncture is covered with laths of cloth, as before explained at \\( m n \\), and is of course become water-tight.) When, by lifting the sluice \\( t \\), and the corresponding sluice at the end of the canal, a perfect communication by water is established between them. If, then, instead of water only, this coffer had contained a boat, floated into it from the upper reach, and then lowered down, it is very plain, that when these sluices were removed, after it had reached the level of the lower reach, that boat might have been floated out of the coffer with as much facility as it was let into it above. Here then we have a boat taken from the higher into the lower canal; and, by reverting this movement, it is very obvious that it might be, with equal ease, raised from the lower into the higher one. It now only remains that I should explain by what means the equilibrium between these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a>-balancing weights can be destroyed at pleasure, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of course produced.\n\nIt is very evident, that if the two corresponding coffers be precisely of the same dimensions, their weight will be exactly the same when they are both filled to the same depth of water. It is equally plain, that should a boat be floated into either or both of them, whatever its dimensions or weight may be, so that it can be contained afloat in the coffer, the weight of the coffer and its contents will continue precisely the same as when it was filled with water only: hence, then, supposing one boat is to be lowered, or one to be raised at a time, or supposing one to be raised and another lowered at the same time\u2014they remain perfectly in equilibrium in either place, till it is your pleasure to destroy that equilibrium. Suppose, then, for the present, that both coffers are loaded with a boat in each, the double sluices both above and below closed; and suppose also that a stop-cock \\( u \\), in the under edge of the side of the lower coffer (fig. 8. and 10.), is opened, some of the water which served to float the boat in the coffer will flow out of it, and consequently that coffer will become lighter than the higher one; the upper coffer will of course descend, while the other mounts upwards. When a gentle motion has been thus communicated, it may be prevented from accelerating, merely by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the stop-cock so as to prevent the loss of more water, and thus one coffer will continue to ascend, and the other to descend, till they have assumed their stations respectively; when, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of a stop below, and another above, they are rendered stationary at the level of the respective canals (\\( A \\)).\n\nPrecisely the same effect will be produced when the coffers are filled entirely with water.\n\nIt is unnecessary to add more to this explanation, except to observe, that the space for the coffer to descend into must be deeper than the bottom of the lower canal,\n\n(a) \"It does not seem necessary to adopt any other contrivance than the above for regulating the motions; but if it should be found necessary, it would be easy to put a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATCH\">ratch</a>-wheel on the same axle.\"\ncanal, in order to allow a free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> for the coffer to the requisite depth; and of course it will be necessary to have a small conduit to allow the water to get out of it. Two or three inches free, below the bottom of the canal, is all that would be necessary.\n\n\"Where the height is inconsiderable, there will be no occasion for providing any counterpoise for the chain, as that will give only a small addition to the weight of the undermost coffer, so as to make it preponderate, in circumstances where the two coffers would otherwise be in perfect equilibrium: but, where the height is considerable, there will be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> for providing such a counterpoise; as, without it, the chain, by becoming more weighty every foot it descended, would tend to destroy the equilibrium too much, and accelerate the motion to an inconvenient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against this inconvenience, let a chain of the same weight, per foot, be appended at the bottom of each coffer, of such a length as to reach within a few yards of the ground where the coffer is at its greatest height (see fig. 7); it will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> with its whole weight upon the highest coffer while in this position; but, as that gradually descended, the chain would reach the ground, and, being there supported, its weight would be diminished in proportion to its descent; while the weight of the chain on the opposite side, would be augmented in the same proportion, so as to counterpoise each other exactly, in every situation, until the uppermost chain was raised from the ground. After which it would increase its weight no more: and, of course, would then give the under coffer that preponderance which is necessary for preserving the machine steady. The under coffer, when it reached its lowest position, would touch the bottom on its edges, which would then support it, and keep everything in the same position, till it was made lighter for the purpose of ascending.\n\n\"What constitutes one particular excellence of the apparatus here proposed is, that it is not only unlimited as to the extent of the rise or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a> of which it is susceptible (for it would not require the expenditure of one drop more water to lower it 100 feet than one foot); but it would also be easy to augment the number of pulleys at any one place as to admit of two, three, four, or any greater number of boats being lowered or elevated at the same time; so that let the succession of boats on such a canal be nearly as rapid as that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a> upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HIGHWAY\">highway</a>, none of them need be delayed one moment to wait an opportunity of paling: a thing that is totally impracticable where water-locks are employed; for the intercourse, on every canal constructed with water-locks, is necessarily limited to a certain degree, beyond which it is impossible to force it.\n\n\"For example: suppose a hundred boats are following each other, in such a rapid succession as to be only half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> behind each other: By the apparatus here proposed, they would all be elevated precisely as they came; in the other, let it be supposed that the lock is so well constructed as that it takes no more than five minutes to close and open it; that is, ten minutes in the whole to each boat (for the lock, being once filled, must be again emptied before it can receive another in the same direction): at this rate, six boats only could be passed in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, and of course it would take fifteen hours and forty minutes to pass the whole hundred; and as the last boat would reach the lock in the space of fifty minutes after the first, it would be detained fifteen hours and fifty minutes before its turn would come to be raised. This is an immense detention; but if a succession of boats, at the same rate, were to follow continually, they never could pass at all. In short, in a canal constructed with water-locks, not more than six boats, on an average, can be passed in an hour, so that beyond that extent all commerce must be stopped; but, on the plan here proposed, sixty, or fix hundred, might be passed in an hour, if necessary, so as to occasion no sort of interruption whatever. These are advantages of a very important nature, and ought not to be overlooked in a commercial country.\n\n\"This apparatus might be employed for innumerable other uses as a moving power, which it would be foreign to our present purpose here to specify. Nor does its power admit of any limitation, but that of the strength of the chain, and of the coffers which are to support the weights. All the other parts admit of being made so immovably firm as to be capable of supporting almost any assignable weight.\n\n\"I will not enlarge on the benefits that may be derived from this very simple apparatus: its cheapness, when compared with any other mode of raising and lowering vessels that has ever yet been practised, is very obvious; and when it is considered that a boat might be raised or lowered fifty feet nearly with the same ease as five, it is evident that the interruptions which arise from frequent locks would be avoided, and an immense saving be made in the original expense of the canal, and in the annual repairs.\n\n\"It is also evident, that an apparatus, on the same principle, might be easily applied for raising coals or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> from a great depth in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>, wherever a very small stream of water could be commanded, and where the mine was level-free.\"\n\nIt is almost needless to spend time in enumerating the many advantages which necessarily result from artificial navigations. Their utility is now so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>, that most nations in Europe give the highest encouragement to undertakings of this kind wherever they are practicable. The advantages of navigable canals did not escape the observation of the ancients. From the most early accounts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> we read of attempts to cut through large isthmuses, in order to make a communication by water, either between different nations, or distant parts of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, where land-carriage was long and expensive. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a> relates, that the Cnidians, a people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARIA\">Caria</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASIA_MINOR\"><a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a>, designed to cut the isthmus which joins that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> to the continent; but were superstitious enough to give up the undertaking, because they were interdicted by an oracle. Several kings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> attempted to join the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RED_SEA\">Red Sea</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> by a canal. It was begun by Necos the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a> Metius, and completed by Ptolemy II. After his reign it was neglected, till it was opened in 635 under the caliphate of Omar, but was again allowed to fall into disrepair; so that it is now difficult to discover any traces of it. Both the Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> intended to make a canal across the isthmus of Corinth, which joins the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOREA\">Morea</a> and Achaia, in order to make a navigable passage by the Ionian Sea into the Archipelago. Demetrius,\nCanals.\n\nCanals, Julius Caesar, Caligula, and Nero, made several unsuccessful efforts to open this passage. But, as the ancients were entirely ignorant of the use of waterlocks, their whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> was employed in making level cuts, which is probably the principal reason why they so often failed in their attempts. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLEMAGNE\">Charlemagne</a> formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of joining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a> and the Danube, in order to make a communication between the ocean and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK_SEA\">Black Sea</a>, by a canal from the river Almutz which discharges itself into the Danube, to the Reditz, which falls into the Main, and this last falls into the Rhine near Mayence; for this purpose he employed a prodigious number of workmen; but he met with so many obstructions from different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, that he was obliged to give up the attempt.\n\nThe French at present have many fine canals: that of Briare was begun under Henry IV. and finished under the direction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Richelieu in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIII. This canal makes a communication betwixt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOIRE\">Loire</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEINE\">Seine</a> by the river Loing. It extends 11 French great leagues from Briare to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTARGIS\">Montargis</a>. It enters the Loire a little above Briare, and terminates in the Loing at Cepoi. There are 42 locks on this canal.\n\nThe canal of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a>, for making another communication between the Seine and the Loire, was begun in 1675, and finished by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> of Orleans, regent of France, during the minority of Louis XV. and is furnished with 20 locks. It goes by the name of the canal of Orleans; but it begins at the village of Combleux, which is a short French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> from the town of Orleans.\n\nBut the greatest and most useful work of this kind is the junction of the ocean with the Mediterranean by the canal of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUEDOC\">Languedoc</a>. It was proposed in the reigns of Francis I. and Henry IV. and was undertaken and finished under Louis XIV. It begins with a large reservoir 4000 paces in circumference, and 24 feet deep, which receives many springs from the mountain Noire. This canal is about 64 leagues in length, is supplied by a number of rivulets, and is furnished with 104 locks, of about eight feet rise each. In some places it passes over bridges of vast height; and in others it cuts through solid rocks for 1000 paces. At one end it joins the river Garonne near Thoulouse, and terminates at the other in the lake Tau, which extends to the port of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CETTE\">Cette</a>. It was planned by Francis Riquet in the 1666, and finished before his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, which happened in the 1680.\n\nIn the Dutch, Austrian, and French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NETHERLANDS\">Netherlands</a>, there is a very great number of canals; that from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUGES\">Bruges</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OSTEND\">Ostend</a> carries vessels of 200 tons.\n\nThe Chinese have also a great number of canals; that which runs from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTON\">Canton</a> to Pekin extends about 825 miles in length, and was executed about 800 years ago.\n\nIt would be an endless task to describe the numberless canals in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, Russia, Germany, &c. We shall therefore confine ourselves to some of the more important in our own country.\n\nAs the promoting of commerce is the principal intention of making canals, it is natural to expect that their frequency in any nation should bear some proportion to the trade carried on in it, providing the situation of the country will admit of them. The present state of England and Scotland confirms this observation. Though the Romans made a canal between the Nyne, a little below Peterborough, and the Witham, three miles below <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a>, which is now almost entirely filled up, yet it is not long since canals were revived in England. They are now however become very numerous, particularly in the counties of York, Lincoln, and Cheshire. Most of the counties betwixt the mouth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRISTOL_CHANNEL\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol0.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a> channel are connected together either by natural or artificial navigations; those upon the Thames and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISIS\">Isis</a> reaching within about 20 miles of those upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVERN\">Severn</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Bridgewater's canal in Cheshire runs 27 miles on a perfect level; but at Barton it is carried by a very high aqueduct bridge over the Irwell, a navigable river; so that it is common for vessels to be passing at the same time both under and above the bridge. It is likewise cut some miles into the hills, where the duke's coal-mines are wrought.\n\nA navigable canal betwixt the Forth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLYDE\">Clyde</a> in Scotland, and which divides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> in two parts, was first thought of by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> II. for transports and small ships of war; the expense of which was to have been 500,000l. a sum far beyond the abilities of his reign. It was again projected in the year 1722, and a survey made; but nothing more done till 1761, when the then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Napier, at his own expense, caused a survey, plan, and estimate on a small scale to be made. In 1764, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TRUSTEES\">trustees</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a>, &c., in Scotland caused another survey, plan, and estimate of a canal five feet deep, which was to cost 79,000l. In 1766, a subscription was obtained by a number of the most respectable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> in Glasgow, for making a canal four feet deep and twenty-four feet in breadth; but when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> was nearly obtained in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, it was given up on account of the smallness of the scale, and a new subscription set on foot for a canal seven feet deep, estimated at 150,000l. This obtained the sanction of parliament; and the work was begun in 1768 by Mr Smeaton the engineer. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> length of the canal from the Forth to the Clyde is 35 miles, beginning at the mouth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRON\">Carron</a>, and ending at Dalmuir Burnfoot on the Clyde, six miles below Glasgow, rising and falling 160 feet by means of 39 locks, 20 on the east side of the summit, and 19 on the west, as the tide does not ebb so low in Clyde as in the Forth by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> feet. Vessels drawing eight feet water, and not exceeding nineteen feet beam and seventy-three feet in length, pass with ease, the canal having afterwards been deepened to upwards of eight feet. The whole enterprise displays the art of man in a high degree. The carrying the canal through moors, quicksand, gravel, and rocks, up precipices and over valleys, was attended with inconceivable difficulties. There are eighteen draw-bridges and fifteen aqueduct bridges of note, besides small ones and tunnels. In the first three miles there are only five locks; but in the fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> there are no less than ten locks, and a very fine aqueduct bridge over the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to the west of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALKIRK\">Falkirk</a>. In the next five miles there are only four locks which carry you to the summit. The canal then runs eighteen miles on a level, and terminates by one branch about a mile from Glasgow. In this course, for a considerable way, the ground is banked about twenty feet high, and the water is sixteen feet deep,\nCanals, and two miles of it is made through a deep moss. At Kirkintilloch, the canal is carried over the water of Logie on an aqueduct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of ninety feet broad. This arch was thrown over in three stretches, having only a centre of thirty feet, which was shifted on small rollers from one stretch to another; a thing new, and never attempted before with an arch of this size; yet the joinings are as fairly equal as any other part, and admired as a very fine piece of masonry. On each side there is a very considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANKING\">banking</a> over the valley. This work was carried on till it came within five miles of its junction with the Clyde; when the subscription and a subsequent loan being exhausted, the work was floated in 1775. The city of Glasgow, however by means of a collateral branch, opened a communication with the Forth, which has produced a revenue of about \u00a36000l. annually; and, in order to finish the remaining five miles, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> in 1784 gave \u00a350,000 out of the forfeited estates, the dividends arising from this sum to be applied to making and repairing roads in the Highlands of Scotland. The work was accordingly resumed; and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a>, under a high penalty, was to be entirely completed in November 1789. The aqueduct bridge over the Kelvin, which is supposed the greatest of the kind in the world, consists of four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>, and carries the canal over a valley 65 feet high, and 420 in length, exhibiting a very singular effort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> ingenuity and labour. To supply the canal with water was of itself a very great work. There is one reservoir of 50 acres 24 feet deep, and another of 70 acres 22 feet deep, into which many rivers and springs terminate, which it is thought will afford a sufficient supply of water at all times. This whole undertaking when finished cost about \u00a3200,000l. It is the greatest of the kind in Britain, and of great national utility; though it is to be regretted that it had not been executed on a still larger scale, the locks being too short for transporting large rafts.\n\nThis canal was completed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1790. On the 28th of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, a track barge belonging to the company of proprietors sailed from the basin, near the city of Glasgow to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOWLING\">Bowling</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>, where the canal joins the river Clyde. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> of management, accompanied by the magistrates of Glasgow, were the first voyagers on the new canal. On the arrival of the vessel at Bowling bay, after descending from the last lock into the Clyde, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> of the junction of the Forth and Clyde was performed by the chairman of the committee, who, with the assistance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> engineer, discharged into the river Clyde, a hogshead of water taken up from the river Forth, as a symbol of joining the western and eastern seas together.\n\nAbout the year 1801, a canal was finished between Loch Gilp to Loch Crinan in Argyllshire. The distance is about nine miles. This canal, which is called the Crinan canal, is intended to accommodate the trade of the Western Islands and fisheries. The vessels employed in this trade will, by means of this canal, avoid the circuitous and dangerous navigation round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULL\">Mull</a> of Cantire.\n\nAnother canal was begun last year (1803), which is intended to open a communication between the Western sea, and the Murray frith, by the lochs or arms of the sea, which stretch inland on the west side, and by Loch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEVIS\">Nevis</a> on the east.","sp":118,"ep":128},{"h":"CANAL","t":"in Anatomy, a duct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> passage through which any of the juices flow.","sp":128,"ep":128},{"h":"CANANOR","t":"a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Malabar, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> can raise a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>.

The inhabitants are Gentoos, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Pagans; and there is a pagod or temple, called Ramnath, which is visited every year by a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of pilgrims.

They are so good observers of their laws, that a robbery or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> is scarce ever heard of among them. The Canarans have forts built of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> along the coast, which are garrisoned with 200 or 300 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against the robberies of their neighbours.

It is said they were first inhabited by the Phoenicians, or Carthaginians, but on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> certain foundation; nor could the inhabitants themselves tell from whence they were derived; on the contrary, they did not know there was any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> in the world. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, manners, and customs, had no resemblance to those of their neighbours. However, they were like the people on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Barbary in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>. They had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>.

See Fringilla. These birds are much admired for their singing, and take their name from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> from whence they originally came, viz., the Canary-islands; but of late years there is a sort of birds brought from Germany, and especially from Tirol, and therefore called German birds, which are much better than the others; though both are supposed to have originally come from the same place. The cocks never grow fat, and by some country people cannot be distinguished from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> green-birds; though the Canary-birds are much lusher, have a longer tail, and differ much in the heaving of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of the throat when they sing. These birds being so much esteemed for their song, are sometimes sold at a high price, according to the goodness and excellency of their notes; so that it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> always be advisable to hear one sing before he is bought. In order to know whether he is in good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, take him out of the store-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAGE\">cage</a>, and put him in a clean cage by himself; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he stand up boldly, without crouching or shrinking in his feathers, look with a brisk eye, and is not subject to clap his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> under his wing, it is a sign that he is in good health; but the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> is to observe his dunging: if he bolts his tail like a nightingale after he has dunged, it is a sign he is not in good health, or at least that he will soon be sick; but if his dung be very thin like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, or of a flimsy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> without any blackness in it, it is a sign of approaching <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. When in perfect health, his dung lies round and hard, with a fine white on the outside, dark within, and dries quickly; though a feed-bird seldom dungs so hard, unless he is very young.\n\nCanary-birds are subject to many diseases, particularly impotheumes which affect the head, cause them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> suddenly from the perch, and die in a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, if not speedily cured. The most approved medicine is an ointment made of fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPON\">capon</a>'s grease melted together. With this the top of the bird's head is to be anointed for two or three days, and it will dissolve the impotheume; but if the medicine has been too long delayed, then, after three or four times anointing, see whether the place of his head be soft; and if so, open it gently, and let out the matter, which will be like the yolk of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>; when this is done, anoint the place, and the bird will be cured. At the same time he must have figs with his other food, and in his water a slice or two of liquorice, with white sugar-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDY\">candy</a>.\n\nCanary-birds are distinguished by different names at different times and ages: such as are about three years old are called runts; those above two are named criffs; those of the first year under the care of the old ones, are termed branchers; those that are new-flown, and cannot feed themselves, pulbers; and those brought up by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, nestlings.\n\nThe Canary-birds may be bred with us; and, if treated with proper care, they will become as vigorous and healthful as in the country from whence they have their name. The cages in which these birds are kept are to be made either of walnut-tree or oak, with bars of wire; because these, being woods of strength, do not require to be used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> pieces. The common shape of cages, which is cylindric, is very improper for these birds; for this allows little room to walk, and without that the birds usually become melancholy. The most proper of all shapes is the high and long, but narrow.\n\nIf these birds eat too much, they grow over-fat, lose their shape, and their singing is spoiled; or at least they become so idle, that they will scarce ever sing. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> their victuals are to be given them in a much smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, and they will by this means be recovered by degrees to all their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, and will sing as at first.\n\nAt the time that they are about to build their nests, there must be put into their cages some hay, dried thoroughly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>: with this must be mixed some moss dried in the same manner, and some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>; and great care is to be taken of breeding the young, in the article of food. As soon as the young birds are eight days old, or somewhat more, and are able to eat and pick up food of themselves, they are to be taken out of the cage in which they were hatched, and each put separately into another cage, and hung up in a room where it may never have an opportunity of hearing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of any other bird. After they have been kept thus about eight days, they are to be excited\nCanary, cited to sing by a bird-pipe; but this is not to be\nblowed too much, or in too shrill a manner, lest they\nsing themselves to death.\n\nFor the first fifteen days the cages are to be covered\nwith a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> cloth, and for the fifteen days following\nwith a green one. Five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LESSONS\">lessons</a> in a day from the pipe\nare sufficient for these young creatures; and they must\nnot be disturbed with several sounds at the same time,\nlest they confound and puzzle them: two lessons should\nbe given them early in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, one about the\nmiddle of the day, and two or more at night.\n\nThe genius and temper of the several birds of this\nkind are very different. The males are almost always\nmelancholy, and will not sing unless they are excited\nto it by hearing others continually singing about them.\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> bird of this kind will often kill the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a>\nput to him for breeding; and when there are several\nfemales together with the males, they will often do\nthe same to one another from jealousy. It is therefore\nnot easy to manage the article of their breeding well\nin this particular, unless in this manner: let two female\nbirds be put into one cage, and when they have lived\ntogether some time, they will have contracted a sort\nof <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> for one another, which will not easily be dissolved.\nPut a male bird into the cage with these two, and\neverything will go well; their friendship will keep\nthem from quarrelling about his favours, and from dan-\nger of his mischievous disposition; for if he attacks\none of them, in order to kill her, the other will immedi-\nately take her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>; and after a few of these battles,\nthe male will find that they are together an over-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> for him at fighting, and will then distribute his\nfavours to them, and there will not fail of being a\nyoung breed or two, which are to be taken away from\ntheir parents, and educated as before directed. Some\nmales watch the time of the female's laying, and de-\nvour the eggs as fast as she deposits them; and others\ntake the young ones in their beak as soon as hatched,\nand crush them to death against the sides of the cage,\nor some other way destroy them. When a male has\nbeen known once to have been guilty of this, he is to\nbe shut up in a small cage, in the middle of the large\none in which the female is breeding her young, and\nthus he will often comfort her with singing all day\nlong, while she sits upon the eggs or takes care of the\nyoung ones; and when the time of taking away, to\nput them into separate cages, is come, the male is to\nbe let out, and he will always after this live in friend-\nship with the female.\n\nIf the male become sick during the time of the fe-\nmale's sitting or bringing up her young, he must be\nremoved immediately, and only brought to the side of\nher cage at certain times, that she may see him, till he\nis perfectly cured; and then he is to be shut up again\nin his cage in the middle.\n\nCanary-birds are various in their notes; some having\na sweet song, others a lowish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, others a long song,\nwhich is best, as having the greatest variety of notes;\nbut they sing chiefly either the titlark or nightingale\nnotes.

The inhabitants, living under the protection of a moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, and being encouraged by their masters, engaged in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>. The Venetian commandants readily afforded to those travellers who visited the island, that assistance which is necessary to enable them to extend and improve useful knowledge. Below, the naturalist, is lavish in praise of their good offices, and describes, in an interesting manner, the flourishing state of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the island which he visited.\n\nThe seat of government was established at Candia. The magistrates and officers, who composed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, resided there. The provost-general was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a>. He possessed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> authority; and his power extended over the whole principality. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in the possession of the Venetians for five centuries and a half. Cornaro held the chief command at the time when it was threatened with a storm, on the side of Constantinople. The Turks, for the space of a year, had been employed in preparing a vast armament. They deceived the Venetian, by assuring him that it was intended against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a>. In the year 1645, in the midst of a solemn peace, they appeared unexpectedly before Crete with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> of 400 sail, having on board 60,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> forces, under the command of four pachas. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Ibrahim, under whom this expedition was undertaken, had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> to offer in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTIFICATION\">justification</a> of his enterprise. He made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of all that perfidy which characterizes the people of the east, to impose on the Venetian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>. He loaded their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> with presents, directed his fleet to bear for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> Matapan, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they had been going beyond the Archipelago; and caused the governors of Tina and Cerigna to be solemnly assured, that the republic had nothing to fear for her possessions. At the very instant when he was making those assurances, his naval armament entered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> of Candia; and, passing between that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> and St Theodore, anchored at the mouth of Platania.\n\nThe Venetians, not expecting this sudden attack, had made no preparations to repel it. The Turks landed without opposition. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of St Theodore is but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> and an half from Candia. It is only three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of a league in compass. The Venetians had erected two forts there; one of which, standing on the summit of the highest eminence, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of that little isle, was called Turluru; the other, on a lower situation, was named St Theodore. It was an important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> to the Muslims to make themselves masters of that rock, which might annoy their ships. They immediately attacked it with ardour. The first of those fortresses, being destitute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> and cannon, was taken without striking a blow. The garrison of the other consisted of no more than 60 men. They made a gallant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, and stood out till the last extremity; and when the Turks at last prevailed, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> was diminished to ten, whom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>-pacha cruelly caused to be beheaded.\n\nBeing now masters of that important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a>, as well as of Lazzaret, an elevated rock, standing about half a league from Candia, the Turks invested the city by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> and land. General Cornaro was struck, as with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>-clap, when he learned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of the enemy. In the whole island there were no more than a body of 3500 infantry, and a small number of cavalry. The besieged city was defended only by 1000 regular troops, and a few citizens, who were able to bear arms. He made haste to give the republic notice of his distress; and posted himself off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, that he might the more readily succour the besieged city. He threw a body of 250 men into the town, before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of the enemy were completed. He afterwards made several attempts to strengthen the besieged with other reinforcements; but in vain. The Turks had advanced in bodies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the town, had carried a half-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTERY\">battery</a>, which covered the gate of Retino; and were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTERING\">battering</a> the walls night and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> with their numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>. The besieged defended themselves with redoubled valour, and the smallest advantage which the besiegers gained cost them dear. General Cornaro made an attempt to arm the Greeks, particularly the Spachits, who boasted loudly of their valour. He formed a battalion of these. But the era of their valour was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> past.

The wicks are made of spun cotton, which the tallow-chandlers buy in skeins, and which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> up into bottoms or clues; whence they are cut out, with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> contrived for purpose, into pieces of the length of the candle required; then put on the sticks or broaches, or else placed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a>, as the candles are intended to be either dipped or moulded.\n\nWax-candles are made of a cotton or flaxen wick, slightly twisted, and covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> wax. Of these, there are several kinds: some of a conical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, used to illuminate churches, and in processions, funeral ceremonies, &c. (see Taper); others of a cylindrical form, used on ordinary occasions. The first are either made with a ladle or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>.\n\n1. To make wax-candles with the ladle. The wicks being prepared, a dozen of them are tied by the neck, at equal distances, round an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> circle, suspended over a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> basin of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> tinned, and full of melted wax: a large ladle full of this wax is poured gently on the tops of the wicks one after another, and this operation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till the candle arrive at its defined bigness; with this precaution, that the three first ladles be poured on at the top of the wick, the fourth at the height of \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), the fifth at \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), and the sixth at \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), in order to give the candle its pyramidal form. Then the candles are taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, kept warm, and rolled and smoothed upon a walnut-tree <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, with a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> instrument of box, smooth at the bottom.\n\n2. As to the manner of making wax-candles by the hand, they begin to soften the wax, by working it several times in hot water, contained in a narrow but deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALDRON\">caldron</a>. A piece of the wax is then taken out, and disposed by little and little around the wick, which is hung on a hook in the wall, by the extremity opposite to the neck; so that they begin with the big end, diminishing still as they descend towards the neck. In other respects the method is nearly the same as in the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. However, it must be observed, that, in the former case, water is always used to moisten the several instruments, to prevent the wax from flickering; and in the latter, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> of olives, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-LARD\">lard</a>, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, &c. The cylindrical wax-candles are either made as the former, with a ladle, or drawn. Wax-candles drawn, are so called, because actually drawn in the manner of wire, by means of two large rollers of wood, turned by a handle, which, turning backwards and forwards several times, pulls the wick through melted wax contained in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> basin, and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> through the holes of an instrument like that used for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> wire fastened at one side of the basin.\n\nIf any chandlers mix with their wares anything deceitfully, &c. the candles shall be forfeited, by stat. 23 Eliz.; and a tax or duty is granted on candles, by 8 and 9 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 6, made for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>, of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENNY\">penny</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>, besides the duty upon tallow, by 8 Anne, cap. 9.

B. The time that one candle lasted was taken from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> of several trials in each size.\n\nIt is observable, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">optics</a>, that the flame of two candles joined, gives a much stronger light than both of them separate. The observation was suggested by Dr Franklin. Probably the union of the two flames produces a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, whereby the vapour is attenuated, and the particles of which light consists are more copiously emitted.\n\nMr Nicholson has made some interesting observations on the light afforded by lamps and candles, which we shall lay before our readers in his own words. \"We are acquainted with no means, (says Dr Franklin), unless we may except <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a>, of producing light but by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a>, and this is most probably of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. The rude method of illumination consists in successively burning certain masses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> state. Common fires answer this purpose in the apartments of houses, and in some lighthouses: small pieces of resinous wood, and the bituminous coal called kannel-coal, are in some countries applied to the same use; but the most general and useful method is that in which fat oil, of an animal or vegetable kind, is burned by means of a wick. These instruments of illumination are either lamps or candles. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>, the oil must be one of those which retains its fluidity in the ordinary temperature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. The candle is formed of an oil, or other material, which is not fusible but at a temperature considerably elevated.\n\n\"The method of measuring the comparative intensities of light is one of the first requisites in an inquiry concerning the art of illumination. Two methods of considerable accuracy are described in the Trait\u00e9 d'Optique of Bouguer, of which an abridged account is given by Dr Priestley in his Optics. The first of these two methods has been used by others since that time, and probably before, from its very obvious nature, but particularly by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Rumford, who has given a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> and drawings of an instrument called the photometer, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1794. The principle it is grounded upon is, that if two lights shine upon the same surface at equal obliquities, and an opaque body be interposed, the two shadows it will produce must differ in blackness or intensity in the same degree. For the shadow formed by intercepting the greater light will be illuminated by the smaller light only, and reversely the other shadow will be illuminated by the greater light. That is to say, in short, the stronger light will be attended with a deeper shadow. But it is easy, by removing the greater light to a greater distance, to render the illumination it produces at the common surface equal to that afforded by the less. Experiments of this kind may be conveniently made by fastening a sheet of white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> against the wall of a room. The two lights or candles intended to be compared, must then be placed so that the ray of light from each shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> with nearly the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCIDENCE\">incidence</a> upon the middle of the paper. By some experiments made in this way in the year 1785, I was satisfied that the degree of illumination could be thus ascertained to the 80th or 90th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the whole.\n\n\"By experiments of this kind many useful particulars may be shewn. Thus, for example, the light of a candle, which is so exceedingly brilliant when first snuffed, is very speedily diminished to one-half, and is usually not more than one-fifth or one-sixth before the uneasiness of the eye induces us to snuff it. Whence it follows, that if candles could be made so as not to require snuffing, the average quantity of light afforded by the same quantity of combustible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> would be more than doubled. In the same way, likewise, since the cost and duration of candles, and the consumption of oil in lamps, are easily ascertainable, it may be shewn whether more or less of light is obtained at the same expense during a given time, by burning a number of small candles instead of one of greater thickness. From a few experiments already made out of the numerous and useful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> that presents itself, I have reason to think that there is very much waste in this expensive article of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>.\n\n\"In the lamp there are three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> which demand our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, the oil, the wick, and the supply of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. It is required that the oil should be readily inflammable, without containing any fetid substance which may prove offensive, or mucilage, or other matter, to obstruct the channels of the wick. I do not know of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> for meliorating oils for this purpose, excepting that of washing with water containing acid or alkali. Either of these is said to render the mucilage of animal oils more soluble in the water; but acid is preferred, because it is less disposed to combine with the oil itself. The office of the wick appears to be chiefly, if not solely, to convey the oil by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of combustion. As the oil is consumed and flies off, other oil succeeds, and in this way a continued current of oil and maintenance of the flame are effected. But as the wicks of lamps are commonly formed...\"\nof combustible matter, it appears to be of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> what the nature and structure of this material may be. It is certain that the flame afforded by a wick of rush differs very considerably from that afforded by cotton; though perhaps this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> may, in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, depend on the relative dimensions of each. And if we may judge from the different odour in blowing out a candle of each sort, there is some reason to suspect that the decomposition of the oil is not effected precisely in the same manner in each. We have also some obscure accounts of prepared wicks for lamps, which are stated to possess the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of facilitating the combustion of very impure oils, so that they shall burn for many hours without smoke or smell.\n\n\"The access of air is of the last importance in every process of combustion. When a lamp is fitted up with a very slender wick, the flame is small, and of a brilliant white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>: if the wick be larger, the combustion is less perfect, and the flame is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>: a still larger wick not only exhibits a brown flame, but the lower internal part appears dark, and is occupied by a portion of volatilized matter, which does not become ignited until it has ascended towards the point. When the wick is either very large or very long, part of this matter escapes combustion, and thaws itself in the form of coal or smoke. The different intensity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNITION\">ignition</a> of flame, according to the greater or less supply of air, is remarkably seen by placing a lamp with a small wick beneath a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> of glass not perfectly closed below, and more or less covered above. While the current of air through the glass shade is perfectly free, the flame is white; but in proportion as the aperture above is diminished, the flame becomes brown, long, wavering, and smoky; it instantly recovers its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> whiteness when the opening is again enlarged.\n\nThe inconvenience of a thick wick has been long since observed, and attempts made to remove it: in some instances by substituting a number of small wicks instead of a larger; and in others, by making the wick flat instead of cylindrical. The most scientific improvement of this kind, though perhaps less simple than the ordinary purposes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> demand, is the well-known lamp of Argand. In this the wick forms a hollow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> or tube, which slides over another tube of metal, so as to afford an adjustment with regard to its length. When this wick is lighted, the flame itself has the figure of a thin tube, to the inner as well as the outer surface of which the air has access from below. And a cylindrical shade of glass serves to keep the flame steady, and in a certain degree to accelerate the current of air. In this very ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> many experiments may be made with the greatest facility. The inconvenience of a long wick, which supplies more oil than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of flame is capable of burning, and which consequently emits smoke, is seen at once by raising the wick; and on the other hand, the effect of a short wick, which affords a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTIVE\">diminutive</a> flame merely for want of a sufficient supply of combustible matter, is observable by the contrary process.\n\n\"The most obvious inconvenience of lamps in general, arises from the fluidity of the combustible material, which requires a vessel adapted to contain it, and even in the best constructed lamps is more or less liable to be spilled. When the wick of a lamp is once adjusted as to its length, the flame continues nearly in the same state for a very considerable time.\n\n\"It is almost unnecessary to describe a thing so universally known as a candle. This article is formed of a congealed oil, which envelopes a porous wick of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FIBROUS\">fibrous</a> vegetable matter. The cylindrical form and dimensions of the oil are given either by casting it in a mould, or by repeatedly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIPPING\">dipping</a> the wick into the fulled ingredient. Upon comparing a candle with a lamp, two very remarkable particulars are immediately seen. In the first place, the tallow itself, which remains in the refilled state, affords a cup or cavity to hold that portion of melted tallow which is ready to flow into the lighted part of the wick. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> place, the combustion, instead of being confined, as in the lamp, to a certain determinate portion of the fibrous matter, is carried, by a slow succession, through the whole length. Hence arises the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> for frequent snuffing the candle; and hence also the station of the freezing point of the fat oil becomes of great consequence. For it has been shown that the brilliancy of the flame depends very much on the diameter of the wick being as small as possible; and this requisite will be most attainable in candles formed of a material that requires a higher degree of heat to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUSE\">fuse</a> it. The wick of a tallow candle must be made thicker in proportion to the greater fusibility of the material, which would otherwise melt the sides of the cup, and run over in streams. The flame will therefore be yellow, smoky, and obscure, excepting for a short time immediately after snuffing. Tallow melts at the 92d degree of Fahrenheit's thermometer; spermaceti at the 133d degree; the fatty matter formed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a> after long immersion in water melts at 127\u00b0; the pala of the Chineese, at 145\u00b0; bees-wax at 142\u00b0; and bleached wax at 155\u00b0. Two of these materials are well known in the fabrication of candles. Wax in particular does not afford so brilliant a flame as tallow: but, on account of its fusibility, the wick can be made smaller; which not only affords the advantage of a clear perfect flame, but from its flexibility it is disposed to turn on one side, and come in contact with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> air, which completely burns the extremity of the wick to white ashes, and thus performs the office of snuffing. We see, therefore, that the important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of rendering tallow candles equal to those of wax, does not at all depend on the combustibility of the respective materials, but upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> advantage in the cup, which is afforded by the inferior degree of fusibility in the wax; and that, to obtain this valuable object, one of the following effects must be produced: Either the tallow must be burned in a lamp, to avoid the gradual progression of the flame along the wick; or some means must be devised to enable the candle to snuff itself, as the wax candle does; or, lastly, the tallow itself must be rendered less fusible by some chemical process. I have no great reason to boast of success in the endeavour to effect these; but my hope is, that the facts and observations here presented may considerably abridge the labour of others in the same pursuit.\n\n\"The makers of thermometers and other small articles with the blowpipe and lamp, give the preference to tallow instead of oil, because its combustion is more complete,\"\nCandle complete, and does not blacken the glass. In this operation, the heat of the lamp melts the tallow which is occasionally brought into its vicinity by the workman. But for the usual purposes of illumination, it cannot be supposed that a person can attend to supply the combustible matter. Considerable difficulties arise in the project for affording this gradual supply as it may be wanted. A cylindrical piece of tallow was inserted into a metallic tube, the upper aperture of which was partly closed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a>, and the central part occupied by a metallic piece nearly resembling that part of the common lamp which carries the wick. In this apparatus the piece last described was intended to answer the same purpose, and was provided with a short wick. The cylinder of tallow was supported beneath in such a manner that the metallic tube and other part of this lamp were left to rest with their whole weight upon the tallow at the ring or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the upper aperture. In this situation the lamp was lighted. It burned for some time with a very bright clear flame, which, when compared with that of a candle, possessed the advantages of uniform intensity, and was much superior to the ordinary flame of a lamp in its colour, and the perfect absence of smell. After some minutes it began to decay, and very soon afterwards went out. Upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> it was found, that the metallic piece which carried the wick had fused a sufficient quantity of tallow for the supply during the combustion; that part of this tallow had flowed beneath the ring, and to other remote parts of the apparatus, beyond the influence of the flame; in consequence of which, the tube, and the cylinder of tallow were fastened together, and the expected progression of supply prevented. It seems probable, that in every lamp for burning combustible oils, the material ought to be so disposed that it may descend to the flame upon the principle of the fountain reservoir. I shall not here state the obstacles which present themselves in the prospect of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, but shall dismiss the subject by remarking, that a contrivance of this nature would be of the greatest public utility.\n\n\"The wick of a candle, being surrounded by the flame, is nearly in the situation of a body exposed to destructive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a> in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> vessel. After losing its volatile products, the carbonaceous residue retains its figure, until, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of the flame, the external air can have access to its upper extremity. But, in this case, the requisite combustion, which might snuff it, is not effected. For the portion of oil emitted by the long wick is not only too large to be perfectly burned, but also carries off much of the heat of the flame while it assumes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> state. By this diminished combustion and increased efflux of half-decomposed oil, a portion of coal or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOOT\">soot</a> is deposited on the upper part of the wick, which gradually accumulates, and at length assumes the appearance of a fungus. The candle does not then give more than one-tenth of the light emitted in its best state. Hence it is that a candle of tallow cannot spontaneously snuff itself. It was not probable that the addition of a substance containing vital air or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a> would supply that principle at the precise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of time required; but, as experiment is the test of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> of this nature, I soaked a wick of cotton in a solution of nitre, then dried it, and made a candle. When this came to be lighted, nothing remarkable happened for a short time; at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> of which a decrepitation followed at the lower extremity of the flame, which completely divided the wick where the blackened part commences. The whole of the matter in combustion therefore fell off, and the candle was of course instantly extinguished. Whether this would have happened in all proportions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> or contractions of the candle I did not try, because the smell of azote was sufficiently strong and unpleasant to forbid the use of nitre in the pursuit. From various considerations I am disposed to think that the spontaneous snuffing of candles made of tallow, or other fusible materials, will scarcely be effected but by the discovery of some material for the wick which shall be voluminous enough to absorb the tallow, and at the same time sufficiently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> on one side.\n\n\"The most promising speculation respecting this most useful article, seems to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> itself to the cup which contains the melted tallow. The imperfection of this part has already been noticed, namely, that it breaks down by fusion, and suffers its fluid contents to escape. The Chinese have a kind of candle about half an inch in diameter, which, in the harbour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTON\">Canton</a>, is called lobchock; but whether the name be Chinese, or the corruption of some European word, I am ignorant. The wick is of cotton, wrapped round a small stick or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> of the bamboo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANE\">cane</a>. The body of the candle is white tallow; but the external part to the thickness of perhaps one-thirtieth of an inch, consists of a waxy matter coloured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>. This covering gives a considerable degree of solidity to the candle, and prevents its guttering, because less fusible than the tallow itself. I did not observe that the stick in the middle was either advantageous or the contrary; and, as I now write from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a> of this object at so remote a period as 25 years ago, I can only conjecture that it might be of advantage in throwing up a less quantity of oil into the flame than would have been conveyed by a wick of cotton sufficiently stout to have occupied its place unsupported in the axis of the candle.\n\n\"Many years ago I made a candle in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the lobchock. The expedient to which I had recourse consisted in adapting the wick in the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEWTER\">pewter</a> mould; wax was then poured in, and immediately afterwards poured out; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FILM\">film</a> of wax which adhered to the inner surface of the mould soon became cool; and the candle was completed by filling the mould with tallow. When it was drawn out, it was found to be cracked longitudinally on its surface, which I attributed to the contraction of the wax, by cooling, being greater than that of the tallow. At present I think it equally probable that the cracking might have been occasioned by too sudden cooling of the wax before the tallow was poured in; but other avocations prevented the experiments from being varied and repeated. It is probable that the Chinese external coating may not be formed of pure hard bleached wax.\n\n\"But the most decisive remedy for the imperfection of this cheapest, and in other respects best material for candles, would undoubtedly be to diminish its fusibility. Various substances may be combined with tallow, either in the direct or indirect method. In the latter way, by the decomposition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>, a number of experiments were made by Berthollet, of which an account...\"\nCandle count is inserted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> of the academy at Paris for the year 1780, and copied into the 26th volume of the Journal de Physique. None of these point directly to the present object; besides which, it is probable that the soap made use of by that eminent chemist was formed not of tallow, but oil. I am not aware of any regular series of experiments concerning the mutual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of fat oils and other chemical agents, more especially such as may be directed to this important object of diminishing its solubility; for which reason I shall mention a few experiments made with this view.\n\n1. Tallow was melted in a small silver vessel. Solid tallow sinks in the fluid, and dissolves without any remarkable appearance. 2. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">Gum</a> sandarach in tears was not dissolved, but emitted bubbles, swelled up, became brown, emitted fumes, and became crisp or friable. No solution nor improvement of the tallow. 3. Shell-lac swelled up with bubbles, and was more perfectly fused than the gum sandarach in the former experiment. When the tallow was poured off, it was thought to congeal rather more speedily. The lac did not appear to be altered. 4. Benzoin bubbled without much twelling, was fused, and emitted fumes of an agreeable smell, though not resembling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> of benzoin. A flight or partial solution seemed to take place. The benzoin was softer and of a darker colour than before, and the tallow less consistent. 5. Common resin unites very readily with melted tallow, and forms a more fusible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> than the tallow itself. 6. Camphor melts easily in tallow, without altering its appearance. When the tallow is near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a>, camphoric fumes fly off. The compound appeared more fusible than tallow. 7. The acid or flowers of benzoin dissolves in great quantities without any ebullition or commotion. Much smoke arises from the compound, which does not smell like the acid of benzoin. Tallow alone does not fume at a low heat, though it emits a smell something like that of oil-olive. When the proportion of the acid was considerable, small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLES\">needles</a> of crystals appeared as the temperature diminished. The appearances of separation are different according to the quantity of acid. The compound has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> and consistence of firm soap, and is partially transparent. 8. Vitriolated tartar, nitre, white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, cream of tartar, crystallized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BORAX\">borax</a>, and the salt sold in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> under the name of salt of lemons, but which is supposed to be the essential salt of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SORREL\">sorrel</a>, or vegetable alkali supersaturated with acid of sugar, were respectively tried without any obvious mutual action or change of properties in the tallow. 9. Calcined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a> rendered tallow opaque and turbid, but did not seem to dissolve. Its effect resembled that of lime.\n\nIt is proposed to try the oxygenated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACETOUS\">acetous</a> acid, or radical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a>; the acid of ants, of sugar, of borax, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALLS\">galls</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TANNING\">tanning</a> principle, the ferrous and gelatinous animal matter, the fecula of vegetables, vegetable gluten, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a>-lime, and other principles, either by direct or indirect application. The object, in a commercial point of view, is entitled to an extensive and affiduous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>. Chemists in general suppose the hardness or less fusibility of wax to arise from oxygen, and to this object it may perhaps be advantageous to direct a certain portion of the inquiry. The metallic salts and calces are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> from which this principle is most commonly obtained; but the combinations of these with fat oils have hitherto afforded little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> of the improvement here sought. The subject is however so little known, that experiments of the loosest and most conjectural kind are by no means to be despised.\"\n\nLighting a Candle by a Small Spark of Electricity. This method, which is an invention of Dr Ingenhousz, is recorded in the Phil. Trans., vol. lxviii. It is done by a small phial, having eight or ten inches of metallic coating, or even less, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with electricity, which may be done at any time of the night by a person who has an electric machine in his room. \"When I have occasion to light a candle,\" says he, \"I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> a small coated phial, whose knob is bent outwards, so as to hang a little over the body of the phial; then I wrap some loose cotton over the extremity of a long brass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> or a wire, so as to stick moderately fast to its substance. I next roll this extremity of the pin wrapped up with cotton in some fine powder of resin, (which I always keep in readiness upon the table for this purpose, either in a wide-mouthed phial or in a loose paper); this being done, I apply the extremity of the pin or wire to the external coating of the charged phial, and bring as quickly as possible the other extremity wrapped round with cotton to the knob: the powder of resin takes fire, and communicates its flame to the cotton, and both together burn long enough to light a candle. As I do not want more than half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> to light my candle in this way, I find it a readier method than kindling it by a flint and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> or calling a fervant. I have found, that powder of white or yellow resin lights easier than that of brown. The farina lycopodi may be used for the same purpose; but it is not so good as the powder of resin, because it does not take fire quite so readily, requiring a stronger spark not to mix; besides, it is soon burnt away. By dipping the cotton in oil of turpentine, the same effect may be as readily obtained, if you take a jar somewhat greater in size. This oil will inflame so much the readier if you throw a few fine particles of brass upon it. The pin dust is the best for this purpose; but as this oil is scattered about by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a>, and when kindled fills the room with much more smoke than the powder of resin, I prefer the last.\"\n\nCandle Bombs, a name given to small glass bubbles, having a neck about an inch long, with a very slender bore, by means of which a small quantity of water is introduced into them, and the orifice afterwards closed up. This flask being put through the wick of a burning candle, the vicinity of the flame soon rarifies the water into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>, by the elasticity of which the glass is broken with a loud crack.\n\nCandle is also a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of medicine, and is reckoned among the instruments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURGERY\">surgery</a>.

It is intended to excite a grateful smell without any flame, to correct the air, to fortify the brain, and to excite the spirits.\n\nMedicated Candle, the same with Bougie.\n\nCandle.

Mr Percival, who has published an account of this island, mentions the jealousy, both of the Dutch and of the natives, as difficulties which could not have been easily surmounted by travellers while it remained subject to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>*. \"The interior of the island (he says), * Account owing to the jealousy of the Dutch, has been little explored by Europeans; and any traveller who might have obtained the permission of the Dutch to visit it, could not have executed his purpose from the jealousy of the natives. Since the Candians have been driven by their invaders into the mountains of the interior, it has been their policy carefully to prevent any European from seeing those objects which might tempt the avarice of his countrymen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> from observing the approaches by which an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> could penetrate their mountains. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> an European by any accident was carried into their territories, they took every precaution to prevent him from escaping; and the guards stationed everywhere at the approaches, joined to the wide and pathless woods which divide the interior from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, rendered such an attempt almost completely desperate. When an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> was sent from any European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> to the king of Candy, he was watched with all that strictness and jealousy, which the suspicious temper of uncivilized nations dictates. In an embassy which I attended to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of that monarch, I had an opportunity of observing how careful the natives were to prevent strangers from making any observations. Mr Boyd, who about twenty years ago went on a similar embassy, was watched with the same particular circumvention; and has therefore been able to add little to our stock of knowledge concerning the interior.\n\n\"The dominions of the native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> are completely cut off on all sides from those of the Europeans by almost impenetrable woods and mountains. The passes which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> through these to the coasts are extremely steep and difficult, and scarcely known even by the natives themselves. As soon as we advance from ten to twenty miles from the coasts, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> presents itself greatly differing from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> coast, both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, and appearance. After ascending the mountains and passing the woods, we find ourselves in the midst of a country not advanced many stages beyond the...\"\nthe first state of improvement, and which we are also\ninclined to find in the neighbourhood of the highly cul-\ntivated fields which surround Columbo. As we advance\ntowards the centre of the island, the country gradually\nrises, and the woods and mountains which separate the\nseveral parts of the country become more steep and im-\npervious.\n\n\"It is in the midst of these fastnesses that the native\nprince still preserves those remains of territory and\npower which have been left him by successive invaders.\nHis dominions are now much reduced in size; for be-\nsides the whole of the sea coasts which were of any va-\nlue, the Dutch, in their various attacks during the last\ncentury, have contrived to get into their power every\ntract from which they could derive either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a>\nor security. Those provinces which still remain to\nhim are Nourecalva and Hotcourtly towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>\nand north-west; while, Matuly, comprehending the\ndistricts of Bintana, Velas, and Panoa, with a few oth-\ners, occupies those parts more to the eastward. To\nthe south-east lies Ouvah, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, and\ngiving the king one of his titles. The western parts\nare chiefly included in the provinces of Cotemal and\nHotteracorley. These different provinces are subdi-\nvided into corles or districts, and entirely belong to\nthe native prince. It is needless to recount the names\nof those divisions which stretch towards the sea coast,\nand are now chiefly in our possession.\n\n\"In the highest and most central <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the native\nking's dominions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> the corles or counties of Oudanar\nand Tatanour, in which are situated the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a>\ncities. These counties take the pre-eminence of all the\nrest, and are both better cultivated, and more populous\nthan any of the other districts, and are distinguished by\nthe general name of Cond\u00e9 Udda; cond\u00e9 or cond\u00e9 in\nthe native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> signifying a mountain, and udda\nthe greatest or highest.\n\n\"This province of Cond\u00e9 Udda is even more inaccel-\nerable than the others, and forms as it were a separate\nkingdom of itself. On every side it is surrounded by\nlofty mountains covered with wood, and the paths by\nwhich it is entered seem little more than the tracks of\nwild beasts. Guards are stationed all around to pre-\nvent both entrance and escape; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> they might\nseem entirely superfluous, did we not recollect that the\nperseverance of the Dutch overcame all these obstacles,\nand forced a way into the very centre of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a>\nfortification.\"\n\nCandy, a town of Asia, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of a kingdom\nof the same name, in the island of Ceylon. It has been\noften burnt by the Portuguese, when they were masters\nof these coasts. It is situated in E. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">Long</a>. 79\u00b0 12'. N.\nLat. 7\u00b0 35'.\n\nWe have the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of Candy by Mr\nPercival, whom we have already quoted, and who at-\ntended an embassy to the king.\n\n\"In the district of Tatanour lies Candy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a>\nresidence and the capital of the native prince's domi-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NIONS\">nions</a>. It is situated at the distance of 80 miles from\nColumbo, and twice as far from Trincomalee, in the\nmidst of lofty and steep hills covered with thick jun-\ngle. The narrow and difficult passes by which it is\napproached are intersected with thick hedges of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THORN\">thorn</a>;\nand hedges of the same fort are drawn round the hills\nin the vicinity of Candy like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of circumvallation.\nThrough them the only passage is by gates of the same\nthorny materials, so contrived as to be drawn up and\nlet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a>. When the Candians are obliged\nto retreat within these barriers, they cut the ropes, and\nthen it is impossible to force a passage except by burn-\ning down the gates, which from their green slate,\nand the constant annoyance of the enemy sheltered\nbehind them, would prove an enterprise of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> and\ndifficulty. These hedge-rows form the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> fortifica-\ntions of Candy. The Malivangonga also nearly sur-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROUNDS\">rounds</a> the hill, on which it stands: that river is here\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, rocky, and rapid; a very strict <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> is kept\non it, and every one who passes or repasses is closely\nwatched and examined.\n\n\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> itself is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> miserable-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>,\nsurrounded by a mud wall of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> strength whatever.\nIt has been several times burnt by Europeans, and was\nonce deserted by the king, who retired to a more inaccesible part of his dominions. It is upon occasion\nof the embassy of General Macdowal, that any infor-\nmation concerning the present state of Candy has been\nobtained; and even then it could be little more than\nguessed at, as the ambassador and his suite were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a>-\nmitted only by torch-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, and always retired before\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. From what could then be observed,\nthe city consists of a long straggling street built on\nthe declivity of a hill; the houses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> and low, but\nwith their foundations raised in such a manner above\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the street that they appear quite lofty to\npassengers. The reason of this extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> is\nto enable the king to hold his assemblies of the people\nand to have his elephant and buffalo fights in the\nstreet, without interfering with the houses. When the\nking passes along the street, none of the inhab-\nitants are allowed to appear before their houses,\nor the paths on a level with them, as that would\nbe attended with the heinous indecency of plac-\ning a subject higher than the prince descended of the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>.\n\n\"At the upper end of this street, stands the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>,\na poor mansion for the abode of a king. It is sur-\nrounded with high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> walls, and consists of two\nsquares, one within the other. In the inner of these\nare the royal apartments, and it is there that the court\nis held and audiences given. The exterior of the pa-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LACE\">lace</a> and the rest of the city could be but very par-\ntially observed by those who attended General Mac-\ndowal, owing to the pressure of the crowd, and the\ndazzling glare of the torches. By every account in-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a> which I have heard, Candy contains nothing\nworthy of notice, and from the want of either wealth\nor industry among the inhabitants, it is not indeed\nto be expected that anything could be met with in\nthis straggling village to attract the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the\ntraveller.\"\n\nCandy, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">Sugar</a>-Candy, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of sugar made\nby melting and crystallizing it five or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> times over,\nto render it hard or transparent.

It is but about two miles in compass; encircled on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> side with a single wall, extremely thick; and defended by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> and deep ditch, cut through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of rock, which extends all around the wall. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> it still deeper, they might cause the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> to flow round its ramparts; on which they have raised <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> platforms, that their great guns might command a wider <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the adjacent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> has only one gate, the gate of Retimo, protected by a half-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTERY\">battery</a>, which is the only exterior fort. The side which faces the sea is the best fortified. On the left of the harbour are four batteries, rising one above another, and planted with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> cannons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> metal, marked with the arms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>. The first of these batteries stands <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> on the brink of the sea. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> side of the harbour is defended only by a strong wall, extending along a chain of pointed rocks which it is dangerous for ships to approach. At the extremity of this wall, there is an old castle, falling into ruins. Beneath that castle, the Venetians had immense arsenals, vaulted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>. Each of these vaults was of sufficient length, breadth, and height, to serve as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>-shop for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> a ship of the line. The ground is sloping, and the outermost part of these capacious arsenals is on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with the sea; so that it was very easy to launch the ships built there into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. The Turks are suffering that magnificent work to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into ruins.\n\nThe city of Canea is laid out on a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>. The streets are large and straight; and the squares adorned with fountains. There are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> remarkable buildings in it. Most of the houses are flat-roofed, and have only one story. Those contiguous to the harbour are adorned with galleries, from which you enjoy a delightful prospect. From the windows you discover the large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> formed between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> Spada and Cape Melec, and all the ships that are entering in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> passing out. The harbour, at present, receives ships of 200 tons burden; and it might be enlarged so as to admit the largest frigates. Its mouth is exposed to the violence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> winds, which sometimes swell the billows above the ramparts. But, as it is narrow, and the bottom is good, ships that are well moored run no danger. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> when Tournefort visited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRETE\">Crete</a>, Canea did not contain more than five or six thousand inhabitants. But, at present, when the gates of Girapetra, Candia, and Retimo are choked up, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> have retired to Canea; and it is reckoned to contain 16,000 souls.

The Roman consuls \u00c6milius Paulus and Terentius Varro, being authorized by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> to quit the defensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, and stake the fortunes of the republic on the chance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, marched from Canium, and encamped a few miles east, in two unequal divisions, with the Aufidus between them. In this position they meant to wait for an opportunity of engaging to advantage; but Hannibal, whose critical situation in a desolated country, without refuge or allies, could admit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> delay, found means to inflame the vanity of Varro by some trivial advantages in skirmishes between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>. The Roman, elated with this success, determined to bring matters to a speedy conclusion; but, finding the ground on the south side too confined for the operations of so large an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, crossed the river; and Varro, raising his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> wing upon the Aufidus, drew out his forces in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>. Hannibal, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> were at Cann\u00e6, no sooner perceived the enemy in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, than he forded the water below, and marshalled his troops in a line opposite to that of his adversaries.\n\nThe Romans were vastly superior in number to the Carthaginians; but the latter were superior in cavalry. The army of the former, consisting of 87,000 men, was drawn up in the usual manner; the hastati in the first line, the principes in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, and the triarii in the third. The cavalry were posted on the wings. On the right, the Roman knights flanked the legionaries; on the left, the cavalry of the allies covered their own infantry. The two consuls commanded the two wings, \u00c6milius the right, and Terentius the left; and the two proconsuls, Servilius and Attilius, the main body. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, Hannibal, whose army consisted of 40,000 foot and 10,000 horse, placed his Gaulish and Spanish cavalry in his left wing, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> the Roman knights; and the Numidian horse in his right, over against the cavalry of the allies of Rome. As to his infantry, he divided the African battalions into two bodies; one of which he posted near the Gaulish and Spanish horse, the other near the Numidian. Between these two bodies were placed on one side the Gaulish, on the other the Spanish infantry, drawn up in such a manner as to form an obtuse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> projecting a considerable way beyond the two wings. Behind this line he drew up a second which had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a>. Adr\u00fbbal commanded the left wing; Maharbal the right; and Hannibal himself, with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGO\">Mago</a>,\nMago, the main body. He had also taken care to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> himself in such a manner, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> Vulturum, which rises at certain stated times, should blow directly in the faces of the Romans during the fight, and cover them with dust. The onset was begun by the light-armed infantry; the Romans discharging their javelins, and the balistes their stones, with pretty equal success; nevertheless, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a> \u00c6milius was wounded.\n\n\u2014Then the Roman cavalry in the right wing advanced against the Gaulish and Spanish in Hannibal's left. As they were thus in by the river Ausidus on one side, and by their infantry on the other, they did not fight, as usual, by charging and wheeling off, and then returning to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> fighting each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> against his adversary, till one of them was killed or retired. After they had made prodigious efforts on both sides to overbear each other, they all on a sudden dismounted, and fought on foot with great fury. In this attack the Gauls and Spaniards soon prevailed; put the Romans to the rout; and, pursuing them along the river, strewed the ground with their dead bodies, Afdubal giving no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> was scarce over, when the infantry on both sides advanced. The Romans first fell upon the Spaniards and Gauls, who, as already observed, formed a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> projecting beyond the two wings. These gave ground, and, pursuant to Hannibal's directions, sunk into the void space in their rear; by which means they infensibly brought the Romans into the centre of the African infantry, and then the fugitives rallying, attacked them in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a>, while the Africans charged them in both flanks. The Romans being, by this artful retreat drawn into the snare and surrounded, no longer kept their ranks, but formed several platoons in order to face every way. \u00c6milius, who was on the right wing, seeing the danger of the main body, at the head of his legionaries acted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> both of a folder and general, penetrating into the heart of the enemy's battalions, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> great numbers of them in pieces. All the Roman cavalry that were left, attended the brave consul on foot; and, encouraged by his example, fought like men in despair. But, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, Afdubal, at the head of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> of Gaulish and Spanish infantry brought from the centre, attacked \u00c6milius's legionaries with such fury, that they were forced to give ground and fly: the consul being all covered with wounds, was at last killed by some of the enemy who did not know him. In the main body, the Romans, though invested on all sides, continued to fall their lives dear; fighting in platoons, and making a great slaughter of the enemy. But being at length overpowered, and disheartened by the death of the two proconsuls, Servilius and Attilius, who headed them, they dispersed and fled, some to the right, and others to the left, as they could find opportunity; but the Numidian horse cut most of them in pieces: the whole plain was covered with heaps of dead bodies, in such manner that Hannibal himself, thinking the butchery too terrible, ordered his men to put a stop to it.\u2014There is a great disagreement among authors as to the number of Romans killed and taken at the battle of Cann\u00e6. According to Livy, the republic lost 50,000 men, including the auxiliaries. According to Polybius, of 6000 Roman horse, only 70 escaped to Venaufa with Terentius Varro, and 300 of the auxiliary horse. As to the infantry, that writer tells us, that 70,000 of the Roman foot died on the field of battle fighting like brave men; and that 13,000 were made prisoners. According to Dionysius of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALICARNASSUS\">Halicarnassus</a>, of 6000 horse, only 370 escaped the general slaughter, and of 82,000 foot, 3000 only were left. The most moderate computation makes the number of Romans killed to amount to 45,000. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of action is marked out to posterity, by the name of Pezzo di Sangue, \"Field of Blood.\"\n\nThese plains have more than once, since the Punic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, afforded room for men to accomplish their mutual destruction. Melo of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARI\">Bari</a>, after raising the standard of revolt against the Greek emperors, and defeating their generals in several engagements, was at last routed here in 1019, by the Catapan Bolanus. Out of 250 Norman adventurers, the flower of Melo's army, only ten escaped the slaughter of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. In 1201, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of Palermo and his rebellious associates, who had taken advantage of the nonage of Frederick of Swabia, were cut to pieces at Cann\u00e6 by Walter de Brienne, sent by the Pope to defend the young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s dominions.\n\nThe traces of the town of Cann\u00e6 are very faint, consisting of fragments of altars, cornices, gates, walls, vaults, and under-ground granaries. It was destroyed the year before the battle: but being rebuilt, became an episcopal see in the infancy of Christianity. It was again ruined in the fifth century, but seems to have subsisted in a humble state many ages later; for we read of its contending with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARLETTA\">Barletta</a> for the territory, which till then had been enjoyed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> by them; and in 1284, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I. issued an edict for dividing the lands, to prevent all future litigation.

And Mezeray relates, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> Edward, by five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> six pieces of cannon, struck terror into the French army, it being the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> they had seen any of these thundering\nCannoning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a>; though others affirm that cannon were known also in France at the same time; but that the French king, in his hurry to attack the English, and in confidence of victory, left all his cannon behind him as useless encumbrances (See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">Artillery</a>). The Germans carry the invention farther back, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBERTUS_MAGNUS\">Albertus Magnus</a>, a Dominican monk, about the year 1250.

According to him, they were mounted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Kitey in the year of Christ 85.

See Gunnery.\n\nSince a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> ship of war may be considered as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of floating batteries, it is evident that the efforts of her artillery must be greatly superior to those of a fortress on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>; that is to say, in general; because, on some particular occasions, her situation may be extremely dangerous, and her cannonading ineffectual. Her superiority consists in several circumstances, as the power of bringing her different batteries to converge to one point; of shifting the line of her attack so as to do the greatest possible execution against the enemy, or to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> where she <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be the least exposed to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a>; and chiefly because, by employing a much greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of cannon against a fort than it can possibly return, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of her artillery against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> walls soon becomes decisive and irresistible. Besides these advantages in the attack, she is also greatly superior in point of defense: because the cannon shot, passing with rapidity through her sides seldom do any execution out of the line of their flight, or occasion much mischief by their splinters; whereas they very soon shatter and destroy the faces of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAPET\">parapet</a>, and produce incredible havoc among the men by the fragments of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, &c. A ship may also retreat when she finds it too dangerous to remain longer exposed to the enemy's fire, or when her own fire cannot produce the desired effect. Finally, the fluctuating situation of a ship, and of the element on which she rests, renders the effects of bombs very uncertain, and altogether destroys the effect of the ricochet, or rolling and bounding shot, which is so pernicious and destructive in a fortress or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> engagement. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> inconvenience to which a ship is exposed, on the contrary, is, that the low-laid cannon in a fort near the brink of the sea, may strike her repeatedly on or under the surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, so as to sink her before her cannonade can have any considerable efficacy.\n\nCanoe, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, in Negroland, with a town of the same name.

The largest are made of the cotton tree; some of them will carry between 20 and 30 hogheads of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> or molasses. Some are made to carry sail; and for this purpose are steeped in water till they become pliant; after which their sides are extended, and strong beams placed between them, on which a deck is afterwards laid that serves to support their sides. The other sorts very rarely carry sail, unless when going before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>: their sails are made of a sort of short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> gafs or ruffs. They are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> rowed with paddles, which are pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> wood somewhat resembling a corn shovel; and, instead of rowing with it horizontally like an oar, they manage it perpendicularly. The small canoes are very narrow, having only room for one person in breadth, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> or eight lengthwise. The rowers, who are generally American savages, are very expert in managing their paddles uniformly, and in balancing the canoes with their bodies; which would be difficult for a stranger to do, how well accustomed forever to the conducting of European boats, because the canoes are extremely light, and liable to be overturned. The American Indians, when they are under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of landing to avoid a water <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, or of crossing the land from one river to another, carry their canoes on their heads, till they arrive at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where they can launch them again. This is the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of canoes, and method of managing them: but some nations have vessels going under the name of canoes, which differ considerably from the above; as the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENLAND\">Greenland</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUDSON_S_BAY\">Hudson's <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>, Otaheite, &c.\n\nCanon, a person who possesses a prebend, or revenue allotted for the performance of divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a>, or collegiate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>.\n\nCanons are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> great antiquity: Pachier observes, that the name canon was not known before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLEMAGNE\">Charlemagne</a>; at least the first we hear of are in Gregory de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TOURS\">Tours</a>, who mentions a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> of canons instituted by Baldwin XVI. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, in the time of Clotharius I. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> attributes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> of this order to Chrodegangus, bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METZ\">Metz</a>, about the middle of the eighth century.\n\nOriginally canons were only priests, or inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a>, who lived in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>; residing by the cathedral church, to assist the bishop; depending entirely on his will; supported by the revenues of the bishopric; and living in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, as his domestics, or counsellors, &c. They even inherited his moveables, till the year 817, when this was prohibited by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIX\">Aix</a>-la-Chapelle, and a new rule substituted\nCanons situated in the place of that which had been appointed by Chrodegangus, and which was observed for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> in the west till the 12th century. By degrees, these communities of priests, shaking off their dependence, formed separate bodies; whereof the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, however, were still heads. In the tenth century, there were communities or congregations of the same kind, established even in cities where there were no bishops: these were called collegiates, as they used the terms <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a> and college indifferently: the name <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a>, now given to these bodies, being much more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a>. Under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of the French kings, the canonical, or collegiate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, had spread itself all over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; and each cathedral had its chapter, distinct from the rest of the clergy. They had the name canon from the Greek \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd, which signifies three different things; a rule, a pension or fixed revenue to live on, and a catalogue or matricula; all which are applicable to them.\n\nIn time, the canons freed themselves from their rules, the observance relaxed, and, at length, they ceased to live in community: yet they still formed bodies; pretending to other functions besides the celebration of the common office in the church; yet assuming the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of the rest of the clergy: making themselves as a necessary council of the bishop; taking upon them the administration of a fee during a vacancy, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of a bishop to supply it. There are even some chapters exempt from the jurisdiction of the bishop, and owning no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> but their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAN\">dean</a>. After the example of cathedral chapters, collegiate ones also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to form bodies, after they had abandoned living in community.\n\nCanons are of various kinds; as,\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Canons, which are those attached, and, as the Latins call it, incardinati to a church, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> is to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>.\n\nDomiciliary Canons, were young canons, who not being in orders, had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> in any particular chapters.\n\nExpectative Canons, were such as, without having any revenue or prebend, had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> and dignities of canons, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> in the chapter, and a place in the choir; till such time as a prebend should fall.\n\nForeign Canons, were such as did not officiate in the canonries to which they belonged. To these were opposed manorial canons, or canons residentiary.\n\nLay or honorary Canons, are such among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAITY\">laity</a> as have been admitted, out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> and respect, into some chapter of canons.\n\nRegular Canons, are canons that still live in community; and who, like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a>, have, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time, to the practice of their rules, added the solemn profession of vows. They are called regulars, to distinguish them from those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> canons who abandon living in community, and at the same time the observance of the canons made as the rule of the clergy, for the maintenance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>. The canons subsisted in their simplicity till the eleventh, some say the twelfth century, when some of them, separating from the community, took with them the name of canons, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACEPHALOUS\">acephalous</a> priests, because they declined to live in community with the bishop; and those who were left thenceforth acquired the denomination of canons regular, and adopted most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a> of the rule of St Augustine. This order of regular canons of St Augustine was brought into England by Adelwald, confessor to Henry I., who erected a priory at Nottel in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>; and obtained for them the church of Carlisle as an episcopal see, with the privilege of choosing their own bishop. They were singularly protected and encouraged by Henry I., who gave them the priory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUNSTABLE\">Dunstable</a> in 1107; and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> Maud, who, in the following year, gave them the priory of the Holy Trinity in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. It appears, that under the reign of Edward I., they had fifty-three priories.\n\nTertiary Canons, those who had only the third part of the revenues of the canonicate.\n\nCanon, in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> or rule, either of doctrine or discipline, enacted especially by a council, and confirmed by the authority of the sovereign.\n\nCanons are properly decisions of matters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>; or regulations of the policy and discipline of a church, made by councils, either general, national, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a>. Such are the canons of the council of Nice, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENT\">Trent</a>, &c.\n\nThere have been various collections of the canons of the eastern councils; but four principal ones, each ampler than the preceding. The first, according to Usher, A.D. 380, containing only those of the first ecumenical council, and the first provincial ones: they were but 164 in number. To these, Dionysius Exiguus, in the year 520, added the 50 canons of the apostles, and those of the other general councils. The Greek canons in this second collection end with those of the council of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHALCEDON\">Chalcedon</a>; to which are subjoined those of the council of Sardica, and the African councils. The fourth and last collection comes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> as low as the second council of Nice; and it is on this that Ballamon and Zonaras have commented.\n\nApostolical Canons, are those which have been usually ascribed to St Clement. Bellarmine, Baronius, &c. will have them to be genuine canons of the apostles: Cotelerius observes, that they cannot be ascribed to the apostles or Clement, because they are not received with other books of Scripture, are not quoted by the writers of the first ages, and contain many things not agreeable to the apostolical times: Hincmar, De Marca, Beveridge, &c. take them to be framed by the bishops who were the apostles disciples in the second or third century; S. Balsagre is of opinion, that they were collected by an anonymous writer in the fifth century; but Daille, &c. maintain them to have been forged by some heretic in the sixth century; and S. Balnage conjectures, that some of them are ancient, and others not older than the seventh century. The Greek church allows only 85 of them, and the Latins only 50; though there are 84 in the edition given of them in the Corpus Juris Canonici.\n\nCanon is also used for the authorized catalogue of the sacred writings. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a>.\n\nThe ancient canon, or catalogue of the books of the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, was made by the Jews, and is ordinarily attributed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EZRA\">Ezra</a>; who is said to have distributed them into the law, the prophets, and the hagiographa, to which our Saviour refers, Luke, chap. xxiv. ver. 44. The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> is also mentioned by Josephus, cont. Appion.\nThis is the canon allowed to have been followed by the primitive church, till the council of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a>; and, according to St Jerome, this consisted of no more than 22 books; answering to the number of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a>; though at present they are divided into 24 divisions, containing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENESIS\">Genesis</a>, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEUTERONOMY\">Deuteronomy</a>, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EZEKIEL\">Ezekiel</a>, the twelve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> prophets, the Psalms, the Proverbs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOB\">Job</a>, Canticles, Ruth, Lamentations, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTES\">Ecclesiastes</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESTHER\">Esther</a>, Daniel, Ezra, comprehending the book of Nehemiah and the Chronicles. However, this order is not universally observed either among Jews or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>; nor were all the books above enumerated admitted into the canon in Ezra's time. It is most likely, says Dr Prideaux, that the two books of Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALACHI\">Malachi</a>, were added in the time of Simon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">Just</a>, when the canon was completed. But that council enlarged the canon very considerably, taking into it the books which we call apocryphal: which the council of Trent has further enforced, enjoining all these to be received as books of Holy Scripture, upon pain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANATHEMA\">anathema</a>, and being attainted of hereby. The Romanists, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of this canon, say, that it is the same with that of the council of Hippo, held in 393; and with that of the third council of Carthage, in 397, at which were present 46 bishops, and, among the rest, St Augustine; who declared that they received it from their fathers.\n\nTheir canon of the New Testament perfectly agrees with ours. It consists of books that are well known; some of which have been universally acknowledged; such are the four Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, thirteen Epistles of St Paul, one Epistle of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>, and one Epistle of St John; and others, concerning which doubts were entertained, but which were afterwards received as genuine; such are the epistle to the Hebrews, that of James, the second of Peter, the second and third of John, that of Jude, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">Revelation</a>. These books were written at different times; and they are authenticated, not by the decrees of councils, or infallible authority, but by such kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> as is thought sufficient in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of any other ancient writings. They were very extensively diffused; they were read in every Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>; they were valued and preserved with care by the first Christians; they were cited by Christian writers of the second, third, and fourth century, as by Irenaeus, Clement the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALEXANDRIAN\">Alexandrian</a>, Tertullian, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGEN\">Origen</a>, Eusebius, &c., and their genuineness is proved by the testimony of those who were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> with the apostles themselves, and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>. The four Gospels, and most of the other books of the New Testament, were collected either by one of the apostles, or some of their disciples and successors, before the end of the first century. The catalogue of canonical books furnished by the more ancient Christian writers, as Origen about the year 215, Eusebius and Athanasius in 315, Epiphanius in 370, Jerome in 382, Aelfin in 394, and many others, agrees with that which is now received among Christians. For the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> the several books of the New Testament, see the titles of the books themselves; as the Gospel of St Matthew, Mark, &c.\n\nSome of the fathers distinguish the inspired writings into three classes; proto-canonical, deutero-canonical, and apocryphal.\n\nPafchal Canon, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> of the moveable feasts, showing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of Easter, and the other feasts depending on it, for a cycle of 19 years.\n\nThe pafchal canon is supposed to be the calculation of Eusebius of Caesarea, and to have been done by order of the council of Nice.\n\nCanon, in monastic orders, a book wherein the religious of every convent have a fair transcript of the rules of their order, frequently read among them as their local statutes. This is also called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REGULA\">regula</a>, as containing the rule and institution of their order.\n\nThe canon differs from the missale, martyrologium, and necrologium.\n\nCanon, again, is used for the catalogue of saints acknowledged and canonized in the Roman church.\n\nCanon is also used, by way of excellence, in the Romish church, for the secret words of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a> to the Pater; in the middle of which the priest consecrates the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOST\">host</a>. The common opinion is, that the canon of the mass commences with Te igitur, &c. The people are to be on their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a>, hearing the canon; and are to rehearse it to themselves, so as not to be heard.\n\nCanon, in the ancient music, is a rule or method of determining the intervals of notes.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>, rejecting the Aristoxenian way of measuring the intervals in music, by the magnitude of a tone (which was supposed to be formed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between a diapente and a diatessaron), thought that musical intervals should be distinguished, according to the ratios or proportions which the sounds terminating those intervals bear to one another, when considered according to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of acuteness or gravity; which, before Aristoxenus, was the old Pythagorean way. He therefore made the diapason consist in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> ratio; the diapente, in a sesquialterate; the diatessaron, in a sesquitertian; and the tone itself, in a sesqui <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OCTAVE\">octave</a>; and all the other intervals, according to the proportion of the sounds that terminate them; wherefore taking the canon (as it is called) for a determinate line of any length, he shows how this canon is to be cut accordingly, so that it may represent the respective intervals: and this method answers exactly to experiment, in the different lengths of musical chords. From this canon, Ptolemy and his followers have been called Canonici; as those of Aristoxenus were called Musici.\n\nCanon, in modern music, is a kind of fugue, which they call a perpetual fugue, because the different parts beginning one after another, repeat incessantly the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>.\n\nFormerly, says Zarlino, they placed, at the head of perpetual fugues, particular directions which showed how this kind of fugues was to be sung; and these directions being properly the rules by which perpetual fugues were composed were called canoni, rules or canons. From this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, others taking the title for the thing signified, by a metonymy, termed this kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> canon. Such canons as are composed with the greatest facility, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> most generally used, begin the fugue either with the octave or the unison; that is to say, that every part repeats in the same tone the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELODY\">melody</a> of the preceding. In order to form\nform a canon of this kind, it is only necessary for the composer to make an air according to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>; to add in score as many parts as he chooses, where the voices in octave or uniform repeat the same melody; then forming a single air from all these parts successively executed, to try whether this succession may form an entire piece which will give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, as well in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> as the melody.\n\nIn order to execute such a canon, he who sings the first part begins alone, and continues till the air is finished; then recommences immediately, without any suspension of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> or interruption of time; as soon as he has ended the first couplet, which ought to serve for the perpetual subject upon which the whole canon has been composed, the second part begins and repeats the same couplet, whilst the first who had begun pursues the second; others in succession begin, and proceed the same way, as soon as he who precedes has reached the end of the first couplet. Thus, by incessantly recommencing, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> can never be found, and the canon may be repeated as long as the fingers please.\n\nA perpetual fugue may likewise consist of parts which begin with the intervals of a fourth or fifth; or, in other words, every part may repeat the melody of the first, a fourth or a fifth higher or lower. It is then necessary that the whole canon should be invented di prima intensione, as the Italians say; and that sharps or flats should be added to the notes, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> gradations do not answer exactly, by a fourth or fifth, to the melody of the preceding part, and produce the same intervals with itself. Here the composer cannot pay the least regard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODULATION\">modulation</a>; his only care is, that the melody may be the same, which renders the formation of a canon more difficult; for at every time when any part resumes the fugue, it takes a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEY\">key</a>; it changes the tone almost at every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, and what is still worse, no part is at the same time found in the same tone with another; hence it is that this kind of canons, in other respects far from being easy to be performed, never produces a pleasing effect, however good the harmony may be, and however properly it may be sung.\n\nThere is a third kind of canon, but very scarce, as well because it is extremely difficult, as because it is for the most part incapable of giving pleasure, and can boast no other merit but the pains which have been thrown away in its composition. This may be called a double canon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a>, as well by the inversions which are practised in it with respect to the melody of the parts, as by those which are found among the parts themselves in fingering. There is such an artifice in this kind of canon, that, whether the parts be sung in their natural order, or whether the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> in which they are set be turned the contrary way, to sing them backward from the end to the beginning, in such a manner that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASS\">bass</a> becomes the upper part, and the rest undergo a similar change, still you have pretty harmony, and still a regular canon. The reader may consult Rouffleau's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DICTIONARY\">Dictionary</a> in this article, where he is referred to Plate D. fig. 11. for two examples of canons of this sort extracted from Bontempi, who likewise gives rules for their composition. But he adds, that the true principle from which this rule is deduced will be found at the word Sylteme, in his account of the system of Tartini, to which we must likewise once more refer the reader; as a quotation of such length must have protracted our article to an enormous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>.\n\nTo form a canon in which the harmony may be a little varied, it is necessary that the parts should not follow each other in a succession too rapid, and that the one should only begin a considerable time after the other. When they follow one another so immediately as at the distance of a semibreve or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINIM\">minim</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> is not sufficient to admit a great number of chords, and the canon must of necessity exhibit a disagreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONOTONY\">monotony</a>; but it is a method of composing, without much difficulty, a canon in as many parts as the composer chooses. For a canon of four bars only, will consist of eight parts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they follow each other at the distance of half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>; and by each bar which is added, two parts will constantly be gained.\n\nThe emperor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> VI. who was a great musician, and composed extremely well, took much pleasure in composing and fingering canons. Italy is still replete with most beautiful canons composed for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, by the best masters in that country. To what has been said by Rouffleau, we need only subjoin, that the English catch and the Italian canon are much the same; as any intelligent reader may perceive, from comparing the structure and execution of the English catch with the account of canons which has now been given.\n\nCanon, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">Geometry</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALGEBRA\">Algebra</a>, a general rule for the solution of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of a like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> with the present inquiry. Thus every last step of an equation is a canon; and, if turned into words, becomes a rule to solve all questions of the same nature with that proposed.\n\nCanon Law, a collection of ecclesiastical laws, serving as the rule and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of church <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>.\n\nThe power of making laws was exercised by the church before the Roman empire became Christian. The canon law that obtained throughout the west, till the 12th century, was the collection of canons made by Dionysius Exiguus in 520, the capitularies of Charlemagne, and the decrees of the popes from Siricius to Anastasius.\n\nThe canon law, even when papal authority was at its height in England, was of no force when it was found to contradict the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a> of the king, the laws, statutes and customs of the realm, or the doctrine of the established church.\n\nThe ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the see of Rome in England was founded on the canon law; and this created quarrels between kings and several archbishops and prelates who adhered to the papal usurpation.\n\nBesides the foreign canons, there were several laws and constitutions made here for the government of the church; but all these received their force from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> assent; and if, at any time, the ecclesiastical courts did, by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>, endeavour to enforce obedience to such canons, the courts at common law, upon complaints made, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> prohibition. The authority vested in the church of England of making canons, was ascertained by a statute of Henry VIII., commonly called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of the clergy's submission; by which they acknowledged, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVOCATION\">convocation</a> had always been assembled by the king's writ; so that\nthough the power of making canons resided in the clergy met in convocation, their force was derived from the authority of the king's assent to and confirming them.\n\nThe old canons continued in full force till the reign of James I. when the clergy being assembled in convocation, the king gave them leave to treat and consult upon canons; which they did, and presented them to the king, who gave them the royal assent: these were a collection out of the several preceding canons and injunctions. Some of these canons are now obsolete. In the reign of Charles I. several canons were passed by the clergy in convocation.","sp":147,"ep":152},{"h":"CANONESS","t":"in the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, a woman who enjoys a prebend, affixed, by the foundation, to maids, without their being obliged to renounce the world <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> make any vows.","sp":152,"ep":152},{"h":"CANONICA","t":"in philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, an appellation given by Epicurus to his doctrine of logic. It was called canonica, as consisting of a few canons <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> rules for directing the understanding in the pursuit and knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. Epicurus's canonica is represented as a very slight and insufficient logic by several of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, who put a great value on his ethics and physics. Laertius even affirms us, that the Epicureans rejected logic as a superfluous science; and Plutarch complains that Epicurus made an unskillful and powerless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of syllogisms. But these censures seem too severe. Epicurus was not adverse to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of logic, but even gave better rules in this art than those philosophers who aimed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> but that of logics. He only seems to have rejected the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALECTICS\">dialectics</a> of the Stoics, as full of vain subtleties and deceits, and fitted rather for parade and disputation than real use. The stricts of Epicurus's canonica consist in his doctrine of the criteria of truth. All questions in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> are either concerning words or things: concerning things, we seek their truth; concerning words, their signification: things are either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> or moral; and the former are either perceived by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> or by the understanding. Hence, according to Epicurus arise three criterions of truth, viz., sense, anticipation or prevision, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>. The great canon or principle of Epicurus's logic is, that the senses are never deceived; and therefore, that every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> or perception of an appearance is true.","sp":152,"ep":152},{"h":"CANONICAL","t":"something that belongs to, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> partakes of, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of a rule or canon.\n\nCANONICAL Hours, are certain stated times of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, confirmed, more especially by the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, to the offices of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>.

The canonical life was a kind of medium between the monastic and clerical lives. Originally the orders of monks and clerks were entirely distinct; but pious persons, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, instituted colleges of priests and canons, where clerks brought up for the ministry, as well as others already engaged therein, might live under a fixed rule, which, though somewhat more easy than the monastic, was yet more restrained than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a>. This was called the canonical life, and those who embraced it canons. Authors are divided about the founder of the canonical life. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> have it to be founded by the apostles; others ascribe it to Pope Urban I. about the year 1250, who is said to have ordered bishops to provide such of their clergy as were willing to live in community, with necessaries out of the revenues of their churches. The generality attributes it to St Augustine; who, having gathered a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of clerks to devote themselves to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, instituted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONASTERY\">monastery</a> within the episcopal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, where he lived in community with them. Onuphrius Paninius brings the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> somewhat lower; according to him, Pope Gelasius I. about the year 495, placed the first regular canons of St Augustine in the Lateran church.\n\nCANONICAL Letters, in the ancient church, were a sort of testimonials of the orthodox <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, which the bishops and clergy sent each other to keep up the Catholic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a>, and distinguish orthodox <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARIANS\">Arians</a> and other heretics.

The inhabitants were famous for their warlike character. In conjunction with the Asturians, they carried on desperate wars with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>; but were subdued by them about 25 years before Christ. Being impatient, however, of a foreign yoke, they in a few years revolted. Most of their youth had been already taken prisoners by the Romans, and sold for slaves to the neighbouring nations: but having found means to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> their chains, they cut the throats of their masters; and returning into their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, attacked the Roman garrisons with incredible fury. Agrippa marched against them with great expedition; but on his arrival, met with so vigorous a resistance, that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> began to despair of ever being able to reduce them. As the Cantabrians had waged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with the Romans for upwards of 200 years, they were well acquainted with their manner of fighting, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> way inferior to them in courage, and were now become desperate; well knowing, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they were conquered, after having so often attempted to recover their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, they must expect the most severe usage, and cruel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>. Animated with this reflection, they fell upon the Romans with a fury hardly to be expressed, routed them in several engagements, and defended themselves when attacked by the enemy with such intrepidity, that Agrippa afterwards owned, that he had never, either by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, been engaged in a more dangerous enterprise. That brave commander was obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> entreaties, menaces, and to brand some of his legionaries with ignominy, before he could bring them to enter the lists with such a formidable enemy. But having at last, with much ado, prevailed upon them to try the chance of an engagement in the open field, he so animated them by his example, that, after a most obstinate dispute, he gained a complete victory, which indeed cost him dear, but put an end to that destructive war. All the Cantabrians fit to bear arms were cut in pieces; their castles and strongholds taken and razed; and their women, children, and old men (none else being left alive), were obliged to abandon the mountainous places, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>.\n\nDr Wallis seems to make the Cantabrian the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>; which, according to him, like the Gaulish, gave way to a kind of broken Latin called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANCE\">romance</a> or roman\u00eda; which by degrees was refined into the Castilian or present Spanish. But we can hardly suppose, that so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> a country, inhabited by such a variety of people, spoke all the same language. The ancient Cantabrian, in effect, is still found to subsist in the more barren and mountainous parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Biscay, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTURIAS\">Asturias</a>, and Navarre, as far as Bayonne, much as the British does in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>; but the people only talk it: for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, they use either the Spanish or French, as they happen to live under the one or the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>.

Scarce had he finished his academic course, when he printed a Concordance of the Psalms in the Russian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, and was elected member of the academy. The affairs of state in which he was soon after engaged, did not make him neglect his literary pursuits. In order to make himself useful to his fellow citizens, he composed his satires, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> certain prejudices which had got footing among them.

N. Lat. 51. 16. It had the names of Duravernum and Darvernium given it by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, and Durobernia by Bede, which are thought to be derived from Dur-wbem, signifying a rapid stream, such as the Stour, on which it stands, is. The Britons call it Caer Kent, i.e. the city of Kent; and its present English name is of the same import, derived from the Saxon. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">Modern</a> writers in Latin call it Cantuaria. Its great antiquity appears not only from Antoninus's Itinerary, but from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> way which has been discovered here, and the causeways leading to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a> and Lymne, besides the coins and other curiosities found about it. The archiepiscopal and metropolitan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> seems to have been settled here very early; and to prevent its being removed, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANATHEMA\">anathema</a> was decreed against any who should attempt it. After that, the city flourished greatly; though it suffered in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> with other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> during the Danish invasions, and at other times by the casualties of fire. The city was given entirely to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> by William Rufus, and was held in the utmost veneration in the Popish times, especially after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> of Becket in the reign of Henry II. to whose shrine so great was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a>, and to rich were the offerings, that Erasmus, who was an eye witness of its wealth, says the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> and chapel in which he was interred glittered with jewels; and at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a>, the plate and jewels filled two great chests, each of which required eight strong men to carry out. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> was granted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ETHELBERT\">Ethelbert</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Kent, upon his conversion, to Austin the monk, together with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, and the royalty of the city and its territories. This Austin founded a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONASTERY\">monastery</a> for monks, called from him Augustine. After the cathedral had been several times destroyed by fire and rebuilt, the present was begun about the year 1174, and augmented and embellished by the succeeding archbishops, till it was completed in the reign of Henry V. It is a noble Gothic pile, and before the Reformation had 37 altars. A great many kings, princes, cardinals, and archbishops, are buried in it. At the dissolution, Henry VIII. seized all the revenues both of the church and monastery, except what he allotted for the maintenance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAN\">dean</a>, 12 prebendaries, and fix preachers, whom he established in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of the monks. During the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> rebellion, it suffered much; the usurper Cromwell having made a stable of it for his dragoons. After the Restoration, it was repaired, and made what it now appears.\n\nBesides the cathedral and other churches, as well as a monastery, the city had anciently a castle on the south side, and strong walls, with towers, a ditch, and rampart; it had also a mint and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a>. As to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, it seems to have been entirely subject to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a>, both in spirituals and temporals; at least from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that William Rufus gave it solely to Bishop Anfelm, till the Reformation. It is now a county of itself: and the corporation consists of a mayor, recorder, 12 aldermen, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a>, 24 common councilmen, a mace-bearer, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>-bearer, and four sergeants-at-mace. Every Monday a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> is held at Guildhall Canterbury for civil and criminal causes; and every other Tuesday for the government of the city. Here were formerly 2000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 3000 French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a> employed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> manufacture; but this branch is now greatly decayed in the place, since Spitalfields became so flourishing. Besides the cathedral, it contains 15 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> churches, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>, a free school, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of correction, a gaol for criminals, and sumptuous conduit for supplying the inhabitants with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. It consists of four streets, disposed in the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>, and divided into six wards, which are about three miles in circumference. It is surrounded on all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> with hop grounds much to its advantage, and is famed for its excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a> of Canterbury contains 257 parishes, besides chapels, in Kent, and about 100 more in other dioceses. These are called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PECULIARS\">Peculiars</a>; it being an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> privilege of this see, that wheresoever the archbishops had either manors or advowsons, the place was exempted from the jurisdiction of the ordinary of the diocese where it was situated, and was deemed in the diocese of Canterbury. This see is valued in the king's books at \u00a3216l. 17s. 9\u00bdd., but is reckoned to produce a clear revenue of \u00a38000. a year. The clergy's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITHES\">tithes</a> come to \u00a3611. 18s. 2\u00bdd. This see had many great privileges in the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPERY\">Popery</a>, some of which it still retains. The archbishop is accounted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMATE\">primate</a> and metropolitan of all England, and is the first peer in the realm; having the precedence of all dukes not of the blood <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a>, and of all the great officers of state. In common speech he is styled His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">Grace</a>, and he writes himself Divina Providentia; whereas other bishops style themselves Divina Permissione. At coronations, he places the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> on the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>; and, wherever the court may be, the king and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> are the proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> parishioners of the archbishop of Canterbury. The bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> is accounted his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> dean, the bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINCHESTER\">Winchester</a> his subdean, the bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a>, and the bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROCHESTER\">Rochester</a> his chaplain.

The book of Canticles is usually supposed to be an epistle written by Solomon, on occasion of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>.

On this principle the Canticles is held to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> allegory, wherein under the terms of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> wedding, a divine and spiritual marriage is expressed.

The Jews themselves, apprehending the book liable to be understood in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> and carnal manner, prohibited the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> of it before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 30, and the same usage anciently obtained in the Christian church. Among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, Theodore Mopstactus rejected the book of Canticles as not divine. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">Divers</a> rabbins have also questioned its being written by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a>. It is alleged, that the name of God is not once found in it. Mr Whiston has a discourse expressly to prove that the Canticles is not a sacred book of the Old Testament. He alleges it indeed to have been written by King Solomon the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>; but asserts that it was composed at the time when that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, blinded by his concubines, was sunk in lust and idolatry. This he chiefly infers from the general character of vanity and dissoluteness which reigns through the Canticles: in which there is not, according to Whiston, one thought that leads the mind towards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, but all is worldly and carnal, to say <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> worse. For the mystic style, he affects it to be without foundation; and that the book is not cited as canonical by any writer before the destruction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>. Mr Whiston <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> have it to have been taken into the canon between the years 77 and 128, when allegories came into vogue, and the rabbins began to corrupt the text of Scripture. Grotius, Nierembergus, the Dutch divines who criticized F. Simon, Menetrier, Baphage, and some others, seem also to take the Canticles for a profane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, on a footing with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> pieces of Catullus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Ovid. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> is refuted by Michaelis, Majus, Witsius, Nat. Alexander, Outrein, Francius, and others. Mr Whiston's arguments have been particularly considered by Itchenor, and also by Dr Gill. R. Akiba finds the book of Canticles more divine than the rest: the whole world, according to this rabbin, is not worth that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> when the Canticles was given to Israel; for, whereas all the hagiographers are holy, the Canticles is the holy of holies.","sp":157,"ep":157},{"h":"CANTIMARONS","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> CATIMARONS, a kind of Cantimaroats or rafts, used by the inhabitants of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Coromandel to go a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> in, and to trade along the coast.

In the midst of all these revolutions it still retained its ancient name (which was so agreeable to its shape and situation), and gave the same name to all the successive tribes by which it was inhabited. Those who politicised it at the time of the first Roman invasion were evidently of Belgic origin, and had come over so lately, that they differed in nothing from their countrymen on the continent. \"The inhabitants of Kent (says Caesar) are the most civilized of all the Britons, and differ but very little in their manners from the Gauls.\" This great resemblance between the people of Kent and their neighbours on the continent, might be partly owing to the situation of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, which being nearest to the continent, was most frequented by strangers from thence. It was this situation also which exposed them to the first assaults of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>. For Caesar, in both his expeditions into this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, landed in Kent; and therefore we may conclude,\nthat the Cantii had a great share in the vigorous opposition that was made to his landing, and in the several battles and skirmishes which were fought against him after his landing; particularly, they made a very bold, but unsuccessful attempt, upon his naval <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>. The Cantii did not make the same vigorous resistance to the Romans on their next invasion in the reign of Claudius. For Aulus Plautius, the Roman general in that expedition, traversed their country without seeing an enemy; and as they now submitted to the power of Rome without a struggle, so they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in a state of quiet submission to it to the very last. The situation of Cantium occasioned its being much frequented by the Romans, who generally took their way through it in their marches to and from the continent. Few places in Britain are more frequently mentioned by the Roman writers than Rutupium and Portus Rutupensis, most probably Richborough and Stonar. Rutupium was the name in those times that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a> is in ours; the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of embarking for, and landing from, the continent. Before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> departure of the Romans out of Britain, Portus Dubris, now Dover, had become a considerable place, and a well-frequented harbour, where the third iter of Antoninus ends, and from whence they often embarked for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a>. Portus Lemanus, supposed to be Lime near West <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-HYTHE\">Hythe</a>, was also a noted seaport in these times, and the termination of the fourth iter of Antoninus. Du-robri\u00e6 and Durovernum, now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROCHESTER\">Rochester</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTERBURY\">Canterbury</a>, were both Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> and stations, and are often mentioned in the Itinerary and other books. Besides these, there were several other Roman stations, towns, and ports in Cantium, which need not be particularly enumerated here. Cantium, in the most perfect state of the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> which was called Flavia Caesariensis.","sp":157,"ep":158},{"h":"CANTO","t":"denotes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of a poem, answering to what is otherwise called a book. The word is Italian, where it properly signifies song. Tasso, Ariosto, and several other Italians, have divided their longer or heroic poems into cantos. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of them, Scarron has also divided his Gigantomachia, and Boileau his Lutrin, into chants or songs. The like usage has been adopted by some English writers, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a>, who divides his Hudibras, and Dr Garth's Dispensary, into cantos. A late translator of part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>'s \u00c6neid has even subdivided a book of Virgil into several cantos.\n\nCanto, in the Italian music, signifies a song; hence canto semplice is where all the notes or figures are equal, and called also canto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FERMO\">fermo</a>; canto figurato, that where the figures are unequal, and express different motions.","sp":158,"ep":158},{"h":"CANTO ALSO","t":"o also signifies the treble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a song; hence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTO\">canto</a> concertante, the treble of the little chorus; canto ripieno, the treble of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> chorus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> that which sings only now and then in particular places.

The country is diversified with hills and plains, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> in general so fertile that it produces two crops annually. Besides many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, and those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in other parts of the Indies, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Canton produces some peculiar to itself. Abundance of valuable aromatic woods are also to be met with in this province, as well as eagle wood, ebony, &c., and in the mineral kingdom the province furnishes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, tin, quicksilver, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">Silk</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> are also cultivated here, and pearls are fished up on the coasts; so that everything which can contribute to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> or convenience of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> is to be met with in Canton. \"One begins (says F. Piemare) to have an idea of China, on entering the river Canton. Both sides of it present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> fields of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a> which resemble green meadows, and extend beyond the reach of sight. They are intersected by an infinite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>, in such a manner that the barks which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> and repass in them seem at a distance, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> which carries them is concealed, to glide along the groves. Farther inland the country appears covered with trees, and cultivated along the valleys; and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> is interspersed with villages, rural seats, and such a variety of delightful prospects, that one is never tired of viewing them, and regrets to be obliged to pass them so quickly.\n\nAll the coasts of this province abound with fish, and furnish vast numbers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CRABS\">crabs</a>, oysters, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TORTOISES\">tortoises</a> of an immense size. The inhabitants keep a prodigious number of tame ducks, which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HATCH\">hatch</a> in ovens or dunghills, though it does not appear that they borrowed this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> from the Egyptians. The docility of these creatures exceeds what we should be apt at first to imagine. The inhabitants load a number of small barks with them, and carry them in flocks to feed on the sea shore, where they find shrimps and other animals proper for their nourishment. But though the ducks from the different barks are thus unavoidably mixed together in the daytime, they are easily collected by only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASON\">bason</a>, on which they immediately collect themselves into different flocks, and each returns to his proper bark.\n\nIn this province the Chinese have also a method of preserving not only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> of the ducks in such a manner that it loses nothing of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> flavour, but their eggs also. The latter operation is performed by covering the eggs with a coat of clay mixed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>. When mixed in this manner, it seems that the salt has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of penetrating through the pores of the shell, and thus impregnating the substance in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>, which it could not do by simple solution in water.\n\nCanton, though it suffered much in the Chinese wars, is at present one of the most flourishing provinces of the empire; and being at a great distance from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, its government is one of the most important. A great number of fortresses, many of which are cities, provided with numerous garrisons, have been built along the coasts for the suppression of pirates and robbers; for which purpose also a certain number of troops are kept properly posted in different parts of the province. It is divided into ten districts, which contain as many cities of the first class, and 84 of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> and third. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> in general is warm but healthy,\nhealthy, and the people are very industrious. They possess in an eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>; so that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they are only shown any European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, they can execute others like it with surprising exactness. The most remarkable cities in the province besides Canton the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> are, 1. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAO_TCHEOU_FOU\">Chao-tcheou-fou</a>, chiefly noted for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONASTERY\">monastery</a> of bouzes in its neighbourhood, to which the adjacent country belongs, and the origin of which is traced back for 800 or 900 years. It has under its jurisdiction six cities of the third class; near one of these grows a reed of which several instruments are made, which cannot be distinguished from real ebony. The air of Chao-tcheou-fou, however, is unhealthy; and great numbers of the inhabitants are carried off annually by contagious distempers, which prevail from the middle of October to the beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>.\n\n2. Kao-tcheou-fou, situated in a delightful and plentiful country. In the neighbourhood is found a singular kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> much resembling marble, on which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> representations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, landscapes, and trees. These stones are cut into slabs, and made into tables, &c. Crabs are also caught on the coasts here, which very much resemble those of Europe; but, says M. Grosier, they have this singularity, that when taken out of the water, they become petrified without losing any thing of their natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. 3. Kiun-tcheou-fou, the capital of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Hai-nan. See Hai-nan.\n\nCanton, a large, populous, and wealthy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of China, capital of the province of that name, stands on the banks of the river Taa, or great river, which, near the city, is wide and spacious. The wall of the city is pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, and about five or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> miles in circumference, though not more than one third of the ground is occupied by buildings, the other parts being appropriated to pleasure grounds or to fish ponds. The country is extremely pleasant, and towards the east hilly, so as to command a beautiful prospect of the city and suburbs, the compass of which, together, is about ten miles.\n\nThe buildings of Canton are in general low, consisting of one story and a ground <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>, which is covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> tiles in order to keep it cool; but the houses of the most respectable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> and mandarins are comparatively lofty and well built. In different parts of the city and suburbs are joss houses or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>, in which are placed the images worshipped by the Chinese; before whom are placed, at particular seasons, a vast variety of sweetmeats, oranges, great plenty of food ready dressed, and also incense, which is kept perpetually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>.\n\nThe streets of Canton are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and narrow, paved with flat stones, adorned at intervals with triumphal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>, which have a pleasing effect, and much crowded with people. On both sides are shops as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, appropriated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of different commodities; and a kind of awning is extended from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> to house, which prevents the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>'s rays from incommoding either inhabitants or passengers. At the end of every street is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a>, which, with the gates of the city, are shut in the evening. In China street, which is pretty long and considerably wider than the rest, reside merchants; whose trade, so far as respects china, lacquered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WARE\">ware</a>, fans, &c., is wholly confined to Europeans. Most of them speak the foreign languages tolerably well, or at least sufficiently intelligible to transact business. Besides these merchants, there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of twelve or thirteen, called the Cohong; who have an exclusive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> by appointment from authority to purchase the cargoes from the different ships, and also to supply them with teas, raw silks, &c., in return. The establishment of the Cohong, though injurious to private trade, is admirably well adapted for the security of the different companies with which they traffic; because each individual becomes a guarantee for the whole; so that if one fail, the others consider themselves as responsible.\n\nIn Canton there are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a>; all burdens are carried by porters across their shoulders on bamsos; as are also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> people in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEDAN\">sedan</a> chairs, and the ladies always. The streets of Canton may be traversed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> till evening without seeing a woman, those excepted who are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a>, and even these but very seldom.\n\nOn the wharf of the river, which is commodious and pleasant, stand the factories of the different European nations, viz. the Dutch, French, Swedes, Danes, English, &c. In those reside the supercargoes belonging to their respective companies, who are appointed to dispose of the cargoes brought to market; to supply the ships with others from Europe in return; and, during their absence, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> with the merchants for such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> as may be judged necessary for the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>. Between the residents of the factories the most perfect cordiality subsists; in each a common and splendid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> is kept at the company's expense, and visits are reciprocally exchanged; so that nothing is wanting to make residence at Canton agreeable to an European, but the pleasure naturally resulting from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of women.\n\nThe side of the river next the city is covered with boats, which form a kind of town or streets, in which live the poorer sort of the Chinese, or rather the descendants of the Tartars. Some of the men come on shore in the morning to their respective employments, and in those sampans, or boats which are not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>, the women and also the men carry passengers from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> to place in the same manner as is done by wherries on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a>. On this river live many thousand souls who never were permitted to come on shore; whose only habitation is their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>; in which they eat, drink, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, carry on many occupations, keep ducks, &c. and occasionally a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOG\">hog</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> of Canton are principally carried on in the suburbs; though it has been frequently supposed that they were confined to the city; and this, by some writers, has been given as a reason why Europeans are not permitted to enter within the gates. But this is a mistake; and perhaps the true reason for this very singular restraint is, that the houses in which they keep their women are chiefly within the city.\n\nAt Wampoa, a large commodious place for anchorage, and which is about 12 or 14 miles from Canton, the European vessels <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> and unload their cargoes, which are transmitted by lighters to the factories; and by the same conveyance receive their respective freights. Between this place and the city are three hoppo, or customhouses, at which the boats passing and repassing are obliged to stop, and undergo with their passengers an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, in order to prevent smuggling.\nThe lighters <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned, and also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>'s pinnace, are, however, excepted; the former having proper officers on board for the purpose, and the latter being narrowly watched and examined at the landing.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> at Canton is, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, extremely hot; and in the months of December, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a>, and February, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>: the country is nevertheless pleasant and healthful, abounding with all the necessaries and delicacies of life, which may be procured on terms much cheaper than in Europe. The number of inhabitants has been estimated at one million; but later calculations have made the number considerably less. N. Lat. 23\u00b0 30' E. Long. 113\u00b0 20'.\n\nCanton, John, an ingenious natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, was born at Stroud, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLOUCESTERSHIRE\">Gloucestershire</a>, in 1718; and was placed, when young, under the care of a Mr Davis, of the same place, a very able mathematician, with whom, before he had attained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> years, he had gone through both vulgar and decimal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a>. He then proceeded to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, and particularly to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALGEBRA\">algebra</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, wherein he had made a considerable progress, when his father took him from school, and put him to learn his own business, which was that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> cloth weaver. This circumstance was not able to damp his zeal for the acquisition of knowledge. All his leisure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> was devoted to the assiduous cultivation of astronomical science; and, by the help of the Caroline tables annexed to \"Wing's Astronomy,\" he computed eclipses of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> and other phenomena. His acquaintance with that science he applied likewise to the constructing of several kinds of dials. But the studies of our young philosopher being frequently pursued to very late hours, his father, fearing that they would injure his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, forbade him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> in his chamber any longer than for the purpose of going to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, and would himself often see that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INJUNCTION\">injunction</a> was obeyed. The son's thirst of knowledge was, however, so great, that it made him attempt to evade the prohibition, and to find means of secreting his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> had retired to rest; when he rose to prosecute undisturbed his favourite pursuits. It was during this prohibition, and at these hours, that he computed, and cut upon stone, with no better an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> than a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of a large upright sun <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAL\">dial</a>, on which, besides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, was shown the rising of the sun, his place in the ecliptic, and some other particulars. When this was finished, and made known to his father, he permitted it to be placed before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of his house, where it excited the admiration of several gentlemen in the neighbourhood, and introduced young Mr Canton to their acquaintance, which was followed by the offer of the use of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LIBRARIES\">libraries</a>. In the library of one of these gentlemen, he found \"Martin's Philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">Grammar</a>,\" which was the first book that gave him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">natural <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>. In the possession of another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, a few miles from Stroud, he first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of globes; an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> that afforded him uncommon pleasure, from the great ease with which he could solve those problems he had hitherto been accustomed to compute. The dial was beautified a few years ago at the expense of the gentlemen at Stroud, several of whom had been his schoolfellows, and who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> still to regard it as a very distinguished performance.\n\nAmong other persons with whom he became acquainted in early life, was the late reverend and ingenious Dr Henry Miles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TOOTING\">Tooting</a>, a learned and respectable member of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> society, and of approved eminence in natural knowledge. This gentleman perceiving that Mr Canton possessed abilities too promising to be confined within the narrow limits of a country town, prevailed on his father to permit him to come to London. Accordingly he arrived at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 4, 1737, and resided with Dr Miles at Tooting till the 6th of May following; when he articled himself for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of five years, as a clerk to Mr Samuel Watkins, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the academy in Spital-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>. In this situation, his ingenuity, diligence, and good conduct, were so well displayed, that on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> of his clerkship in May 1742, he was taken into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTNERSHIP\">partnership</a> with Mr Watkins for three years; which gentleman afterwards succeeded in Spital-square, and there continued during his whole life. In 1744, he married Penelope, the eldest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Mr Thomas Colbrooke, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIECE\">niece</a> to James Colbrooke, Esq., banker in London.\n\nTowards the end of 1745, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a>, which seems early to have engaged Mr Canton's notice, received a very capital improvement by the discovery of the famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a> Phial. This event turned the thoughts of most of the philosophers of Europe to that branch of natural philosophy; and our author, who was one of the first to repeat and to pursue the experiment, found his fidelity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> rewarded by many capital discoveries. Towards the end of 1749, he was concerned with his friend, the late Mr Benjamin Robins, in making experiments in order to determine what height rockets may be made to ascend, and at what distance their light may be seen. In 1750 was read at the Royal Society Mr Canton's \"Method of making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> magnets, without the use of, and yet far superior to, any natural ones.\" This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> procured him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of being elected a member of the society, and the present of their gold medal. The same year he was complimented with the degree of M.A. by the university of Aberdeen; and, in 1751, was chosen one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of the Royal Society.\n\nIn 1752, our philosopher was so fortunate as to be the first person in England, who, by attracting the electric fire from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> during a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> storm, verified Dr Franklin's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> of the similarity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a> and electricity. Next year, his paper entitled, \"Electrical Experiments, with an attempt to account for their several Phenomena,\" was read at the Royal Society. In the same paper Mr Canton mentioned his having discovered, by a great number of experiments, that some clouds were in a positive, and some in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>, state of electricity. Dr Franklin, much about the same time, made the like discovery in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>. This circumstance, together with our author's constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a>'s hypothesis, induced that excellent philosopher, immediately on his arrival in England, to pay Mr Canton a visit, and gave rise to a friendship which ever after continued without interruption or diminution. In the \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIARY\">Diary</a>, for 1756,\" our author answered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> question that had been proposed in the preceding year. The question\nCanton was, \"How can what we call the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> of stars be best accounted for; what is the substance of this phenomenon; and in what state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> doth it most frequently show itself?\" The solution, though anonymous, was so satisfactory to his friend, Mr Thomas Simpkin, who then conducted that work, that he sent Mr Canton the prize, accompanied with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, in which he said, he was sure that he was not mistaken in the author of it, as no one besides, that he knew of, could have answered the question. Our philosopher's next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> to the public, was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> in the \"Gentleman's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>,\" for September 1759, on the electrical properties of the telemalin, in which the laws of that wonderful stone are laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in a very concise and elegant manner. On December 12th, in the same year, was read at the Royal Society, \"An attempt to account for the regular diurnal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">Horizontal</a> Magnetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLE\">Needle</a>; and also for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> variation at the time of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-AURORA_BOREALIS\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA\">Aurora</a> Borealis.\" A complete year's observations of the diurnal variations of the needle are annexed to the paper. On Nov. 5, 1761, our author communicated to the Royal Society an account of the Transit of Venus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 6, 1761, observed in Spital-square. Mr Canton's next communication to the Society, was a letter addressed to Dr Benjamin Franklin, and read Feb. 4, 1762; containing some remarks on Mr Delaval's electrical experiments. On Dec. 16, in the same year, another curious addition was made by him to philosophical knowledge, in a paper entitled, \"Experiments to prove that water is not incomprehensible.\" These experiments are a complete refutation of the famous Florentine experiments, which so many philosophers have mentioned as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the incomprehensibility of water. On St Andrew's day, 1763, our author was the third time elected one of the council of the Royal Society; and on Nov. 8, in the following year, were read before that learned body, his farther \"Experiments and observations on the comprehensibility of water, and some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>.\" The establishment of this fact, in opposition to the received <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, formed on the hasty decision of the Florentine Academy, was thought to be deserving of the society's gold medal. It was accordingly moved for in the council of 1764; and after several invidious delays, which terminated much to the honour of Mr Canton, it was presented to him Nov. 30, 1765.\n\nThe next communication of our ingenious author to the Royal Society, which we shall take notice of in this place, was on Dec. 22, 1763, being \"An easy method of making a Phosphorus that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> imbibe and emit light like the Bolognian stone; with experiments and observations.\" When he first showed to Dr Franklin the instantaneous light acquired by some of this phosphorus from the near discharge of an electrified bottle, the doctor immediately exclaimed, \"And God said, Let there be light, and there was light.\" The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAN\">dean</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of St Paul's having, in a letter to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a>, dated March 5, 1769, requested the opinion of the Royal Society relative to the best and most effectual method of fixing electrical conductors to preserve that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> from damage by lightning, Mr Canton was one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> appointed to take the letter into consideration, and to report their opinion upon it. The gentlemen joined with him in this Cantoning business were, Dr Watson, Dr Franklin, Mr Delaval, and Mr Willson. Their report was made on the 8th of June following; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> recommended by them has been carried into execution. The last paper of our author's, which was read before the Royal Society, was on Dec. 21, 1769; and contained \"Experiments to prove that the Luminousness of the Sea arises from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a> of its animal substances.\" In the account now given of his communications to the public, we have chiefly confined ourselves to such as were the most important, and which threw new and distinguished light on various objects in the philosophical world. Besides these he wrote a number of papers both in earlier and in later life, which appeared in several different publications, and particularly in the Gentleman's Magazine.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> and sedentary life of Mr Canton, arising from an unremitting attention to the duties of his profession, and to the prosecution of his philosophical inquiries and experiments, probably contributed to shorten his days. The disorder into which he fell, and which carried him off, was a dropfly. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> happened on March 22, 1772, in the 54th year of his age.","sp":158,"ep":161},{"h":"CANTONING","t":"in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> art, is the allotting distinct and separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> to each regiment; the town where they are quartered being divided into as many cantons as there are regiments.","sp":161,"ep":161},{"h":"CANTRED","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Cantreth, signifies a hundred villages.

Having thus settled his power in England, he made a voyage to his other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>, in order to resist the attacks of the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>; and he carried along with him a great body of the English under the command of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Godwin. This nobleman had here an opportunity of performing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> by which he both reconciled the king's mind to the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, and, gaining to himself the friendship of his sovereign, laid the foundation of that immense fortune which he acquired to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>. He was stationed next the Swedish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>; and observing a favourable opportunity which he was obliged suddenly to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a>, he attacked the enemy in the night, drove them suddenly from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENCHES\">trenches</a>, threw them into disorder, pursued his advantage, and obtained a decisive victory over them. Next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, Canute, seeing the English camp entirely abandoned, imagined that these disaffected troops had deserted to the enemy; and he was agreeably surprised to find that they were at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> engaged in pursuit of the discomfited Swedes. He was so pleased with this success, and the manner of obtaining it, that he bestowed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> upon Godwin, and treated him ever after with the most entire confidence and regard.\n\nIn another voyage which he afterwards made to Denmark, Canute attacked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a>, and expelled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> but unwarlike Olaus from his kingdom, of which he kept possession till the death of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>. He had now by his conquests and valour attained the utmost height of his ambition; and having leisure from wars and intrigues, he felt the unsatisfactory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> enjoyments: and equally weary of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> and torments of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, he began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> his views towards that future existence, which it is so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> for the human mind, whether satiated by prosperity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> disgusted with adversity, to make the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. Unfortunately the spirit which prevailed in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> gave a wrong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>; and, instead of making atonement to those whom he had formerly injured by his acts of violence, he entirely employed himself in those exercises of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, which the monks represented as most meritorious. He built churches; he endowed monasteries; he enriched <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a>; and he bestowed revenues for the support of chantries at Affington and other places, where he appointed prayers to be said for the souls of those who had there fallen in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> against him. He even undertook a pilgrimage to Rome, where he performed a considerable time; and, besides obtaining from the pope some privileges for the English school erected there, he engaged all the princes through whose dominions he was obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>, to desist from those heavy impositions and tolls which they were accustomed to exact from the English pilgrims. By this spirit of devotion, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less than by his equitable and politic administration, he gained in a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the affections of his subjects.\n\nCanute, who was the greatest and most powerful prince of his time, sovereign of Denmark and Norway as well as of England, could not fail to meet with adulation from his courtiers; a tribute which is liberally paid even to the meanest and weakest of princes. Some of his flatterers breaking out one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> in admiration of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>, exclaimed that every thing was possible for him; upon which the monarch, it is said, ordered a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> to be set on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> shore while the tide was making; and as the waters approached, he commanded them to retire, and obey the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of him who was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> of the ocean. He feigned to sit some time in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of their submission; but when the sea still advanced towards him, and began to wash him with its billows, he turned to his courtiers, and remarked to them, That every creature in the universe was feeble and impotent, and that power reposed with one Being alone, in whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> were all the elements of nature, who could say to the ocean, \"Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther,\" and who could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with his nod the most towering piles of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> and\nCanzone and ambition.

But though John I. the victor, feigned a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his estate, his widow, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Gonfalo Tereyro, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the order of Christ, and general of the Portuguese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, was not reduced beneath her rank. She had three sons who took the name of Camoens. The family of the eldest intermarried with the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>; and even, according to Cafera, with the blood <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a>. But the family of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, whose fortune was slender, had the superior honour to produce the author of the Lusiad.\n\nEarly in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> the misfortunes of the poet began. In his infancy, Simon Vaz de Camoens, his father, commander of a vessel, was shipwrecked at Goa, where, with his life, the greatest part of his fortune was lost. His mother, however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a> de Macedo of Santarene, provided for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> of her son Louis at the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIMBRA\">Coimbra</a>. What he acquired there, his works discover; an intimacy with the classics, equal to that of a Scaliger, but directed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> a Pope.\n\nWhen he left the university, he appeared at court. He was handsome; had speaking eyes, it is said; and the finest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>. Certain it is, however, he was a polished scholar, which, added to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> ardour and gay vivacity of his disposition, rendered him an accomplished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>. Courts are the scenes of intrigue; and intrigue was fashionable at Lisbon. But the particulars of the amours of Camoens rest unknown. This only appears: he had aspired above his rank, for he was banished from the court; and in several of his sonnets he attributes this misfortune to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>.\n\nHe now retired to his mother's friends at Santarene. Here he renewed his studies, and began his poem on the discovery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>. John III. at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> prepared an armament against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>. Camoens, tired of his inactive obscure life, went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CEUTA\">Ceuta</a> in this expedition, and greatly distinguished his valour in several encounters. In a naval engagement with the Moors in the straits of Gibraltar, in the conflict of boarding, he was among the foremost, and lost his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> eye. Yet neither hurry of actual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> nor the dissipation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a> could stifle his genius. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> his *Lusiadas*, and several of his most beautiful sonnets were written in Africa, while, as he expressed it,\n\nOne <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a>, and one the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, employ'd.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of his valour had now reached the court, and he obtained permission to return to Lisbon. But, while he solicited an establishment which he had merited in the ranks of battle, the malignity of evil tongues, as he calls it in one of his letters, was injuriously poured upon him. Though the bloom of his early youth was effaced by several years residence under the scorching heavens of Africa, and though altered by the loss of an eye, his presence gave uneasiness to the gentlemen of some families of the first rank where he had formerly visited. Jealousy is the characteristic of the Spaniards and Portuguese; its resentment knows <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> bounds, and Camoens now found it prudent to banish himself from his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. Accordingly, in 1553, he sailed for India, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> never to return. As the ship left the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAGUS\">Tagus</a>, he exclaimed, in the words of the sepulchral monument of Scipio Africanus,\nCamoeus canus, Ingrata patria, non possehis affu mea! \"Ungrateful country, thou shalt not possess my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>!\" But he knew not what evils in the east would awake the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> of his native fields.\n\nWhen Camoens arrived in India, an expedition was ready to fail to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> the king of Cochin on the king of Pimenta. Without any rest on shore after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> voyage, he joined this armament, and in the conquest of the Alagada <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> displayed his usual bravery.\n\nIn the year following, he attended Manuel de Vasconcelos in an expedition to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RED_SEA\"><a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. Here, says <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIA\">Paria</a>, as Camoens had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> for his sword, he employed his pen. Nor was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> confined to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> or camp. He visited Mount Felix and the adjacent inhospitable regions of Africa, which he so strongly pictures in the Lusiad, and in one of his little pieces where he laments the absence of his mistress.\n\nWhen he returned to Goa, he enjoyed a tranquillity which enabled him to bestow his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> on his epic poem. But this serenity was interrupted, perhaps by his own imprudence. He wrote some satires which gave offence; and by order of the viceroy Francisco Barreto, he was banished to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>.\n\nThe accomplishments and manners of Camoens soon found him friends, though under the disgrace of banishment. He was appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSARY\">commissary</a> of the defunct in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACAO\">Macao</a>, a Portuguese settlement in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTON\">Canton</a>. Here he continued his Lusiad; and here also, after five years residence, he acquired a fortune, though small, yet equal to his wishes. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Constantine de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRAGANZA\">Braganza</a> was now viceroy of India; and Camoens, desirous to return to Goa, resigned his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>. In a ship, freighted by himself, he set sail; but was shipwrecked in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> near the mouth of the river Mehon on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of China. All he had acquired was lost in the waves; his poems, which he held in one hand, while he swammed with the other, were all he found himself possessed of when he stood friendless on the unknown shore. But the natives gave him a most humane reception: this he has immortalized in the prophetic song in the tenth Lusiad; and in the seventh, he tells us, that here he lost the wealth which satisfied his wishes.\n\nAgora da elparanga ja adquirida, etc.\n\nNow blest with all the wealth fond hope could crave,\nSoon I beheld that wealth beneath the wave\nFor ever lost;\nMy life, like Judah's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>-doom'd king of yore,\nBy miracle prolong'd\u2014\n\nOn the banks of the Mehon he wrote his beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAPHRASE\">paraphrase</a> of the psalm, where the Jews, in the finest strain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, are represented as hanging their harps on the willows, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLON\">Babylon</a>, and weeping their exile from their native country. Here Camoens continued some time, till an opportunity offered to carry him to Goa. When he arrived at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, Don Constantine de Braganza, the viceroy, whose characteristic was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a>, admitted him into intimate friendship, and Camoens was happy till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Redondo assumed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. Those who had formerly procured the banishment of the satirist, were silent while Constantine was in power; but now they exerted all their arts against him. Redondo, when he entered on office, pretended to be the friend of Camoens; yet, with all that unfeeling indifference with which he made his most horrible witticism on the Zamorin, he suffered the innocent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> to be thrown into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> prison. After all the delay of bringing witnesses, Camoens, in a public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, fully refuted every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a> of his conduct while commissary at Macao, and his enemies were loaded with ignominy and reproach. But Camoens had some creditors, and these detained him in prison a considerable time, till the gentlemen of Goa began to be ashamed that a man of his singular merit should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> such treatment among them. He was set at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>; and again he assumed the profession of arms, and received the allowance of a gentleman volunteer, a character at this time common in Portuguese India. Soon after, Pedro Barreto, appointed governor of the fort at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOFALA\">Sofala</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> promises, allured the poet to attend him thither. The governor of a distant fort, in a barbarous country, shares in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the fate of an exile. Yet, though the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> of Barreto was, in this unpleasant situation, to retain the conversation of Camoens at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, it was his least care to render the life of his guest agreeable. Chagrined with his treatment, and a considerable time having elapsed in vain dependence upon Barreto, Camoens resolved to return to his native country. A ship, on the homeward voyage, at this time touched at Sofala, and several gentlemen who were on board were desirous that Camoens should accompany them. But this the governor ungallantly endeavoured to prevent, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> him with a debt for board. Anthony de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CABRA\">Cabra</a>, however, and Hector de Sylveira, paid the demand; and Camoens, says Farin, and the honour of Barreto, were told together.\n\nAfter an absence of 16 years, Camoens, in 1569, returned to Lisbon, unhappy even in his arrival, for the pestilence then raged in that city, and prevented his publication for three years. At last, in 1572, he printed his Lusiad, which, in the opening of the first book, in a most elegant turn of compliment, he addressed to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, King Sebastian, then in his 18th year. The king, says the French translator, was so pleased with his merit, that he gave the author a pension of 4000 reals, on condition that he should reside at court. But this salary, says the same writer, was withdrawn by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Henry, who succeeded to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of Portugal, lost by Sebastian at the battle of Alcazar.\n\nThough the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of literature, a species the reverence of that of Camoens, certain it is, that the author of the Lusiad was utterly neglected by Henry, under whose inglorious reign he died in all the misery of poverty. By some, it is said, he died in an alms-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>. It appears, however, that he had not even the certainty of subsistence which these houses provide. He had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a>, who had grown old with him, and who had long experienced his master's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>. This grateful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a>, a native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAVA\">Java</a>, who, according to some writers, saved his master's life in the unhappy shipwreck where he lost his effects, begged in the streets of Lisbon for the only man in Portugal on whom God had bestowed these talents which have a tendency to erect the spirit of a downward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. To the eye of a careful observer, the fate of Camoens throws\nCamomile throws great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on that of his country, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> appear strictly connected with it. The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, the same degenerated spirit, which suffered Camoens to depend on his share of the alms begged in the streets by his old hoary servant, the same spirit which caused this funk the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of Portugal into the most abject vassalage ever experienced by a conquered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>.\n\nWhile the grandees of Portugal were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> to the ruin which impended over them, Camoens beheld it with a pungency of grief which hastened his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXIT\">exit</a>. In one of his letters he has these remarkable words: *Em fim acabarey \u00e0 vida, e verram todos que fui eficaz contra a minha patria, &c.* \"I am ending the course of my life; the world will witness how I have loved my country. I have returned, not only to die in her bosom, but to die with her.\"\n\nIn this unhappy situation, in 1579, in his 62d year, the year after the fatal defeat of Don Sebastian, died Louis de Camoens, the greatest literary genius ever produced by Portugal; in martial courage and spirit of honour, nothing inferior to her greatest heroes. And in a manner suitable to the poverty in which he died, was he buried.\n\n**CAMOMILE.** See Anthemis, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">Botany</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>.\n\n**CAMP,** the ground on which an army pitch their tents. It is marked out by the quartermaster general, who appoints every regiment their ground.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> advantages to be minded in choosing a camp for an army, are, to have it near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, in a country of forage, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> may find wood for dressing their victuals; that it have a free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with garrisons, and with a country from whence it may be supplied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>; and, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> possible, that it be situated on a rising ground, in a dry gravelly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>. Besides, the advantages of the ground ought to be considered, as marshes, woods, rivers, and enclosures; and if the camp be near the enemy, with no river or marsh to cover it, the army ought to be intrenched. An army always encamps fronting the enemy; and generally in two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, running <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> about 500 yards distance; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> and dragoons, on the wings; and the foot, in the centre: sometimes a body of two, three, or four brigades, is encamped behind the two lines, and is called the body of reserve. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>-waggons are generally encamped in the rear of the two lines. A battalion of foot is allowed 80 or 100 paces for its camp; and 30 or 40 for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between one battalion and another. A squadron of horse is allowed 30 for its camp, and 30 for an interval, and more if the ground will allow it.\n\nWhere the grounds are equally dry, those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPS\">camps</a> are always the most healthful that are pitched on the banks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> rivers; because, in the hot season, situations of this kind have a stream of fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> from the water, serving to carry off the moist and putrid exhalations. On the other hand, next to marshes, the worst encampments are on low grounds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> before trees; for then the air is not only moist and hurtful in itself, but by stagnating becomes more susceptible of corruption. However, let the situation of camps be ever so good, they are frequently rendered infectious by the putrid effluvia of rotten straw, and the privies of the army, more especially if the bloody <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a> prevails; in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the best method of preventing a general infection, is to leave the ground with the privies, foul straw, and other filth, of the camp behind. This must be frequently done, if consistent with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> operations: but when these render it improper to change the ground often, the privies should be made deeper than usual, and once a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> a thick layer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> thrown into them till the pits are near full; and then they are to be well covered, and supplied by others. It may also be a proper caution to order the pits to be made either in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> or the rear, as the then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a> winds may best carry off their effluvia from the camp. Moreover, it will be necessary to change the straw frequently; as being not only apt to rot, but to retain the infectious steams of the sick. But if fresh straw cannot be procured, more care must be taken in airing the tents, as well as the old straw.\n\nThe disposition of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> encampment was at first laid out by God himself. Their camp was of a quadrangular form, surrounded with an enclosure of the height of 10 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>-breadth. It made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of 12 miles in compass about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABERNACLE\">tabernacle</a>; and within this was another called the Levites' camp.\n\nThe Greeks had also their camps fortified with gates and ditches. The Lacedemonians made their camp of a round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> upon that as the most perfect and defensible of any form: we are not, however, to imagine, that they thought this form so essential to a camp, as never to be dispensed with when the circumstances of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> required it. Of the rest of the Grecian camps, it may be observed, that the most valiant of the soldiers were placed at the extremities, the rest in the middle. Thus we learn from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACHILLES\">Achilles</a> and Ajax were posted at the ends of the camp before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a>, as bulwarks on each side of the rest of the princes.\n\nThe figure of the Roman camp was a square divided into two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> parts: in the upper part were the general's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAVILION\">pavilion</a>, or praetorium, and the tents of the chief officers; in the lower, those of inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> were placed. On one side of the praetorium stood the questorium, or apartment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a> of the army; and near this the forum, both for a market place and the assembling of councils. On the other side of the praetorium were lodged the legati; and below it the tribunes had their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, opposite to their respective legions. Aside of the tribunes were the praefecti of the foreign troops, over against their respective wings; and behind these were the lodgments of the evocati, then those of the extraordinarii and ablest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-EQUITES\">equites</a>, which concluded the higher part of the camp. Between the two partitions was a spot of ground called principia, for the altars and images of the gods, and probably also for the chief ensigns. The middle of the lower partition was assigned to the Roman horse; next to them were quartered the triarii; then the principes, and close by them the hastati; afterwards the foreign horse, and lastly, the foreign foot. They fortified their camp with a ditch and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAPET\">parapet</a>, which they termed fossa and wallum; in the latter some distinguished two parts, viz. the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGGER\">agger</a> or earthen, and the fossae or wooden stakes driven in to secure it. The camps were sometimes surrounded by walls made of hewn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>; and the tents themselves formed of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>.\n\nIn the front of the Turkish camp are quartered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JANIZARIES\">janizaries</a> and other foot, whose tents encompass their aga; in the rear are the quarters of the spahis and other\nCamp other horsemen. The body of the camp is possessed by the flatly tents or pavilions of the vizier or general, rais effendi or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a>, khajia or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEWARD\">steward</a>, the teftedar baihaw or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> treasurer, and kapilar kahiafeer or master of the ceremonies. In the middle of these tents is a spacious field, wherein is erected a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVAN\">divan</a>, and a hafna or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>. When the ground is marked out for a camp, all wait for the pitching of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENT\">tent</a> lafiae, the place where the courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> are held; it being the disposition of this that is to regulate all the rest.\n\nThe Arabs still live in camps, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Scenites did. The camp of the Affyne Emir, or king of the country about Tadmor, is described by a traveller who viewed it, as spread over a very large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, and possessing so vast a space, that though he had the advantage of a rising ground, he could not see the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of it. His own tent was near the middle; scarce distinguishable from the rest, except that it was bigger, being made, like the others, of a sort of haircloth.\n\nCamp, is also used by the Siamese, and some other nations in the East Indies, as the name of the quarters which they assign to foreigners who come to trade with them. In these camps, every nation forms, as it were, a particular town, where they carry on all their trade, not only keeping all their warehouses and shops there, but also live in these camps with their whole families. The Europeans, however, are so far indulged, that at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIAM\">Siam</a>, and almost everywhere else, they may live either in the cities or suburbs, as they shall judge most convenient.\n\nCamp-fight, or Kamp-fight, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> writers, denotes the trial of a cause by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUEL\">duel</a>, or a legal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> of two champions in the field, for decision of some controversy.\n\nIn the trial by camp fight, the accuser was, with the peril of his own body, to prove the accused guilty; and by offering him his glove, to challenge him to this trial, which the other must either accept of, or acknowledge himself guilty of the crime whereof he was accused.\n\nIf it were a crime deserving death, the camp-fight was for life and death: if the offence deserved only imprisonment, the camp fight was accomplished when one combatant had subdued the other, so as either to make him yield or take him prisoner. The accused had liberty to choose another to fight in his stead, but the accuser was obliged to perform it in his own person, and with equality of weapons. No women were permitted to be spectators, nor men under the age of thirteen. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> and the people who looked on, were engaged silently in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a>, that the victory might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to him who had right. None might cry, shriek, or give the least sign; which in some places was executed with so much strictness, that the executioner stood ready with an axe to cut off the right hand or foot of the party that should offend therein.\n\nHe that, being wounded, yielded himself, was at the other's mercy either to be killed or suffered to live. But if life were granted him, he was declared infamous by the judge, and disabled from ever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> arms, or riding on horseback.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMPAGNA\">CAMPAGNA</a>.

From the account of M. de la Condamine, we learn that this substance oozes out, under the form of a vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, from incisions made in the tree; and that it is gathered chiefly in time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, because, though it may be collected at all times, it flows then most abundantly. The means employed to infuse and indurate it, M. de la Borde says, are kept a profound secret. M. Bomare, and others, affirm, that it thickens and hardens gradually by being exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; and as soon as it acquires a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> confidence it manifests a very extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of flexibility and elasticity. Accordingly the Indians make boots of it which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> cannot penetrate, and which, when smoked, have the appearance of real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>. Bottles are also made of it, to the necks of which are fastened hollow reeds, so that the liquor contained in them may be squirted through the reeds or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> by pressure. One of these filled with water is always presented to each of the guests at their entertainments, who never fail to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of it before eating. This whimsical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> led the Portuguese in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> to call the tree that produces the resin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAU\">pau</a> da xirringa; and hence the name of seringa is given both to the tree and to its resinous production. Flambeaux, an inch and a half in diameter, and two feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, are likewise made of this resin, which give a beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, have no bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, and burn twelve hours. A kind of cloth is also prepared from it, which the inhabitants of Quito apply to the same purpose as our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> cloth and fail cloth. It is formed, in fine, by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a>, into a variety of figures for use and ornament; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> is said to be thus:\u2014The juice, which is obtained by incision, is spread over pieces of clay formed into the desired shape; and as fast as one layer is dry, another is added, till the vessel be of the proper thickness: the whole is then held over a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> of vegetables on fire, whereby it hardens into the texture and appearance of leather; and before the finishing, while yet soft, is capable of having any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> made on the outside, which remains ever after. When the whole is done, the inside mould is picked out.\n\nSince this resin has been known in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, its chemical qualities and other interesting properties have been very diligently investigated. In particular, it has been endeavoured to discover some method of dissolving it in such a manner that it would assume different figures, with equal ease as when in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> state fluid. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> of the Academy of Sciences for 1768, we have an account of several attempts for this purpose, and how it may be effected.\u2014The state of vegetable milk in which the caoutchouc resin is found when it comes from the tree, led M. Macquer to imagine that it was composed of an oil and a watery matter. From its wanting aromatic flavour, from its little volatility, and from its being incapable of solution in spirit of wine, he concluded that the oil which entered its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> was not an essential, but a fatty one. Hence he thought it probable that it passed from a fluid to a solid form by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> of the watery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>, and that the oily solvents would reduce it to a soft state. The first trials he made for dissolving it were with linseed oil, essence of turpentine, and several others. But all he could obtain by means of these menstrua was a viscid substance incapable of being hardened, and totally void of elasticity. The rectified essential oil of turpentine was employed seemingly with greater success. To separate from this menstruum the caoutchouc which it had dissolved, M. Macquer added spirit of wine; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> was, that part only of the oil united with the spirit; the rest remaining obstinately attached to the resin which it had dissolved, and thus preventing it from assuming a solid consistence. The author next endeavoured to dissolve it by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> in Papin's digester. But neither water, nor spirit of wine, although in this way capable of dissolving the hardest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>, could produce any other effect upon it than to render it more firm than before. After this, he tried what effect the milky juice of other vegetables would have upon it. He used several kinds, particularly that of the fig. But, in this way, he could obtain no solution. From the great volatility of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a>, he was next induced to try it as a menstruum; and, for this purpose, he prepared some with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. The caoutchouc, cut into little bits, and put into a proper vessel with as much ether as was sufficient to cover it, was perfectly dissolved without any other heat than that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. This solution was transparent and of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. It still preserved the smell of ether, but mixed with the disagreeable odour of the caoutchouc, and it is a little less fluid than pure ether. Upon its being thrown into water, no milky liquor was produced; but there arose to the surface a solid membrane which possessed the great elasticity and other peculiar properties of the caoutchouc. He observes, however, that two pints of the best ether, obtained by rectifying eight or ten pints of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> ether by a gentle heat, must be used, in order to the success of the operation.\nThe distinguishing properties of this substance, viz. its solidity, flexibility, and elasticity, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of resisting the action of aqueous, spirituous, saline, oily, and other common solvents, render it extremely fit for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of tubes, catheters, and other instruments, in which these properties are wanted. In order to form this resin into small tubes, M. Macquer prepared a solid cylindrical mould of wax, of the desired size and shape; and then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIPPING\">dipping</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> into the ethereal solution of the resin, daubed the mould over with it, till he had covered it with a coat of resin of sufficient thickness. The whole piece is then thrown into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water; by the heat of which the wax is soon melted, and rises to the surface, leaving the resinous tube completely formed behind.\n\nGrosart informs us, that he has succeeded very well in employing the essential oils of turpentine and lavender as a solvent for the elastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, and thus forming it into tubes or giving it any shape that is wanted. When the elastic tube is prepared with oil of lavender, the latter may be separated by immersing the tube in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALCOHOL\">alcohol</a>, which charges itself with the oil, and becomes a good lavender water. Alcohol serves another purpose beside taking up the essential oil. It accelerates very much the drying of caoutchouc instruments, which are thus formed. Oil of turpentine appeared always to have a kind of stickiness; and the smell which could not be got rid of, by any means yet discovered, was another inconvenience.\n\nGrosart proposes another solvent, which is easily procured, and is not liable to the inconvenience <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned. This solvent is water. \"I conceive (says he) it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> appear strange to mention water as a solvent of elastic gum, that liquid having been always supposed to have no action upon it. I myself resisted the idea; but reflecting that ether, by being saturated with water, is the better enabled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> on caoutchouc, and that this gum when plunged into boiling water becomes more transparent at the edges, I presumed that this effect was not due simply to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a> of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> by the heat. I thought that, at that temperature, some action might take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and that a long-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> ebullition might produce more sensible effects. I was not disappointed in my expectations, and one of those tubes was prepared without any other solvent than water and heat. I proceeded in the same manner as with ether: the elastic gum dilates but very little in boiling water; it becomes whitish, but recovers its colour again by drying it in the air and light. It is sufficiently prepared for use when it has been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> in boiling water: by this time its edges are sometimes transparent. It is to be turned spirally round the mould, in the manner we described before, and replunged frequently into the boiling water, during the time that is employed in forming the tube, to the end that the edges may be disposed to unite together. When the whole is bound with packthread, it is to be kept some hours in boiling water; after which it is to be dried, still keeping on the binding.\n\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> we wish to be more certain that the connexion is perfect, the spiral may be doubled; but we must always avoid placing the exterior surfaces of the slips one upon the other, as those surfaces are the parts which most resist the action of solvents. This precaution is necessary when ether is employed, on account of its great action upon the caoutchouc.\n\n\"It might be feared that the action of water upon caoutchouc would deprive us of the advantages which might otherwise be expected; but these fears will be removed, if we consider that the affinities differ according to the temperatures; that it is only at a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> temperature that water exercises any sensible action upon caoutchouc. I can affirm, that at 120\u00b0 of Reaumur's thermometer (302\u00b0 of Fahrenheit) this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> is not such as that the water can give a liquid form to caoutchouc; and it does not appear that we have anything to fear in practice from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> between these two bodies, which, though it really is a true solution, does not take place in any sensible degree but at a high temperature. It is therefore at present easy to make of caoutchouc whatever instruments it may be advantageous to have of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a>, supple, and elastic substance, which is impermeable to water at the temperature of our atmosphere, and resists the action of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> as well as that of most other solvents.\n\nAs to the durability of these instruments, few substances <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> more than this, because it may be soldered afresh in a damaged part. Any woven substance may be covered with it; it is only required that the substance should be of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> not to be acted upon during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>, either by ether or by boiling water; for these two agents are those which appear to me to merit the preference. Artists will frequently find an advantage in employing ether, as it requires less time; so that a person may make, in a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, any tube he may have occasion for. The expense of ether is very little, since it is needful only to dispose the caoutchouc to adhere; and being brought into that state, the caoutchouc may be kept in a vessel perfectly well closed. It would also diminish the expense of the ether, if, instead of washing it with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of water, there should be added to it only as much water as it can take up.\"\n\nA resin similar to this was some years ago discovered by M. Poivre, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">Isle</a> of France; and there are various milky juices extracted from trees in America and elsewhere, which by previous mixtures and preparations are formed into an elastic resin, but of an inferior quality to that of Cayenne; such, for instance, are the juices obtained from the Cecropia peltata, the Ficus religiosa and Indica, &c.\n\nOf the genuine trees, those growing along the banks of the river of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMAZONS\">Amazons</a> are described by M. Condamin as attaining a very great height, being at the same time perfectly straight, and having no branches except at top, which is but small, covering no more than a circumference of ten feet. Its leaves bear some resemblance to those of the manioc: they are green on the upper part, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> beneath. The seeds are three in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, and contained in a pod consisting of three cells, not unlike those of the ricinus or palma Christi; and in each of them there is a kernel, which being stripped and boiled in water produces a thick oil or fat, answering the purpose of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> in the cookery of that country.\n\nA method of dissolving this elastic gum without ether, for the purposes of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a> or the like, is as follows: Take one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of the spirit of turpentine, and\nC A O\n\nCaoutchouc\u2014a pound of the gum cut into very small pieces; pour the turpentine into a long-necked matraf, which must be placed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> bath; throw in the gum, not all at once, but by little and little according as it is perceived to dissolve: When it is entirely dissolved, pour into the matrafs a pint of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> or linseed oil, or oil of poppies, rendered deficcative in the usual manner with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LITHARGE\">litharge</a>: Then let the whole boil for a quarter of an hour, and the preparation is finished. This would make an excellent varnish for air balloons, were it not so expensive on account of the price of the gum.\n\n\u2014Another method, invented by Mr Baldwin, is as follows. Take any quantity of the caoutchouc, as two ounces avoirdupois: cut it into small bits with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of scissors. Put a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> ladle (such as plumbers or glaziers melt their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> in) over a common pit-coal or other fire. The fire must be gentle, glowing, and without smoke. When the ladle is hot, much below a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> heat, put a single bit into the ladle. If <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> smoke issues, it will presently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> and disappear; or it will evaporate without flame: the ladle is then too hot. When the ladle is left hot, put in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> bit, which will produce a white smoke. This white smoke will continue during the operation, and evaporate the caoutchouc: therefore no time is to be lost; but little bits are to be put in, a few at a time, till the whole are melted. It should be continually and gently stirred with an iron or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> spoon. Two pounds, or one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUART\">quart</a>, of the best drying oil (or of raw linseed oil, which, together with a few drops of neats foot oil, has stood a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, or not so long, on a lump of quicklime, to make it more or less drying) is to be put into the melted caoutchouc, and stirred till hot: and the whole poured into a glazed vessel, through a coarse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAUZE\">gauze</a>, or fine sieve. When settled and clear, which will be in a few minutes, it is fit for use, either hot or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>.\n\nThe Abb\u00e9 Clavigero informs us, that the elastic gum is called by the Mexicans Olin or Olli, and by the Spaniards of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> Ule: That it diffuses from the olivierwood, which is a tree of moderate size; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of which is smooth and yellowish, the leaves pretty large, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> white, and the fruit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> and rather round, but angular; within which there are kernels as large as filberts, and white, but covered with a yellowish pellicle: That the kernel has a bitter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, and the fruit always grows attached to the bark of the tree: That when the trunk is cut, the juice which diffuses from it is white, liquid, and viscid; afterwards it becomes yellow; and lastly of a leaden colour, though rather blacker, which it always retains. The tree, he adds, is very common in the kingdom of Guatemala.\n\nDifferent trees, it would appear, yield the elastic gum. Aublet, in his Histoire des Plantes de la Guiane (p. 871.), describes the tree, the fruit, and manner of collecting the juice; but never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the flower: he calls it, however, Hevea Guianensis. In Jacquin's America, it is called Echeites Corymbosa. The younger Linn\u00e6us, in his Supplementum Plantarum (p. 422), names it Jatropha Elastica; but acknowledges that he only gives it this name from the structure of the fruit having most resemblance to that genus, his dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> wanting the flowers.\n\nOf the above gum, it is said, the Chinese make e-\n\nVol. V.

In the dedication of his edition of Shakespeare, in 1768, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Grafton, he observes; that \"his father and the grandfather of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a>, were friends, and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> of the deceased nobleman he owed the leisure which enabled him to bestow the attention of 20 years on that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>.\" The office which his grace bestowed on Mr Capell was that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a>-instructor of the plays, to which a salary is annexed of \u00a3200 a-year.\n\nSo early as the year 1745, as Mr Capell himself informs us, shocked at the licentiousness of Hanmer's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, he first projected an edition of Shakespeare, of the strictest accuracy, to be collated and published in due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, ex fide codicum. He immediately proceeded to collect and compare the oldest and rarest copies; noting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> excellencies and defects of the rarest quartos, and distinguishing the improvements <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> variations of the first, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, and third folios; and after many years labour produced a very beautiful small octavo, in 10 volumes, with an \"Introduction.\" There is not, the authors of the Monthly Review observe, among the various publications of the present literary era, a more singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> than that \"Introduction.\" In style and manner it is more obsolete and antique than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of which it treats. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Herbert of Cherbury, walking the new pavement in all the trappings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANCE\">romance</a>; but, like Lord Herbert, it displays many valuable qualities accompanying this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of extravagance, much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, and appropriate erudition. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>-page of \"Mr William Shakespeare, his Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies,\" it was also announced and promulgated, \"Whereunto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be added, in some other volumes, notes critical and explanatory, and a body of various readings entire.\" \"The Introduction\" likewise declared, that these \"notes and various readings\" would be accompanied with another work, disclosing the sources from which Shakespeare \"drew the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his knowledge in mythological and classical matters, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a>, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, and even the seeming peculiarities of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>\u2014to which,\" says Mr Capell, \"we have given for title, The School of Shakespeare.\" Nothing surely could be more properly conceived than such designs; nor have we ever met with any thing better grounded on the subject of \"the learning of Shakespeare\" than what may be found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> to this part of Mr Capell's Introduction. It is more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> than even the popular \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a>\" on this topic. Certain quaintnesses of style, and peculiarities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNCTUATION\">punctuation</a>, attended the whole of this publication. The outline, however, was correct; and the critic, with unremitting toil, proceeded in his undertaking. But while he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVING\">diving</a> into the classics of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAXTON\">Caxton</a> (to continue the Reviewers account), and working his way under ground, like the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOLE\">Mole</a>, in order to emerge with all his glories; while he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> forward to his triumphs, certain other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> spirits went to work upon his plan; and, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a> out the promised treasures, laid them prematurely before the public, defeating the effect of our critic's discoveries by anticipation. Stevens, Malone, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">Farmer</a>, Percy, Reed, and a whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOST\">host</a> of literary ferrets, burrowed into every hole and corner of the warren of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> antiquity, and overrun all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, whose map had been delineated by Edward Capell. Such a contingency nearly flagged the steady and unshaken perseverance of our critic, at the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVE\">eve</a> of the completion of his labours, and as his editor informs us\u2014for, alas! at the end of near 40 years, the publication was posthumous, and the critic himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more!\u2014he was almost determined to lay the work wholly aside. He persevered, however, by the encouragement of some noble and worthy persons; and to such their encouragement, and his perseverance, the public was, in 1783, indebted for three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> volumes in 4to, under the title of \"Notes and various readings of Shakespeare; together with the School of Shakespeare, or Extracts from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> English Books, that were in print in the Author's time; evidently flowing from whence his several Fables were taken, and some parcel of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALOGUE\">Dialogue</a>.

Hence it is easy to conceive how sensibly such a power must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> on the surface of a fluid, not viscid, as water, contained within the small cavity or bore of a glass tube; as also that it will be proportionably stronger as the diameter of the bore is smaller; for it will be evident that the efficacy of the power is in the inverse proportion of the diameter, when it is considered, that such particles only as are in contact with the fluid, and those immediately above the surface, can effect it.\n\nNow these particles form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIPHERY\">periphery</a> contiguous to the surface, the upper part of which attracts and raises the surface, while the lower part, which is in contact with it, supports it: so that neither the thickness nor length of the tube is of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> here; the periphery of particles only, which is always proportionable to the diameter of the bore, is the only acting power. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of the fluid raised will therefore be as the surface of the bore which it fills, that is, as the diameter; for otherwise the effect would not be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the cauld, since the quantities are always as the ratio of the diameters; the heights therefore to which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> will rise, in different tubes, will be inversely as the diameters.\n\nSome doubt whether the law holds throughout, of the ascent of the fluid being always higher as the tube is smaller; Dr Hook's experiments, with tubes almost as fine as cobwebs, seem to show the contrary. The water in these, he observes, did not rise so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as one would have expected. The highest he ever found it, was at 21 inches above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the water in the basin; which is much short of what it ought to have been by the law above mentioned. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COHESION\">Cohesion</a>.\n\n**Capillary Vessels.** Many small vessels of animal bodies have been discovered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of injecting the vessels of animals with a coloured fluid, which upon cooling grows hard. But though most anatomists know the manner of filling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> trunks, few are acquainted with the art of filling the capillaries.

It is a very ancient kind of tribute. The Latins call it tributum, by which taxes on persons are distinguished from taxes on merchandise, which were called vexigalia.\n\nCapitations are never practised among us but in exigencies of state. In France the capitation was introduced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIV. in 1695; and is a tax very different from the taille, being levied from all persons, whether they be subject to the taille or not.

They were supposed to have been thus called, because they were rather counted and marshalled by their heads than by their estates. The capite censi made part of the sixth class of citizens, being below the proletarii, who formed the other moiety of that class. They were not enrolled in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, as being judged not able to support the expense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>; for in those days the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> maintained themselves.

His successor Servius raised the walls; and Tarquin the Proud finished it in the year 221. But it was not consecrated till the third year after the expulsion of the kings, and establishment of the consulship. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> of the dedication of the temple was performed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a> Horatius in 246.\n\nThe capitol consisted of three parts; a nave sacred to Jupiter, and two wings, the one consecrated to Juno, the other to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a>: it was ascended by stairs; the frontispiece and sides were surrounded with galleries, in which those who were honoured with triumphs entertained the senate at a magnificent banquet, after the sacrifice had been offered to the gods.\n\nBoth the inside and outside were enriched with an infinity of ornaments, the most distinguished of which was the statue of Jupiter with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> thunderbolt, his sceptre, and crown. In the capitol also were a temple to Jupiter the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">Guardian</a>, and another to Juno, with the mint; and on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of the hill was the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCORD\">Concord</a>. This beautiful edifice contained the most sacred deposits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, such as the ancilia, the books of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIBYLS\">Sibyls</a>, &c.\n\nThe capitol was burnt under Vitellius, and rebuilt under Vespasian. It was burnt a second time by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a> under Titus, and restored by Domitian.\n\nAnciently the name capitoli was likewise applied to all the principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> in most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> throughout the Roman empire; as at Constantinople, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAVENNA\">Ravenna</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPUA\">Capua</a>, &c.\u2014That of Thoulouse has given the name of capitouls to the echevins or sheriffs.","sp":170,"ep":171},{"h":"CAPITOLINE GAMES","t":"annual games instituted by Camillus, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> Capitolinus, and in commemoration of the capitol's not being taken by the Gauls.

His successor preferred it to every other residence; and in order to vary his pleasures, and enjoy the advantages as well as avoid the inconveniences of each revolving season, built 12 villas in different situations, dedicated to the 12 greater gods: the ruins of some of them are still to be seen: at Santa <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARIA\">Maria</a> are extensive vaults and reservoirs; and on an adjoining brow are the remains of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTHOUSE\">lighthouse</a>; two broken columns indicate the entrance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>.

The first species is called ornii, from the old Greek erinos, which answers to caprificus in Latin, and signifies a wild fig-tree. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> is the domestic or garden fig-tree. The former bears successively, in the same year, three sorts of fruit, called fornites, cratitires, and ornii; which, though not good to eat, are found absolutely necessary towards ripening those of the garden fig. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> have a fleck even skin; are of a deep green <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>; and contain in their dry and mealy inside several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> placed upon distinct footstalks, the former above the latter. The fornites appear in August, and continue to November without ripening: in these are bred small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>, which turn to a sort of gnats nowhere to be seen but about these trees. In October and November, these gnats of themselves make a puncture into the second fruit, which is called cratitires. They do not show themselves till towards the end of September. The fornites gradually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> away after the gnats are gone; the cratitires, on the contrary, remain on the tree till May, and enclose the eggs deposited by the gnats when they pricked them. In May, the third sort of fruit, called ornii, begins to be produced by the wild fig-trees. This is much bigger than the other two; and when it grows to a certain size, and its bud begins to open, it is pricked in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> by the gnats of the cratitires, which are strong enough to go from one fruit to another to deposit their eggs. It sometimes happens that the gnats of the cratitires are slow to come forth in certain parts, while the ornii in those very parts are disposed to receive them. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the husbandman is obliged to look for the cratitires in another part, and fix them at the ends of the branches of those fig-trees whose ornii are in a fit disposition to be pricked by the gnats. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> they miss the opportunity, the ornii fall, and the gnats of the cratitires fly away. None but those that are well acquainted with the culture know the critical moment of doing this; and in order to know it, their eye is perpetually fixed on the bud of the fig; for that part not only indicates the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that the prickers are to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> forth, but also when the fig is to be successfully pricked; if the bud is too hard and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a>, the gnat cannot lay its eggs; and the fig drops when the bud is too open.\n\n\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of all these three sorts of fruit is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIPEN\">ripen</a> the fruit of the garden fig-tree, in the following manner: During the mouths of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>, the peasants take the ornii, at the time their gnats are ready to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> out, and carry them to the garden fig-trees; if they do not nick the moment, the ornii fall; and the fruit of the domestic fig-tree, not ripening, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> in a very little time fall in like manner. The peasants are so well acquainted with these precious moments, that every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, in making their inspection, they only transfer to their garden fig-trees such ornii as are well conditioned, otherwise they lose their crop. In this case, however, they have one remedy, though an indifferent one; which is, to strew over the garden fig-trees another plant in whose fruit there is also a species of gnats which answer the purpose in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>.\"\n\nThe caprification of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, described by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEOPHRASTUS\">Theophrastus</a>, Plutarch, Pliny, and other authors of antiquity, corresponds in every circumstance with what is practised at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> in the Archipelago and in Italy. These all agree in declaring, that the wild fig-tree, caprificus, never ripened its fruit; but was absolutely necessary for ripening that of the garden or domestic fig, over which the husbandman suspended its branches. The reason of this success has been supposed to be, that by the punctures of these insects the vessels of the fruit are lacerated, and thereby a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of nutritious juice derived thither. Perhaps, too, in depositing their eggs, the gnats leave behind them some sort of liquor proper to ferment gently with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> of the figs, and to make their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> tender. The figs in Provence, and even at Paris, ripen much sooner for having their buds pricked with a straw dipped in olive-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>. Plums and pears likewise, pricked by some insects, ripen much the faster for it; and the flesh round such puncture is better taffed than the rest. It is not to be disputed, that considerable changes happen to the texture of fruits so pricked, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> the same as to parts of animals pierced with any sharp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>. Others have supposed that these insects penetrated the fruit of the tree to which they were brought, and gave a more free admission to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>. Linnaeus explained the operation, by supposing that the insects brought the farina from the wild fig, which contained male flowers only, to the domestic fig, which contained the female ones. Hafelquist, from what he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a>, seemed to doubt of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of fructification. M. Bernard, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a>, opposes it more decidedly. He could never find the insect in the cultivated fig; and, in reality, it appeared to leave the wild fig, after the flamina were mature, and their pollen dissipated: besides, he adds, what they may have brought on their wings must be rubbed away, in the little aperture which they would form for themselves. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a>, where there are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> or eight varieties of the domestic fig, this operation is only performed on those which ripen latest: the former are of a proper size, fine flavour, and in great abundance without it; so that he thinks the caprification only hampers the ripening.\nCaprimul. ripening. He examined the parts of fructification of the fig; and he observes, if this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> be made previous to the ripening, that round the eye of the fig, and in the subfance of its covering, may be seen triangular dentated leaves, prefed one against another; and under these leaves are the flamina, whose pollen is defined for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPREGNATION\">impregnation</a> of the grains, which fill the rest of the fruit. These male organs are much more numerous in the wild fig than in the domestic; and the flamina are found to contain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> dust, which may be collected when it is ripe. The wild figs, when ripe, are not succulent, and have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, though the grains are disposed in the same manner as in the other kind. The pith of the grain of the wild fruit serves as food to a species of the cynips, whose larva is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, till the moment of its transformation; and it is by an opening, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PISTIL\">pistil</a>, that the insect penetrates the grain. From this account it is thought probable that the insect is only communicated by accident to the domestic fig, and that the flowers of this genus are sometimes hermaphrodites. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of hermaphrodite flowers being fewer on the cultivated than on the wild fig, the seeds are fecundated more certainly and quickly by the capricious; and every botanist knows, that when the impregnation is completed, the flower soon withers; while, if by any accident it is delayed, it continues in bloom much longer. This view of the subject, therefore, explains very completely the reason why, in Malta, the capricious is practised on the late kind of figs, because it hastens the formation and maturity of the fruit.","sp":176,"ep":177},{"h":"CAPRIOLLES","t":"in the Manege, leaps that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> makes in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> without advancing, in such a manner, that, when he is at the height of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAP\">leap</a>, he jerks out with his hinder legs even and near.

It is let perpendicularly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> through the decks of a ship; and is fixed in such a manner, that the men, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> it horizontally with their bars, may perform any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> which requires an extraordinary effort.\n\nA capstern is composed of several parts, where A is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a>, b the whelps, c the drumhead, and d the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINDLE\">spindle</a>. The whelps rise out from the main body of the capstern like buttresses, to enlarge the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEEP\">sweep</a>, so that a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of cable, or whatever rope encircles the barrel, may be wound about it at one turn, without adding much to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of the capstern. The whelps reach downwards from the lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the drumhead to the deck. The drumhead is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> cylindrical piece of wood resembling a mill-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, and fixed immediately above the barrel and whelps. On the outside of this piece are cut a number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> holes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the deck to receive the bars. The spindle or pivot d, which is fitted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, is the axis or foot upon which the capstern rests, and turns round in the saucer, which is a sort of iron socket let into a wooden stock or standard called the flop, resting upon and bolted to the beams.\n\nBesides the different parts of the capstern above explained, it is furnished with several appurtenances, as the bars, the pins, the pawls, the swifter, and the saucer, already described. The bars are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> pieces of wood, or arms, thrust into a number of square holes in the drumhead all round, in which they are as the radius of a circle, or the spokes in the nave of a wheel. They are used to heave the capstern round, which is done by the men setting their breasts against them, and walking about, like the machinery of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> mill, till the operation is finished.\u2014The pins e, are little bolts of iron thrust perpendicularly through the holes of the drumhead, and through a correspondent hole in the end of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>, made to receive the pins when the bars are fixed. They are used to confine the bars, and to prevent them from working out as the men heave, or when the ship labours. Every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> is fastened to the drumhead with a small iron chain; and that the bars may exactly fit their respective holes, they are all numbered.\u2014The pawls f, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a>. 1, are situated on each side the capstern, being two short bars of iron, bolted at one end through the deck to the beams <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the lower part of the whelps; the other end which occasionally turns round on the deck, being placed in the intervals of the whelps, as the capstern turns round, prevents it from recoiling or turning back by any sudden jerk of the cable, as the ship rises on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, which might greatly endanger the men who heave. There are also hanging pawls gg, No. 3, used for the same purpose, reaching from the deck above to the drumhead immediately below it. The swifter is a rope passed horizontally through holes in the outer end of the bars, and drawn very tight; the intent of this is to keep the men steady as they walk round when the ship rocks, and to give room for a greater number to assist by pulling upon the swifter itself.\n\nThe most frequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the capstern is to heave in the cable, and thereby remove the ship or draw up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCHOR\">anchor</a>. It is also used to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> up any weighty body, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASTS\">masts</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>, &c.

This is represented in No. 3. The latter is represented in No. 2.\n\nFormerly the bars of the capstern went entirely through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of it, and consequently were more than double the length of the present ones; the holes were therefore formed at different heights, as represented in No. 1. But this machine had several inconveniences, and has long been entirely disused in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>. Some of these sort of capsterns, however, are still retained in merchant ships, and are usually denominated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CRABS\">crabs</a>. The situation of the bars in a crab, as ready for heaving, is represented in No. 4.\n\nTo rig the CAPSTERN, is to fix the bars in their respective holes, and thrust in the pins, in order to confine them.\u2014Surge the CAPSTERN, is the order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLACKEN\">slacken</a> the rope heaved round upon it, of which there are generally two turns and a half about the barrel at once, and sometimes three turns.\u2014To Heave the CAPSTERN, is to go round with it heaving on the bars, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> in any rope of which the purchase is created.\u2014To Come-up the CAPSTERN, is to let go the rope upon which they had been heaving.\u2014To Pawl the CAPSTERN, is to fix the pawls to prevent it from recoiling during any pause of heaving.","sp":178,"ep":178},{"h":"CAPSULE","t":"among botanists, a dry hollow seed-vessel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> pericarpium, that cleaves or splits in some determinate manner.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of Capua is thus shortly deduced by Mr Swinburne. \"It was a settlement of the Osci long before the foundation of Rome. As the amazing fertility of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> and a lucrative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> poured immense wealth upon its inhabitants, it became one of the most extensive and magnificent cities in the world. With <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> excessive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> crept in, and the Capuans grew insolent; but by their effeminacy they soon lost the power of repelling those neighbouring nations which their insolence had exasperated. For this reason Capua was continually exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of calling for foreign aid, and endangering its safety by the uncommon temptations it offered to needy auxiliaries. The Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> sent to defend Capua were on the point of making it their prey, and often the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of the Roman people was loud for a removal from the barren unwholesome banks of the Tiber to the garden of Italy, near those of the Volturnus. Through well-founded jealousy of the ambition of Rome, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a>, as Livy and other partial writers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> it, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> inconstancy,\nthe Capuans warmly espoused the quarrel of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a>: Hannibal made Capua his winter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> of Cannae; and there, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we are to believe historians, his rough and hitherto invincible soldiers were enervated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> and indolence.\n\n\"When through a failure of supplies from Carthage Hannibal was under a necessity of remaining in Bruttium, and leaving the Capuans to defend themselves, this city, which had been long invested, was surrendered at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a> to the consuls Appius Claudius and Q. Fulvius Flaccus. The senators were put to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a> imprisoned for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, and all the citizens sold and dispersed. Vibius, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of Hannibal's friends, avoided this ignominious fate, and escaped from the cruel vengeance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> by a voluntary death.\n\n\u2014When the mob inflicted upon the gates being thrown open to the enemy, Vibius assembled his heady associates, and sat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> with them to a superb banquet, after which each of the guests swallowed a poisonous draught, and expired in full possession of their freedom. The buildings were spared by the victor; and Capua was left to be merely a harbour for the husbandmen of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, a warehouse for goods, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANARY\">granary</a> for corn; but so advantageous a situation could not long be neglected; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> were sent to inhabit it, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> it regained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of importance.\n\n\"Genetrix the Vandal was more cruel than the Roman conquerors had been; for he massacred the inhabitants, and burnt the town to the ground.

Lewis was born in 1555; and was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a>-german to Augustine and Hannibal, who were brothers, the sons of a taylor, who was yet careful to give them a liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>. They were both disciples of Caracci, their cousin Lewis. Augustine gained a knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, music, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, and most of the liberal arts; but, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> pursuit, he learned the art of engraving from Cornelius Cort, and surpassed all the masters of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. Hannibal, again, never deviated from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a>. These three painters, at length, having reaped all the advantages they could by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> and practice, formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> always together, and laid the foundation of that celebrated school which has ever since been known by the name of Caracci's academy. Hither all the young students, who had a view of becoming masters, resorted to be instructed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of painting; and here the Caracci taught freely, and without reserve, all that came. Lewis's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> was to make a collection of antique <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> and bas-reliefs. They had designs of the best masters, and a collection of curious books on all subjects relating to their art; and they had a skilful anatomist always ready to teach what belonged to the knitting and motions of the muscles, &c. There were often disputations in the academy; and not only painters, but men of learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a>, proposed questions, which were always decided by Lewis. Every body was well received; and though flattered hours were allotted to treat of different matters, yet improvements might be made at all hours by the antiquities and the designs which were to be seen.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of the Caracci reaching Rome, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">cardinal</a> Farnese sent for Hannibal thither, to paint the gallery of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>. Hannibal was the more willing to go, because he had a great desire to see Raphael's works, with the antique statues and bas-reliefs. The gusto which he took there from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>, made him change his Bolognian manner for one more learned but less natural in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> and in the colouring. Augustine followed Hannibal, to assist him in his undertaking of the Farnese gallery; but the brothers not rightly agreeing, Farnese sent Augustine to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Parma, where he died in the year 1602, being only 45 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. His most celebrated piece of painting is that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNION\">Communion</a> of St Jerome, in Bologna.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> while, Hannibal continued working in the Farnese gallery at Rome; and, after inconceivable pains and care, finished the paintings in the perfection in which they are now to be seen. He hoped that the cardinal would have rewarded him in some proportion to the excellence of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, and the time it took him up, which was eight years; but he was disappointed. The cardinal, influenced by an ignorant Spaniard, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a>, gave him but a little above 200l. though it is certain he deserved more than twice as many thousands. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> was brought him, he was so surprized at the injustice done him, that he could not speak a word to the person who brought it. This confirmed him in a melancholy to which his temper naturally inclined, and made him resolve never more to touch his pencil; which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> he had undoubtedly kept <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> his necessities had not compelled him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> it. It is said, that his melancholy gained so much upon him, that at certain times it deprived him of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of his senses. It did not, however, put a stop to his amours; and his debauches at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>, whither he had retired for\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, brought a distemper upon him, of which he died in 1629, when he was 49 years of age. His veneration for Raphael was so great, that it was his deathbed request to be buried in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a> with him; which was accordingly done, in the pantheon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> rotunda at Rome. There are extant several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a> of the blest Virgin, and some other subjects, etched by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of this incomparable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>. He is said to have been a friendly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, honest, and open-hearted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; very communicative to his scholars, and so extremely kind to them, that he generally kept his money in the same box with his colours, where they might have recourse to either as they had occasion.\n\nWhile Hannibal Caracci worked at Rome, Lewis was courted from all parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOMBARDY\">Lombardy</a>, especially by the clergy, to make pictures in their churches; and we may judge of his capacity and facility, by the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of pictures he made, and by the preference that was given him to other painters. In the midst of these employments Hannibal solicited him to come and assist him in the Farnese gallery; and so earnestly, that he could not avoid complying with his request. He went to Rome; corrected several things in that gallery; painted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> or two himself; and then returned to Bologna, where he died in 1619, aged 64.","sp":182,"ep":183},{"h":"CARACOL","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, denotes a staircase in a helix <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> spiral form.","sp":183,"ep":183},{"h":"CARACOLI","t":"a kind of metal of which the Caribbeans, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> natives of the Lesser <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANTILLES\">Antilles</a>, make a sort of ornament in the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRESCENT\">crescent</a>, which they also call caracoli.\u2014This metal comes from the main <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> is, that it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> of silver, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, something like the Corinthian bras among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>.

Aben <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EZRA\">Ezra</a>, and some other rabbins, treat the Caraites as Sadducees; but Leo de Juda calls them, more accurately, Sadducees reformed; because they believe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>, paradise, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELL\">hell</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESURRECTION\">resurrection</a>, &c., which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Sadducees denied. He adds, however, that they were doubtless originally real Sadducees, and sprung from among them.\n\nM. Simon, with more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, supposes them to have risen hence; that the more knowing among the Jews opposing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> and reveries of the rabbins, and using the pure texts of Scripture to refute their groundless traditions, had the name of Caraim given them; which signifies as much as the barbarous Latin Scripturarius; i.e., people attached to the text of Scripture. The other Jews gave them the odious name Sadducees, from their agreement with those sectaries on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of traditions.

Josephus and Philo make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> mention of them; which shows them to be more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> than either of those authors. In all probability, this fact was not formed till after the collection of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALMUD\">Talmud</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the Gemara; perhaps not till after the compiling of the Mishnah in the third century. The Cara\u00eftes themselves pretend to be the remains of the ten tribes led captive by Shalmaneser. Wolfius, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of Mardacheus, a Cara\u00efte, refers their origin to a massacre among the Jewish doctors, under Alexander Janneus, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, about 100 years before Christ: because Simeon, son of Schetach, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, making his escape into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, there forged his pretended traditions; and, at his return to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, published his visions; interpolating the law after his own fancy, and supporting his novelties on the notices which God, he said, had communicated by the mouth of Moses, whose depository he was: he gained many followers; and was opposed by others, who maintained, that all which God had revealed to Moses was written. Hence the Jews became divided into two sects, the Cara\u00eftes and Tradionaries: among the first, Juda, son of Tabba\u00ef, distinguished himself; among the latter, Hillel. Wolfius reckons not only the Sadducees, but also the Scribes, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of Cara\u00eftes. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> of the Pharisees prevailed against them all; and the number of Cara\u00eftes decreased: Anan, indeed, in the eighth century, retrieved their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> a little; and Rabbi Schalom in the ninth. They succeeded pretty well till the fourteenth; but since that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> they have been declining.\n\nThe Cara\u00eftes are but little known; their works coming only into very few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, even among the greatest Hebraists. Buxtorf never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> more than one; Selden two; but Mr Trigland says, he has recovered enough to speak of them with assurance. He affirms, that soon after the prophets had ceased, the Jews became divided on the subject of works, and supererogation: some maintaining their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>; whilst others, keeping <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the written law, set them aside; and it was from these last that Caraitism commenced. He adds, that after the return from the Babylonian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a>, the observation of the law being to be re-established, there were several practices found proper for that end; and these once introduced, were looked upon as essential, and appointed by Moses; which was the origin of Pharisaism: as a contrary party, continuing to keep close to the letter, founded Caraitism.\n\nThe modern Cara\u00eftes, Leo of Modena observes, have their synagogues and ceremonies; they pretend to be the sole proper Jews, or observers of the laws of Moses; calling the rest by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> Rabbanim, or followers of the Rabbins: these hate the Cara\u00eftes mortally; refusing to ally or even to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> with them, and treating them as mamzeim, bastards; because of their rejecting the constitutions of the rabbins relating to marriages, repudiations, purifications of women, &c. This aversion is so great, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> a Cara\u00efte should become a Rabbinist, he would never be received by the other Jews.\n\nThe Cara\u00eftes, however, do not absolutely reject all kinds of traditions; but only such as do not appear well grounded. Selden, who is very express on this point, in his Uxor Hebraica, observes, that, besides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> text, they have certain interpretations, which they call <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>, and which are proper traditions. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a> only seems to differ from that of the other Jews, in that it is purer, and clearer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>: they give no credit to the explications of the Cabalistic, chimerical allegories, nor to any constitutions of the Talmud, but what are conformable to the Scripture, and may be drawn from it by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> and necessary consequences.\n\nPeringer observes of the Cara\u00eftes in Lithuania, that they are very different, both in aspect, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, and manners, from the Rabbinites, whereewith the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> abounds. Their mother tongue is the Turkifh; and this they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> and synagogues. In visage they resemble the Mahometan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a>. Their synagogues are placed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> and south; and the reason they give for it is, that Shalmaneser brought them northward: so that in praying, to look to Jerusalem, they must turn to the south. He adds, that they admit all the books of the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>; contrary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of many of the learned, who hold that they reject all but the Pentateuch.\n\nCaleb, a Cara\u00efte, reduces the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between them and the Rabbinites to three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>: 1.

In 1524, he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PADUA\">Padua</a>; and the same year he was admitted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of arts: in the end of the following year, he took the degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> of physic. He married about the year 1531. For ten years before, his impotency had hindered him from having knowledge of a woman; which was a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> to him. He attributed it to the evil influences of his planet under which he was born. When he enumerates, as he frequently does, the greatest misfortunes of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, this ten years impotency is always one. At the age of 32, he became professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> at Milan. In 1539, he was admitted member of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> of physicians at Milan; in 1543, he read public lectures of medicine in that city, and at Pavia the year following; but discontinued them because he could not get payment of his salary, and returned to Milan. In 1552, he went into Scotland, having been sent for by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of St Andrew's, who had in vain applied to the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s physicians, and afterwards to those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> of Germany. This prelate, then 40 years old, had for ten years been afflicted with a shortness of breath, which returned every eight days for the last two years. He began to recover from the moment that Cardan prescribed for him. Cardan took his leave of him at the end of six weeks and\nCardan's journey to Scotland gave him an opportunity of visiting several countries. He crossed France in going thither; and returned through Germany, and the Low Countries, along the banks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a>. It was on this occasion, he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, and calculated King Edward's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATIVITY\">nativity</a>. This tour took up about four months: after which, coming back to Milan, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> there till the beginning of October 1552; and then went to Pavia, from whence he was invited to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a> in 1562. He taught in this last city till the year 1570; at which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he was thrown into prison; but some months after he was sent home to his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>. He left Bologna in 1573; and went to Rome, where he lived for some time without any public employment. He was however, admitted a member of the college of physicians, and received a pension from the pope. He died at Rome on the 21st of September 1575, according to Thuanus. This account might be sufficient to show the reader that Cardan was of a very fickle temper; but he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> have a much better idea of his singular and odd turn of mind by examining what he himself has written concerning his own good and bad qualities. He paid himself congratulatory compliments for not having a friend in this world; but that in requital, he was attended by an aerial spirit, emanated partly from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a> and partly from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a>, who was the constant guide of his actions, and teacher of every duty to which he was bound. He declared, too, that he was so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> in his manner of walking the streets, as induced all beholders to point at him as a fool. Sometimes he walked very slowly, like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> absorbed in profound meditation; then all on a sudden quickened his steps, accompanying them with very absurd attitudes. In Bologna his delight was to be drawn about in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> vehicle with three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a>. When <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> did not visit him with any pain, he would procure to himself that disagreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> by biting his lips to wantonly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> pulling his fingers to such a vehement degree, as sometimes to force the tears from his eyes: and the reason he affirmed for so doing, was to moderate certain impetuous fallies of the mind, the violence of which was to him far more insupportable than pain itself; and that the sure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of such a severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> was the enjoying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>. He says elsewhere, that, in the greatest tortures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>, he used to whip his legs with rods, and bit his left arm; that it was a great relief to him to weep, but that very often he could not; that nothing gave him more pleasure than to talk of things which made the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> uneasy; that he spoke on all subjects, in season and out of season; and he was so fond of games of chance, as to spend whole days in them, to the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> and reputation, for he even staked his furniture and his wife's jewels.\n\nCardanus makes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> scruple of owning that he was revengeful, envious, treacherous, a dealer in the black-art, a backbiter, a calumniator, and addicted to all the foul and detestable excesses that can be imagined: yet, notwithstanding (as one would think) so humbling a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a>, there was never perhaps a vainer mortal, or one that with less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> expressed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> he had of himself, than Cardanus was known to do, as will appear by the following proofs. \"I have been admired by many nations: an infinite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of panegyrics, both in prose and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>, have been composed to celebrate my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>. I was born to relieve the world from the manifold errors under which it groaned. What I have found out could not be discovered either by my predecessors or my contemporaries; and that is the reason why those authors who write anything worthy of being remembered, scruple not to own that they are indebted to me for it. I have composed a book on the dialectic art, in which there is neither one superfluous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> nor one deficient. I finished it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> days, which seems a prodigy. Yet where is there a person to be found, that can boast of his having become master of its doctrine in a year? And he that shall have comprehended it in that time, must appear to have been instructed by a familiar daemon.\"\n\nThe same capriciousness observable in his outward conduct is to be observed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of his works. We have a multitude of his treatises in which the reader is stopped almost every moment by the obscurity of his text, or his digressions from the point in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. In his arithmetical performances there are several discourses on the motions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>, and on the tower of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BABEL\">Babel</a>. In his dialectic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, we find his judgment on the historians and the writers of epistles. The only apology which he makes for the frequency of his digressions is, that they were purposely done for the sooner filling up of his sheet, his bargain with the bookseller being at so much per sheet; and that he worked as much for his daily support as for the acquisition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>. The Lyons edition of his works, printed in 1663, consists of ten volumes in folio.\n\nIt was Cardanus who revived in latter times all the secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> of the Cabbala or Cabalistics, which filled the world with spirits; a likeness to whom, he affected, we might attain by purifying ourselves with philosophy. He chose for himself, however, notwithstanding such reveries, this fine device, Tempus mea poesia, tempus meus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGER\">ager</a>: \"Time is my sole possession, and the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> I have to improve.\"\n\nIn fact, when we consider the transcendent qualities of Cardan's mind, we cannot deny his having cultivated it with every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of knowledge, and his having made a greater progress in philosophy, in the medical art, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, in mathematics, &c. than the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his contemporaries who had applied their minds but to one of those sciences.\n\nScaliger affirms, that Cardan, having fixed the time of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, abstained from food, that this prediction might be fulfilled, and that his continuance to live might not discredit his art. Cardan's father, who was a doctor of medicine, and a professor of civil and canon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, died in the same manner in the year 1524, having abstained from all sustenance for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> days.

In the primitive church, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> priest of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>, who immediately followed the bishop, was called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESBYTER\">presbyter</a> cardinalis, to distinguish him from the other petty priests, who had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> church nor preferment; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> was first applied to them in the year 150; others say, under Pope Silvester, in the year 300. These cardinal priests were alone allowed to baptize, and administer the eucharist. When the cardinal priests became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, their cardinalate became vacant; they being then supposed to be raised to a higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>.\u2014Under Pope Gregory, cardinal priests, and cardinal deacons, were only such priests and deacons as had a church or chapel under their particular care: and this was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> use of the word. Leo IV. in the council of Rome, held in 853, calls them presbyteros sui cardinalis; and their churches, parochias cardinalis.\n\nThe cardinals <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> on this footing till the eleventh century: but as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> and state of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a> became then exceedingly augmented, he would have his council of cardinals make a better <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> priests had done. It is true, they still preserved their ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>; but the thing expressed by it was no more. It was a good while, however, before they had the precedence over bishops, or got the election of the pope into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>: but when they were once possessed of those privileges, they soon had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> hat and purple; and growing still in authority, they became at length superior to the bishops, by the sole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of being cardinals.\n\nDu Cange observes, that originally there were three kinds of churches: the first or genuine churches were properly called parishes; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> deanories, which were chapels joined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>, and served by deacons; the third were simple oratories, where private masses were said, and were discharged by local and resident chaplains. He adds, that to distinguish the principal or parish churches from the chapels and oratories, the name cardinales was given to them. Accordingly, parish churches gave titles to cardinal priests; and some chapels also, at length, gave the title of cardinal deacons.\n\nOthers observe, that the term cardinal was given not only to priests, but also to bishops and deacons who were attached to certain churches, to distinguish them from those who only served them en pa\u00dfant, and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TITULAR\">Titular</a> churches, or benefices, were a kind of parishes, i.e., churches, assigned each to a cardinal priest; with some stated district depending on it, and a font for administering of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> where the bishop himself could not administer it. These cardinals were subordinate to the bishops; and according, Cardinally, in councils, particularly that held at Rome in 868, subscribed after them.\n\nIt was not, however, only at Rome, that priests bore this name; for we find there were cardinal priests in France: thus, the curate of the parish of St John de Vignes is called in old charters the cardinal priest of that parish.\n\nThe title of cardinal is also given to some bishops, quatenus bishops; e.g., to those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENTZ\">Mentz</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOURGES\">Bourges</a> is also, in ancient writings, called cardinal; and the church of Bourges, a cardinal church. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABBOT\">abbot</a> of Vendome calls himself cardinalis natus.\n\nThe cardinals are divided into three classes or orders; containing six bishops, fifty priests, and fourteen deacons; making in all seventy: which constitute what they call the sacred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>. The cardinal bishops, who are, as it were, the pope's vicars, bear the titles of the bishoprics assigned to them; the rest take such titles as are given them: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of cardinal bishops has been fixed; but that of cardinal priests and deacons, and consequently the sacred college itself, is always fluctuating. Till the year 1125, the college only consisted of fifty-two or fifty-three: the council of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTANCE\">Constance</a> reduced them to twenty-four; but Sixtus IV. without any regard to that restriction, raised them again to fifty-three, and Leo to sixty-five. Thus, as the number of cardinal priests was anciently fixed to twenty-eight, new titles were to be established, in proportion as new cardinals were created. As for the cardinal deacons, they were originally no more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> for the fourteen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of Rome; but they were afterwards increased to nineteen, and after that were again diminished.\n\nAccordingly to Onuphrius, it was Pope Pius IV. who first enacted, in 1562, that of the pope should be chosen only by the senate of cardinals; whereas, till that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, the election was by all the clergy of Rome. Some say, the election of the pope reposed in the cardinals, exclusive of the clergy, in the time of Alexander III. in 1160. Others go higher still, and say, that Nicholas II. having been elected at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIENNA\">Sienna</a>, in 1058, by the cardinals alone, occasioned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of election to be taken from the clergy and people of Rome; only leaving them that of confirming him by their consent; which was at length, however, taken from them. See his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> for this purpose, issued in the Roman council of 1059, in Hardouin's Acta Conciliorum, tom. vi. pt. i. p. 1165. Whence it appears, that the cardinals who had the right of suffrage in the election of his successors, were divided by this pontiff into cardinal bishops and cardinal clerks: meaning by the former the seven bishops who belonged to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> and territory of Rome; and by the latter, the cardinal presbyters, or ministers of the twenty-eight Roman parishes, or principal churches. To these were added, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time, under Alexander III. and other pontiffs, new members, in order to appease the tumults occasioned by the edict of Nicholas II.\n\nAt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> of a new cardinal, the pope performs the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> of opening and shutting his mouth; which is done in a private confessor. The shutting his mouth implies the depriving him of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of giving his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> in congregations; and the opening\nCardinal his mouth, which is performed 15 days after, signifies the taking off his restraint. However, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the pope happens to die during the time a cardinal's mouth is shut, he can neither give his voice in the election of a new pope, nor be himself advanced to that dignity.\n\nThe dress of a cardinal is a red fountaine, a rocket, a short purple mantle, and a red hat.\n\nThe cardinals began to wear the red hat at the council of Lyons, in 1243. The decree of Pope Urban VIII, whereby it is appointed, that the cardinals be addressed under the title of eminence, is of the year 1630; till then, they were called illuftrifimi.\n\nWhen cardinals are sent to the courts of princes, it is in quality of legates \u00e0 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-LATERE\">latere</a>; and when they are appointed governors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> is called by the name of legation.\n\nCardinal has also been applied to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> officers. Thus, the prime ministers in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Theodosius, are called cardinales. Cassiodorus, lib. vii. formul. 31, makes mention of the cardinal prince of the city of Rome; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of officers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Bretagne, in 1447, we meet with one Raoul de Thorel, cardinal of Quillart, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> of the vicount de Rohan; which shows it to have been an inferior quality.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARDIOID\">Cardioid</a>, in the higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, an algebraical curve, so called from its resemblance to a heart.\n\nCardiospermum.

As he was a valiant commander, he was no less a polite scholar; and wrote Pacata Hibernia, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the late wars in Ireland, printed after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, in 1633. He made several collections for a history of Henry V. which are digested into Speed's History of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. Besides these, he collected materials of Irish history in four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> MSS. volumes, now in the Bodleian library, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>.\n\nCarew, Thomas, descended from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of Carew in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLOUCESTERSHIRE\">Gloucestershire</a>, was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> of the privy chamber to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I. who always esteemed him one of the most celebrated wits of his court. He was much respected by the poets of his time, particularly by Ben Johnson and Sir William Davenant; and left behind him several poems, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASQUE\">masque</a> called Calum Britannicum, performed at Whitehall on Shrove Tuesday night, 1633, by the king, and several of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a> with their sons. Carew was assisted in the contrivance by Inigo Jones, and the music was set by Mr Henry Lawes of the king's chapel. He died in the prime of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, about the year 1639.\n\nCarew, Richard, author of the \"Survey of Cornwall,\" was the eldest son of Thomas Carew of East Anthony, and was born in 1555. When very young, he became a gentleman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONER\">commoner</a> of Christ-church college, Oxford; and at 14 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of disputing, extempore, with the afterwards famous Sir Phillip <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYDNEY\">Sydney</a>, in the presence of the earls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEICESTER\">Leicester</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARWICK\">Warwick</a>, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>. After spending three years at the university, he removed to the Middle Temple, where he resided the same length of time, and then travelled into foreign parts. Not long after his return to England, he married, in 1577, Juliana <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARUNDEL\">Arundel</a>, of Trecice. In 1581, Mr Carew was made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> of the peace, and in 1586 was appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of Cornwall; about which time he was likewise queen's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a>.\nIn 1589, he was elected a member of the college of Antiquaries, a distinction to which he was entitled by his literary abilities and pursuits. What particularly engaged his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> was his native county, his \"Survey\" of which was published, in 4to, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, in 1602. It hath been twice reprinted, first in 1723, and next in 1769. Of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> Camden hath spoken in high terms, and acknowledges his obligations to the author. In the present improved state of topographical knowledge, and since Dr Borlase's excellent publications relative to the county of Cornwall, the value of Carew's \"Survey\" must have been greatly diminished. Mr Gough remarks, that the history and monuments of this county were faintly touched by Carew; but it is added, that he was a person extremely capable of describing them, if the infancy of those studies at that time had afforded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and materials.\n\nAnother work of our author was a translation from the Italian, entitled, \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of Men's Wits.\" In which, by discovering the variety of natures, is showed for what profession each one is apt, and how far he shall profit therein.\" This was published at London in 1594, and afterwards in 1604; and though Richard Carew's name is prefixed to it, hath been principally ascribed by some persons to his father. According to Wood, Carew wrote also, \"The true and ready Way to learn the Latin Tongue,\" in answer to a query, whether the ordinary method of teaching the Latin by the rules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a> be the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of instructing youths in that language? This tract is involved in Mr Hartlib's book upon the same subject, and with the same title. It is certain that Carew was a gentleman of considerable abilities and literature, and that he was held in great estimation by some of the most eminent scholars of his time. He was particularly intimate with Sir Henry Spelman, who extols him for his ingenuity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, and learning.\n\nCarew, George, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> to the subject of the last article, was educated in the university of Oxford, after which he studied the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> in the inns of court, and then travelled to foreign countries for farther improvement. On his return to his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, he was called to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>, and after some time was appointed secretary to Sir Christopher Hatton, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> chancellor of England. This was by the special recommendation of Queen Elizabeth herself, who gave him a prothonotaryship in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHANCERY\">chancery</a>, and conferred upon him the honour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHTHOOD\">knighthood</a>. In 1597, Sir George Carew, who was then a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> in chancery, was sent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> to the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a>. In the next reign, he was one of the commissioners for treating with the Scotch concerning an union between the two kingdoms; after which he was appointed ambassador to the court of France, where he continued from the latter end of the year 1605 till 1609. During his residence in that country, he formed an intimacy with Thuanus, to whom he communicated an account of the transactions in Poland whilst he was employed there, which was of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to that admirable author in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> up the 121st book of his history. After Sir George Carew's return from France, he was advanced to the important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> of master of the court of wards, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> situation he did not long live to enjoy; for it appears from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> written by Thuanus to Camden in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> 1613, that he was then lately deceased. Sir George Carew married Thomasine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Sir Francis Godolphin, great grandfather of the lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a> Godolphin, and had by her two sons and three daughters. When Sir George Carew returned, in 1609, from his French embassy, he drew up, and addressed to James I., \"A Relation of the State of France, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of Henry IV. and the principal persons of that Court.\" The characters are drawn from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> knowledge and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> observation, and might be of service to a general historian of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> is perspicuous and manly, and entirely free from the pedantry which prevailed in the reign of James I. but this is the less surprising, as Sir George Carew's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> had been formed in a better era, that of Queen Elizabeth. The valuable tract we are speaking of lay for a long time in MS. till happily falling into the hands of the earl of Hardwicke, it was communicated by him to Dr Birch, who published it, in 1749, at the end of his \"Historical View of the Negotiations between the Courts of England, France, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSSELS\">Brussels</a>, from 1592 to 1617.\" That intelligent and industrious writer justly observes, that it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> upon which ambassadors may form and digest their motions and representations; and the late celebrated poet Mr Gray hath spoken of it as an excellent performance.","sp":189,"ep":192},{"h":"CARDS","t":"among gamesters, little pieces of fine thin pasteboard of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, of several sizes; but most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, three inches and a half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and two and a half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, on which are painted several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> and figures.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a> and blocks for making cards are exactly like those that were used for the first printed books. They lay a sheet of wet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> moist <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a>, which is very lightly done over with a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INK\">ink</a> made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> diluted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and mixed with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STARCH\">starch</a> to give it a body. They afterwards rub it off with a round lift. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>-cards are coloured by means of several patterns, styled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>-filers. These consist of papers cut through with a penknife; and in these apertures they apply severally the various colours, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, black, &c. These patterns are painted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>-colours, that the brushes may not wear them out; and when the pattern is laid on the pasteboard, they slightly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> over it a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, which, leaving it within the openings, forms the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> or figure of the card.\n\nAmong harpers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> sorts of false and fraudulent cards have been contrived; as, 1. Marked cards, where\nthe aces, kings, queens, knaves, are marked on the corners of the backs with spots of different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> and order, either with clear water or water tinged with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> ink, that those in the secret may distinguish them. Aces are marked with single spots on two corners opposite diagonally; kings with two spots at the same corners; knaves with the same number transferred. 2. Breef cards, those which are longer or broader than the rest; chiefly used at whist and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIQUET\">piquet</a>. The broad cards are usually for kings, queens, knaves, and aces; the long for the rest. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTINGS\">cuttings</a>, to enable him in the secret to cut the cards disadvantageously to his adversary, and draw the person unacquainted with the fraud to cut them favourably for the sharper. As the pack is placed either endwise or sidewise to him that is to cut, the long or broad cards naturally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> him to cut to them.

The inventor proposed, by the figures of the four suits or colours, as the French call them, to represent the four classes of men in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. By the coeurs (hearts) are meant the gens de chevau, choir-men, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a>; and therefore the Spaniards, who certainly received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of cards from the French, have copas, or chalices, instead of hearts. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, or prime <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the kingdom, are represented by the ends or points of lances or pikes; and our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the meaning or the resemblance of the figure induced us to call them spades: The Spaniards have espadas, swords, in lieu of pikes, which are of similar import. By diamonds are designed the order of citizens, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, or tradesmen, carreaux, (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, tiles, or the like): The Spaniards have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>, dineros, which answers to it; and the Dutch call the French word carreaux \"spreuken,\" stones and diamonds, from the form. Trefle, the trefoil-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>, or clover-grafs (corruptly called clubs), alludes to the husbandmen and peasants. But how this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> came to be called clubs is not easily explained; unless borrowing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAME\">game</a> from the Spaniards, who have bastos (staves or clubs) instead of the trefoil, we give the Spanish signification to the French figure.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the four kings, which the French, in drudery, sometimes call the cords, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>, Alexander, Caesar, and Charles; which names were then, and still are on the French cards. These respectable names represent the four celebrated monarchies of the Jews, Greeks, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, and Franks under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLEMAGNE\">Charlemagne</a>. By the queens are intended Argine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESTHER\">Esther</a>, Judith, and Pallas (names retained in the French cards), typical of birth, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, fortitude, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, the qualifications residing in each person. Argine is an anagram for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-REGINA\">regina</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>. By the knaves were designed the servants to knights (for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNAVE\">knave</a> originally meant only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a>); but French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a> and valets, now indiscriminately used by various orders of persons, were formerly only allowed to persons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, esquires (esquires), shield or armour bearers.

He published in 1720 a little collection of poems; and in 1732, five cantatas, written and composed by himself. He also composed sundry songs for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> comedies, particularly those in the \"Provoked Husband:\" he wrote a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARCE\">farce</a> called \"The Contrivances,\" in which were several little songs to very pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIRS\">airs</a> of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>: he also made two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> three little dramas for Goodman's-fields <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>, which were very favourably received. In 1729, he published by subscription his poems much enlarged: with the addition of one entitled \"Namby Pamby,\" in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBROSE\">Ambrose</a> Philips is ridiculed. Carey's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a>, says his historian, lay in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> and unamiable satire: to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> the rant and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOMBAST\">bombast</a> of modern tragedies he wrote one, to which he gave the strange <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of \"Chrononhotonthologos,\" acted in 1734. He also wrote a farce called \"The Honest Yorkshireman.\" Carey was a thorough Englishman, and had an unmountable aversion to the Italian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">opera</a> and the singers in it: he wrote a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURLESQUE\">burlesque</a> opera on the subject of the \"Dragon of Wantley;\" and afterwards a sequel to it, entitled, \"The Dragoness,\" both which were esteemed a true burlesque upon the Italian opera. His qualities being of the entertaining kind, he was led into more expenses than his finances could bear, and thus was frequently in distress. His friends, however, were always ready to assist him by their little subscriptions to his works: and encouraged by these, he republished, in 1740, all the songs he had ever composed, in a collection, entitled, \"The Musical Century, in 100 English Ballads, &c.\" and, in 1743, his dramatic works, in a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, 4to. With all his mirth and good humour, he seems to have been at times deeply affected with the malevolence of some of his own profession, who, for reasons that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> one can guess at, were\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARGADORS\">Cargadors</a> were his enemies; and this, with the pressure of his circumstances, is supposed to have occasioned his untimely end; for, about 1744, in a fit of desperation, he laid violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> on himself, and, at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> in Warner-street, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">Cold</a>-bath Fields, put an end to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, which, says Sir John Hawkins, had been led without reproach.

Those that lie nearest the east have been called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINDWARD\">Windward</a> Islands, the others the Leeward, on account of the winds blowing generally from the eastern point in those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the Caribbee islands, beginning from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOBAGO\">Tobago</a>, is nearly north and N. N. W. This direction is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, forming a line somewhat curved towards the north-west, and ending at Antigua. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> the line becomes at once curved; and extending itself in a straight direction to the west and north-west, meets in its course with Porto-Rico, St Domingo, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUBA\">Cuba</a>, known by the name of the Leeward Islands, which are separated from each other by channels of various breadths. Some of these are 6, others 15 or 20 leagues <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>; but in all of them the foundings are from 100 to 120 or 150 fathoms. Between Grenada and St Vincent's there is also a small archipelago of 30 leagues, in which the foundings are not above ten fathoms. The mountains in the Caribbee islands run in the same direction as the islands themselves. The direction is regular, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we were to consider the tops of these mountains only, independent of their bases, they might be looked upon as a chain of hills belonging to the continent, of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARTINICO\">Martinico</a> would be the most northerly promontory. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> of water which flow from the mountains in the Windward islands, run all in the western parts of these islands. The whole eastern coast is without any running water. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> springs come <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> there from the mountains: and indeed they would have been useless; for after having run over a very short tract of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, and with great rapidity, they would have fallen into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PORTO_RICO\">Porto Rico</a>, St Domingo, and Cuba, there are a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> that discharge themselves on the northern side, and whose sources rise in the mountains running from east to west, that is, through the whole length of these islands. From the other side of the mountains facing the south, where the sea, flowing with great impetuosity, leaves behind it marks of its inundations, several rivers flow down, the mouths of which are capable of receiving the largest ships. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> of the Caribbees consists mostly of a layer of clay or gravel of different thickness: under which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> or rock. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of some of these soils is better adapted to vegetables than others. In those places where the clay is drier and more friable, and mixes with the leaves and remains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, a layer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> is formed of greater depth than where the clay is moister. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> or gravel has different properties according to its peculiar nature; wherever it is less hard, less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a>, and less porous, small pieces separate themselves from it, which, though dry, preserve a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of coolness useful to vegetation. This soil is called in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> a pumice-stone soil. Whenever the clay and gravel do not go through such modifications, the soil becomes barren, as soon as the layer formed by the decomposition of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> plants is destroyed.\u2014By a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> concluded in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1660, between the French and English, the Caribs were confined to the islands of St Vincent's and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMINICA\">Dominica</a>, where all the scattered body of this people were united, and at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> did not exceed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> 6200 men. See St Vincent's and Dominica.\n\nAs the Caribbee islands are all between the tropics, their inhabitants are exposed, allowing for the varieties resulting from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of situation and soil, to a perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, which generally increases from the rising of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> till an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> after noon, and then declines in proportion as the sun declines. The variations of the temperature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> seem to depend rather on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> than on the changes of the seasons. In those places\nplaces where the wind does not blow, the air is excessively hot, and none but the easterly winds contribute to temper and refresh it; those that blow from the south and west afford little relief; but they are much less frequent and less regular than that which blows from the east. The branches of the trees exposed to the influence of the latter are forced round towards the west; but their roots are stronger, and more extended under the ground, towards the east than towards the west; and hence they are easily thrown down by strong west winds or hurricanes from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>. The easterly wind is scarce felt in the Caribbee islands before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> or ten o'clock in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, increases in proportion as the sun rises above the horizon, and decreases as it declines. Towards the evening it ceases entirely to blow on the coasts, but not on the open sea. It has also been observed, that it blows with more force and more regularity in the dog-days than at any other time of year.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> also contributes to the temperature of the Caribbee islands, though not equally in them all. In those places where the easterly wind meets with nothing to oppose its progress, it dispels the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> as they begin to rise, and causes them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> either in the woods or upon the mountains. But whenever the storms are too violent, or the blowing of the easterly wind is interrupted by the changeable and temporary effect of the southerly or westerly ones, it then begins to rain. In the other Caribbee islands, where this wind does not generally blow, the rains are so frequent and plentiful, especially in the winter season, which lasts from the middle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> to the middle of October, that, according to the most accurate observations, as much rain falls in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> as in our climates in a year. Instead of those mild refreshing showers which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> in the European climates, the rains of the Caribbee islands are torrents, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> of which might be mistaken for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a>, were not that almost totally unknown under so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> a sky. These showers indeed refresh the air; but they occasion a dampness, the effects of which are not less disagreeable than fatal. The dead must be interred within a few hours after they have expired. Meat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not keep sweet above 24 hours. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> decay, whether they are gathered ripe or before their maturity. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> must be made up into biscuits, to prevent its growing mouldy. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">Common</a> wines turn sour, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> turns rusty, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>'s time. The seeds can only be preserved by constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> and care, till the proper season returns for sowing them. When the Caribbee islands were first discovered, the corn that was conveyed there for the support of the Europeans, was soon damaged that it became necessary to send it out in the ears. This necessary precaution so much enhanced the price of it, that few were able to purchase it. Flour was then substituted in lieu of corn; which lowered indeed the expenses of transport, but had this inconvenience, that it was sooner damaged. It was imagined by a merchant, that if the flour were entirely separated from the bran, it would have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> advantage of being cheaper and keeping longer. He caused it therefore to be sifted, and put the finest flour into strong casks, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> together with iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMMERS\">hammers</a>, till it became so close a body that the air could scarcely penetrate it. This method was found to answer the purpose; and if, by it, the flour cannot be preserved as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as in our dry and temperate climates, it may be kept for six months, a year, or longer, according to the degree of care taken in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>.\n\nHowever troublesome these effects of the rain may be, it is attended with some others still more formidable; namely, frequent and dreadful earthquakes\u2014these happening generally during the time or towards the end of the rainy season, and when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> are highest, some ingenious naturalists have supposed that there might be a connexion between them. The waters of the sky and of the sea undermine, dig up, and ravage the earth in several different ways. Among the various shocks to which the Caribbee islands are exposed from the fury of the boisterous ocean, there is one distinguished by the name of raz de maree, or whirlpool. It constantly happens once, twice, or thrice, from July to October, and always on the western coasts, because it takes place after the time of the westerly or southerly winds, or while they blow. The waves, which at a distance seem to advance gently within 400 or 500 yards, suddenly swell against the shore, as if acted upon in an oblique direction by some superior force, and break with the greatest impetuosity.

In the 8th and 9th centuries, the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> was again ruined, and the city laid desolate by the incursions of the Norwegians and Danes.

It was fortified by Henry I. as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> against Scotland; he also placed a garrison in it, and made it an episcopal see. It was twice taken by the Scots, and afterwards burnt accidentally in the reign of Richard II. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a>, the suburbs, and 1300 houses were destroyed at that time. It is at present in a good condition; and has three gates, the English on the south, the Scotch on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, and the Irish on the west. It has two parishes, and as many churches, St Cuthbert's and St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>'s, the last of which is the cathedral, and is separated from the town by a wall of its own.

The greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Carlscrona stands upon a small rocky <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, which rises gently in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of the Baltic; the suburbs extend over another small rock, and along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOLE\">mole</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the basin where the fleet is moored.

The town is spacious, and contains about 18,000 inhabitants. It is adorned with one or two handsome churches, and a few tolerable houses of brick; but the generality of buildings are of wood. The suburbs are fortified towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> wall.

But new docks have been begun upon a stupendous plan, worthy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>. According to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> scheme, it was intended to construct 30 docks, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> and laying up the largest ships, at the extremity of the harbour. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> basin, capable of admitting two men of war, is designed to communicate, by sluices, with two smaller basins, from each of which are to extend, like the radii of a circle, five rows of covered docks: each row is to be separated by walls of stone; and each dock to be provided with sluice gates, so as to be filled or emptied by means of pumps. Close to the docks, magazines for naval stores, are to be constructed, and the whole to be enclosed with a stone wall. The project was begun in 1757; but was much neglected until the accession of his present majesty, who warmly patronized the arduous undertaking. At the commencement of the works, 25,000l. were annually expended upon them; which sum has been lessened to about 600l. per annum, and the number of docks reduced to 20.

It seems to have had the name of Carmel from its great fertility; this word, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> import, signifying the vine of God, and is used in Scripture to denote any fruitful spot, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> planted with fruit trees. This mountain, we are assured, was very fertile.

But what hath rendered Mount Carmel most celebrated and revered both by Jews and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, is its having been the residence of the prophet Elijah, who is supposed to have lived there in a cave (which is there shown), before he was taken up into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>.","sp":197,"ep":197},{"h":"CARMELITES","t":"an order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a>, making one of the four tribes of mendicants <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> begging friars; and taking its name from Mount Carmel, formerly inhabited by Elias, Elija, and the children of the prophets; from whom this order pretends to descend in an uninterrupted succession. The manner in which they make out their antiquity has something in it too ridiculous to be rehearsed. Some among them pretend they are descendants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ; others go further, and make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a> a Carmelite, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRUIDS\">druids</a> regular branches of their order. Phocas, a Greek monk, speaks the most reasonably.

In 1209, Albert, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, gave the solitaries a rigid rule, which Papebroch has since printed. In 1217, or, according to others, 1226, Pope Honorius III. approved and confirmed it. This rule contained 16 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>; one of which confined them to their cells, and enjoined them to continue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> and night in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a>; another prohibited the brethren having any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>; another enjoined fasting from the feast of the holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> till Easter, except on Sundays; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a> at all times from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> was enjoined by another article; one obliged them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> labour; another imposed a strict silence on them from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VESPERS\">vespers</a> till the third the next day.\n\nThe peace concluded by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Frederic II. with the Saracens, in the year 1229, so disadvantageous to Christendom, and so beneficial to the infidels, occasioned the Carmelites to quit the Holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">Land</a>, under Alan the fifth general of the order. He first sent some of the religious to Cyprus, who landed there in the year 1328, and founded a monastery in the forest of Fortania. Some Sicilians, at the same time, leaving Mount Carmel, returned to their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, where they founded a monastery in the suburbs of Messina. Some English departed out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, in the year 1240, to found others in England. Others of Provence, in the year 1244, founded a monastery in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> of Aigualates, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> from Marseille; and thus, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of their monasteries increasing, they held their European general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> in the year 1245, at their monastery of Aylesford in England.\u2014This order is so much increased, that it has, at present,\nprovinces, besides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANTUA\">Mantua</a>, in which are 54 monasteries, under a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VICAR\">vicar</a>-general; and the congregations of Barefooted Carmelites in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, which have their peculiar generals.\n\nAfter the establishment of the Carmelites in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, their rule was in some respects altered; the first time, by Pope Innocent IV. who added to the first article a precept of chastity, and relaxed the 11th which enjoins abstinence at all times from flesh, permitting them, when they travelled, to eat boiled flesh; this pope likewise gave them leave to eat in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> refectory, and to keep asses or mules for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. Their rule was again mitigated by the popes Eugenius IV. and Pius II. Hence the order is divided into two branches, viz. the Carmelites of the ancient observance, called the moderate, or mitigated; and those of the strict observance, who are the barefooted Carmelites; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> set on foot in 1549, by St. Theresa, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUN\">nun</a> of the convent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVILA\">Avila</a>, in Castile; these last are divided into two congregations, that of Spain and that of Italy.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of the Carmelites was at first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, and the cloak laced at the bottom with several huts.

He was so fond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, that he not only avoided all entertainments, but forgot even to eat at his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>; his maid-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> Melilla was obli-\nCarnades was put to put the victuals into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. He was an antagonist of the Stoics; and applied himself with great eagerness to refute the works of Chrysippus, one of the most celebrated philosophers of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. The power of his eloquence was dreaded even by a Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>. The Athenians being condemned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> to pay a fine of 500 talents for plundering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Oropus, sent ambassadors to Rome, who got the fine mitigated to 100 talents. Carnades the Academic, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOGENES\">Diogenes</a> the Stoic, and Critolaus the Peripatetic, were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with this embassy. Before they had an audience of the senate, they harangued to great multitudes in different parts of the city. Carnades's eloquence was distinguished from that of the others by its strength and rapidity. Cato the Elder made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> in the senate that these ambassadors should be immediately sent back, because it was very difficult to discern the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> through the arguments of Carnades. The Athenian ambassadors (said many of the senators) were sent rather to force us to comply with their demands, than to solicit them by persuasion; meaning, that it was impossible to resist the power of that eloquence with which Carnades addressed himself to them. According to Plutarch, the youth at Rome were so charmed by the orations of this philosopher, that they forsook their exercises and other diversions, and were carried with a kind of madness to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> of philosophizing spreading like enthusiasm. This grieved Cato, who was particularly afraid of the subtilty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> and strength of argument with which Carnades maintained either side of a question. Carnades harangued in favour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and the next day against it, to the admiration of all who heard him, among whom were Galba and Cato, the greatest orators of Rome.

Those who take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> side of the question, insist chiefly on the structure of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, which are mostly incisors <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> molars; not such as carnivorous animals are furnished with, and which are proper to tear flesh in pieces: to which it may be added, that, even when we do feed on flesh, it is not without a preparatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a>, roasting, &c. and even then that it is the hardest of digestion of all foods. To these arguments Dr Wallis subjoins another, which is, that all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a> which feed on herbs or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> colon, with a c\u00e6cum at the upper end of it, or somewhat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a>, which conveys the food by a long and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> progress, from the stomach downwards, in order to its slower passage and longer stay in the intestines: but that, in carnivorous animals, such c\u00e6cum is wanting, and instead thereof there is a more short and slender gut, and a quicker passage through the intestines. Now, in man, the c\u00e6cum is very visible: a strong presumption that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, who is still consistent with herself, did not intend him for a carnivorous animal.\u2014It is true, the c\u00e6cum is but small in adults, and seems of little or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>; but in a fetus it is much larger in proportion: And it is probable, our customary change of diet, as we grow up, may occasion this shrinking. But to these arguments Dr Tyton replies, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> man had been by nature designed not to be carnivorous, there would doubtless have been found, somewhere on the globe, people who do not feed on flesh; which is not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. Neither are carnivorous animals always without a colon and c\u00e6cum; nor are all animals carnivorous which have these parts: the opossum for instance, hath both a colon and c\u00e6cum, and yet feeds on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a> and other flesh; whereas the hedgehog, which has neither colon nor c\u00e6cum, and so ought to be carnivorous, feeds only on vegetables. Add to this, that hogs which have both, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> feed upon flesh when they can get it; and rats and mice, which have large c\u00e6cums, will feed on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">bacon</a> as well as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> and cheese. Lastly, The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> are furnished with teeth necessary for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of all kinds of foods; from whence it would seem, that nature intended we should live on all. And as the alimentary duct in the human body is fitted for digesting all kinds of foods, ought we not rather to conclude, that nature did not intend to deny us any?\n\nIt is no less disputed whether mankind were carnivorous before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is generally serene and clear the greatest part of the year; but in February and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> the inhabitants have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> the woods, which causes such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>, as to strangers would seem to proceed from a fog <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> thickens in the air. The smoke of the tar-kilns likewise deceives strangers, and gives them an ill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of the air of Carolina; to which also conduces a custom of the Indians of setting fire to the woods in their huntings, for many miles round. The great rains are in winter, though they are not without heavy showers at midsummer; add to these the constant dews that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> in the night, which refresh the ground and supply the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> with moisture. In North Carolina, the northwest winds in the winter occasion very pinching <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>; but they are not of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> continuance. Westerly winds bring very pleasant weather; but the southerly are hot and unwholesome, occasioning fevers and other disorders. But this must be understood of summer, for in winter they are very comfortable. The depth of winter is towards the latter end of February, and then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> is not strong enough to bear a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>. In August and September there are sometimes great storms and squalls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, which are so violent as to make lanes of 100 feet wide, more or less, through the woods, tearing up the trees by the roots. These storms generally happen once in about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years; and are attended with dreadful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>, and heavy rains. They <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> happen about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the hurricanes which rage so fatally among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> between the tropics; and seem to be occasioned by them, or to proceed from the same cause; but by the time they reach Carolina, their force is much abated; and the farther north they proceed, so much the more do they decrease in fury. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a>; but farther up, the country is so fruitful that they have not yet been at the trouble to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>. The grains most cultivated are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> corn and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>, though any sort <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> thrive well enough; they have also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> of several sorts, little known in England. All kinds of garden stuff usual in England are cultivated here, and may be had in great plenty. They export <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> quantities yearly of rice, pitch, tar, turpentine, deer-skins, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>; cypresses, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEDAR\">cedar</a>, sassafras, oak, walnut, and pine.

It hath been attempted in vain to cultivate vines, and produce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, in this country; for though the frosts here do not continue long without intervals of warmer weather, they are sufficient to check the growth of the vine, as well as olives, dates, oranges, &c. The furs are bought of the Indians with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMILION\">vermilion</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, coarse cloth, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, and spirituous liquors. As yet they have not a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of handicraftsmen; which renders labour very dear, and a supply of clothes from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> necessary. The aspect of the country is very fine, being adorned with beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> and creeks, and the woods with lofty timber, which afford delightful and pleasant seats for the planters, and render the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FENCING\">fencing</a> their lands very easy. And as they have plenty of fish, wild-fowl, and venison, besides other necessaries which this country produces naturally, they live easy and luxuriously.\n\nTheir rivers are large, and navigable a great many miles upon the country. They rise near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, and abound with delicate fish, besides <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>-fowl of different kinds. In some there are islands which yield good pasture, without the annoyance of wild beasts. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> mountains are the Cherokee or Allegany mountains, which are situated north and northwest, five or six hundred miles distant from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. They are very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>; and abound with trees, plants, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, and minerals, of different kinds.\n\nThis country is divided into North and South Carolina, and Georgia; each of which, before the late revolution, was under a particular governor. The North is subdivided into four counties, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANVILLE\">Granville</a>, Colliton, Berkley, and Craven; and South Carolina into two, Clarendon and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBEMARLE\">Albemarle</a>. This last is also divided into 14 parishes or townships, each of which has a brick or timber <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>. The former likewise has the same number of parishes. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLESTOWN\">Charlestown</a> is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of the whole country.\n\nCarolina was discovered by Sebastian Cabot about the year 1520, in the reign of Henry VII., but the settling of it being neglected by the English, a colony of French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a>, by the encouragement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMIRAL\">Admiral</a> Coligni, were transported thither; and named the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of their first settlement Arc Carolina, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> IX., of France; but in\na short time that colony was destroyed by the Spaniards; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other attempt was made by any European power to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> there till the year 1664, when 800 English landed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> Fear in North Carolina, and took possession of the country. In 1670 Cha. II. of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> granted Carolina to the lords Berkeley, Clarendon, Albemarle, Craven, and Ashly, Sir George Carteret, Sir William Berkeley, and Sir John Colliton. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> for this new colony was drawn up by the famous Mr Locke, who very wisely proposed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> toleration in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> matters. The only restriction in this respect was, that every person claiming the protection of that settlement, should, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 17, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> himself in some particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a>. To civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, however, our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> was not so favourable; the code of Carolina gave to the eight proprietors who founded the colony, and to their heirs, not only all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of a monarch, but all the powers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, which was composed of this sovereign body, and called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALATINATE\">Palatinate</a> Court, was invested with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of nominating to all employments and dignities, and even of conferring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>; but with new and unprecedented titles. They were, for instance, to create in each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> two caciques, each of whom was to be possessed of 24,000 acres of land; and a landgrave, who was to have 80,000. The persons on whom these honours should be bestowed were to compose the upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, and their possessions were made unalienable. They had only the right of farming or letting out a third part of them at the most for three lives. The lower house was composed of the deputies from the several counties and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>. The number of this representative body was to be increased as the colony grew more populous. No tenant was to pay more than about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a> per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>, and even this rent was redeemable. All the inhabitants, however, both slaves and freemen, were under an obligation to take up arms upon the first order from the Palatine court.\n\nIt was not long before the defects of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>. The proprietary lords used every endeavour to establish an arbitrary government; and, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the colonists exerted themselves with great zeal to avoid servitude. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this struggle, the whole province, distracted with tumults and dissensions, became incapable of making any progress, though great things had been expected from its particular advantages of situation. Though a toleration in religious matters was a part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> constitution, dissensions arose likewise on that account. In 1705, Carteret, now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Granville, who, as the oldest of the proprietors, was sole governor of the colony, formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of obliging all the non-conformists to embrace the ceremonies of the Church of England; and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of violence, though disapproved and rejected by the mother-country, inflamed the minds of the people. In 1720, while this animosity was still subsisting, the province was attacked by several bands of savages, driven to despair by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> course of the most atrocious violence and injustice. These unfortunate wretches were all put to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>; but, in 1728, the lords proprietors having refused to contribute towards the expenses of an expedition, of which they were to share the immediate benefits, were deprived of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a>, except Lord Granville, who still retained his eighth part. The rest received a recompense of about 24,000l. The colony was taken under the immediate protection of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, and from that time began to flourish. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> into North and South Carolina now took place, and the settlement of Georgia commenced in 1732. See GEORGIA.\n\nCAROLINE.

It is very quick in its growth, and brings forth the spawn three times a-year, so that the increase is very great.

The best judges allow, that, in stocking a breeding-pond, four males should be allowed to twelve females. The usual growth of a carp is two or three inches in length in a year; but, in ponds which receive the fattening of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> feeders, they have been known to grow from five inches to 18 in one year.

Grains, blood, chicken-guts, and the like, may at times\nCARPATES times be thrown into carp-ponds, to help to fatten the fish. To make them grow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and fat, the growth of grass under the water should by all means possible be encouraged. For this purpose, as the water decreases in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, the sides of the pond left naked and dry should be well raked with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RAKE\">rake</a>, to destroy all the weeds, and cut up the surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; hay-feed should then be sown plentifully in these places; and more ground prepared in the same manner, as the water falls more and more away. By this means there will be a fine and plentiful growth of young grass along the sides of the pond to the water's edge; and when the rains fill up the pond again, this will be all buried under the water, and will make a feeding-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> for the fish where they will come early in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, and will fatten greatly upon what they find there.","sp":202,"ep":203},{"h":"CARPATHUS","t":"an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, two hundred stadia in compass, and an hundred in length.

See Columba.\n\nThough you carry these birds hood-winked, 20, 30, nay, 60 or 100 miles, they will find their way in a very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to the place where they were bred. They are trained to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>: and are carried first, while young, short flights of half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>, afterwards more, till at length they will return from the farthest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. Every bailiwick has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASKET\">basket</a> of these pigeons bred in the feraglio, which, upon any emergent occasion, as in insurrection, or the like, he dispatches, with letters braced under their wings, to the feraglio; which proves a more speedy method, as well as a more safe one, than any other; he sends out more than one pigeon, however, for fear of accidents. Lithgow assures us, that one of these birds will carry a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLON\">Babylon</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEPPO\">Aleppo</a>, which is 30 days journey, in 48 hours. This is also a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> practice: Hirtius and Brutus, at the siege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODENA\">Modena</a>, held a correspondence with one another by means of pigeons. And Ovid tells us, that Taurophenes, by a pigeon stained with purple, gave notice to his father of his victory at the Olympic Games, sending it to him at Aegina.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times, the most noted were the pigeons of Aleppo, which served as couriers at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALEXANDRETTA\">Alexandretta</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAGDAD\">Bagdad</a>. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of them has been laid aside for the last 30 or 40 years, because the Kurd robbers kill...\ned the pigeons. The manner of sending advice by them was this: they took pairs which had young ones, and carried them on horseback to the place from whence they wished them to return, taking care to let them have a full view. When the news arrived, the correspondent tied a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILLET\">billet</a> to the pigeon's foot, and let her loose. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a>, impatient to see its young, flew off like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>, and arrived at Aleppo in ten hours from Alexandretta, and in two days from Bagdad. It was not difficult for them to find their way back, since Aleppo may be discovered at an immense distance. This pigeon has nothing peculiar in its form, except its nostrils, which, instead of being smooth and even, are swelled and rough.","sp":205,"ep":206},{"h":"CARRON","t":"a small but remarkable river in Scotland, rising about the middle of the isthmus between the firths of Forth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLYDE\">Clyde</a>. Both its source, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where it empties itself into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, are within the shire of Stirling, which it divides into two nearly equal parts. The whole length of its course, which is from west to east, is not above 14 miles. It falls into the firth of Forth about three miles to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-east of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALKIRK\">Falkirk</a>. The stream thereof is but small, and scarce deserves the notice of a traveller; yet there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> river in Scotland, and few in the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, whose banks have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of so many memorable transactions. When the Roman empire was in all its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, and had its eastern frontiers upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUPHRATES\">Euphrates</a>, the banks of Carron were its boundaries upon the north-west; for the wall of Antoninus*, which was raised to mark the limits of that mighty empire, stood in the neighbourhood of this river, and ran <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to it for several miles.\n\nNear the middle of its course, in a pleasant valley, stand two beautiful mounts, called the Hills of Dunipace, which are taken notice of by most of the Scottish historians as monuments of great antiquity. The whole structure of these mounts is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; but they are not both of the same form and dimensions. The more easterly one is perfectly round, resembling an oven, and about fifty feet in height: And that this is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> does not admit of the least doubt; but we cannot affirm the same, with equal certainty, of the other, though it has been generally supposed to be so too. It bears no resemblance to the eastern one either in shape <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> size. At the foundation it is nearly of a triangular form; but the superstructure is quite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>; nor does the height thereof bear any proportion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of its base. These mounts are now planted with firs, which, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Dunipace standing in the middle between them, and the river running hard by, give this valley a very romantic appearance. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> account given of these mounts is, that they were erected as monuments of a peace concluded in that place between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> and the Caledonians, and that their name partakes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of both people; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUN\">Dun</a> signifying a hill in the old language of this island, and Pax \"peace\" in the language of Rome. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> word, Dunipace, signifies \"the hills of peace.\" And we find in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, that no less than three treaties of peace were at different periods entered into between the Romans and Caledonians; the first by Severus about the year 210; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> soon after, by his son <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARACALLA\">Caracalla</a>; and the third, by the usurper Carausius, Carron, about the year 280; but of which of these treaties Dunipace is a monument, we do not pretend to determine. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the concurring testimony of historians and antiquaries did not agree in giving this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> to these mounts, we would be tempted to conjecture that they are sepulchral monuments. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">Human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> and urns have been discovered in earthen fabrics of this kind in many parts of this island, and the little mounts or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARROWS\">barrows</a> which are scattered in great numbers about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONEHENGE\">Stonehenge</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALISBURY\">Salisbury</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> are generally supposed to have been the sepulchres of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Britons. See BARROWS.\n\nFrom the valley of Dunipace, the river runs for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> in a deep and hollow channel, with steep banks on both sides; here it passes by the foundations of the ancient Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>; not far from which, as is generally thought, was the scene of the memorable conference betwixt the Scotch patriot William Wallace and Robert Bruce, father to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of that name, which first opened the eyes of the latter to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> view, both of his own true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> and that of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>.\n\nAfter the river has left the village and bridge of Larbert, it soon comes up to another small valley, through the midst of which it has now worn out to itself a straight channel, whereas, in former ages, it had taken a considerable compass, as appears by the track of the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> which is still visible. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> and circling banks upon the south side give to this valley the appearance of a spacious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>; and, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> of the country, there was once an harbour here: nor does the tradition seem altogether groundless, pieces of broken anchors having been found here, and some of them within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of people yet alive. The stream <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> would still flow near the place, if they were not kept back by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAM\">dam</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> built across the river at Stenhoule; and there is reason to believe, that the stream flowed considerably higher in former ages than it does at present. In the near neighbourhood of this valley, upon the south, stand the ruins of ancient Camelon: which, after it was abandoned by the Romans, was probably inhabited, for some ages, by the natives of the country.\n\nAnother ancient monument, called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARTHUR\">Arthur</a>'s Oven, once stood upon the banks of the Carron; but was, with a spirit truly Gothic, entirely demolished about 40 years ago. The corner of a small inclosure between Stenhoule and the Carron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>-works, is pointed out as the place of its situation. This is generally supposed to have been a Roman work; though it is not easy to conceive what could be their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> for erecting such a fabric, at so great a distance from any other of their works, and in a spot which at that time must have been very remote and unfrequented. The form of it is said to have been perfectly round, and rising perpendicular for some yards at first, but afterwards gradually contracted, till it terminated in a narrow orifice at the top. Antiquaries are not agreed whether it had been a temple, or a trophy, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAUSOLEUM\">mausoleum</a>; but the most common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> is, that it had been a temple, and Buchanan thinks, a temple of Terminus. Hector Boetius says, that there were benches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> all around it upon the inside; and that there had been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> stone\nAs the Carron extends over the half of the isthmus, and runs so near the ancient boundaries of the Roman empire, the adjacent country fell naturally to be the scene of many battles and encounters. Historians mention a bloody <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> fought near the river between the Romans and the confederate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of the Scots and Picts in the beginning of the 5th century.\n\nThe scenes of some of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OSSIAN\">Ossian</a>'s poems were, in the opinion of the translator, upon the banks of this river. Here Fingal fought with Caracal, the son of the king of the world, supposed to have been the same with Caracalla, the son of the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Severus. Here also young Oscar, the son of Ossian, performed some of his heroic exploits. Hereabout was the stream of Crona, celebrated in the ancient compositions of the Gaelic bard; possibly that now called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> of Bonny, which runs in the neighbourhood of the Roman wall, and discharges itself into the Carron at Dunipace. In those poems, mention is made of a green vale upon the banks of this river, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a> standing in the middle of it, where young Oscar's party and the warriors of Caros met. We only take notice of this as it strengthens the conjecture hazarded above, that the mounts of Dunipace, especially the more easterly of them, were sepulchral monuments.\u2014About the distance of half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> from the river, and near the town of Falkirk, lies the field of that battle which was fought by William Wallace and the English in the beginning of the 14th century. It goes by the name of Graham's muir, from the valiant John Graham, who fell there, and whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>-stone is still to be seen in the church-yard of Falkirk.\n\nThe river Carron, though it has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> since ceased to roll its stream amidst the din of arms, still preserves its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, by lending its aid to trade and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> (see the next article).\u2014The river is navigable for some miles near its mouth, and a considerable trade is carried on upon it by small craft; for the convenience of which, its channel has of late years been straightened and much shortened, and the great Canal has its entrance from it.\n\nCarron-Works, a large iron-foundery, two miles north from Falkirk in Scotland. They are conveniently situated on the banks of the Carron, three miles above its entry into the frith of Forth. Above 100 acres of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> have been converted into reservoirs and pools, for water diverted from the river, by magnificent dams built above two miles above the works, which, after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> 18 large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> for the several purposes of the manufacture, falls into a tide-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> that conveys their castings to the sea.\n\nThese works are the greatest of the kind in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, and were established in 1760. At present, the buildings are of vast extent; and the machinery, constructed by Mr Smeaton, is the first in Britain, both in elegance and correctness: there are 1600 men employed, to whom is paid weekly above \u00a3600 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>; which has greatly enriched the adjoining country; 650 tons of iron are smelted annually from the mineral with pit-coal, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> into cannon, cylinders, &c.\u2014In the founding of cannon, these works have lately arrived at such perfection, that they make above 5000 pieces a-year, many of which are exported to foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>; and their guns of new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> are the lightest and neatest now in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, not excepting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> guns; the 32 pounder ship-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUN\">gun</a> weighing 42 hundred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, the 6 pounder 8 hundred-weight and one-half, and the other calibers in proportion.\n\nThe present proprietors are a chartered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of \u00a3150,000 sterling, a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>, &c., but their stock is confined to a very few individuals.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRONADE\">Carronade</a>, a short kind of ordnance, capable of carrying a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>, and useful in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> engagements at sea.

The word comes from the Latin carrus, or British carr, which is still the Irish name for any wheel-carriage.\n\nCarruca, or Caruca, is also used in middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> writers for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>.\n\nCarruca, or Caruca, also was sometimes used for carrucata.

On his return to Scotland to procure a licence to teach doctrines which he had studied with the greatest care, he became disgusted with the proud and insolent conduct of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">Archbishop</a> Sharp, and prepared to revisit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>; where he knew that religious liberty was respected, and where he hoped he might better his condition by the connections he had formed.\n\nHis expectations were not vain.

In the 7th year of Pygmalion <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRE\">Tyre</a>, his sister Elissa, or Dido, is said to have fled, with some of her Dido, companions and vassals, from the cruelty and avarice of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, who had put to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> her husband Sirachus in order to get possession of his wealth.\n\nShe first touched at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Cyprus, where she met with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>, who was desirous of attending her; to which she readily consented, and fixed the priesthood in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>. At that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> it was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> in the island of Cyprus, for the young women to go on certain stated days, before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> side, there to look for strangers, that might possibly arrive on their coasts, in order to prostitute themselves for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a>, that they might thereby acquire a dowry. Out of these the Tyrians selected 80, whom they carried along with them. From Cyprus they sailed directly for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Africa; and at last safely landed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> called Africa Propria, not far from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UTICA\">Utica</a>, a Phoenician city of great antiquity. The inhabitants received their countrymen with great demonstrations of joy, and invited them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> among them. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> is, that the Phoenicians imposed upon the Africans in the following manner: They desired, for their intended settlement, only as much ground as an ox's hide would encompass. This request the Africans laughed at; but were surprised, when, upon their granting it, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> Elissa cut the hide into the smallest threads, by which means it surrounded a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> territory; in which she built the citadel called Lyra. The learned, however, are now unanimous in exploding this fable; and it is certain that the Carthaginians for many years paid an annual tribute to the Africans for the ground they possessed.\n\nThe new city soon became populous and flourishing,\nCarthage by the accession of the neighbouring Africans, who came thither at first with a view of traffic. In a short time it became so considerable, that Jarbas, a neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, thought of making himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of it without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of blood. In order to this, he desired that an embassy of ten of the most noble Carthaginians might be sent him; and, upon their arrival, proposed to them a marriage with Dido, threatening <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of a refusal. The ambassadors, being afraid to deliver this message, told the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> that Jarbas desired some person might be sent him who was capable of civilizing his Africans; but that there was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> possibility of finding any of her subjects who would leave his relations for the conversion of such barbarians. For this they were reprimanded by the queen; who told them that they ought to be ashamed of refusing to live in any manner for the benefit of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. Upon this, they informed her of the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of their message from Jarbas; and that, according to her own decision, she ought to sacrifice herself for the good of her country. The unhappy queen, rather than submit to be the wife of such a barbarian, caused a funeral pile to be erected, and put an end to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> with a dagger.\n\nThis is Justin's account of the death of Queen Dido, and is the most probable; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>'s story of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMOUR\">amour</a> with \u00c6neas being looked upon as fabulous, even in the days of Macrobius, as we are informed by that historian. How <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> monarchical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in Carthage, or what happened to this state in its infancy, we are altogether ignorant, by reason of the Punic archives being destroyed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>; so that there is a chain in the Carthaginian history for above 300 years. It, however, appears, that from the very beginning, the Carthaginians applied themselves to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> affairs, and were formidable by sea in the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYRUS\">Cyrus</a> and Cambyses. From Diodorus Siculus and Justin, it appears that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> support of the Carthaginians were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, in which country they seem to have established themselves very early. By means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> drawn from these mines, they were enabled to equip such formidable fleets as we are told they fitted out in the time of Cyrus or Cambyses. Justin intimates, that the first Carthaginian settlement in Spain happened when the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GADES\">Gades</a>, now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CADIZ\">Cadiz</a>, was but of late standing, or even in its infancy. The Spaniards finding this new colony begin to flourish, attacked it with a numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, infomuch that the inhabitants were obliged to call in the Carthaginians to their aid. The latter very readily granted their request, and not only repulsed the Spaniards, but made themselves masters of almost the whole province in which their new city stood. By this success, they were encouraged to attempt the conquest of the whole country; but having to do with very warlike nations, they could not push their conquests to any great length at first; and it appears from the accounts of Livy and Polybius, that the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Spain remained unsubdued till the time of Hamilcar, AIdrubar, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANNIBAL\">Hannibal</a>.\n\nAbout 503 years before the birth of Christ, the Carthaginians entered into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> with the Romans. It related chiefly to matters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>. From it we learn, that the whole island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDINIA\">Sardinia</a>, and part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, were then subject to Carthage; that they were very well acquainted with Carthage, the coasts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, and had made some attempts upon them before this time: and that, even at this early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, a spirit of jealousy had taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> between the two republics. Some time near this period, the Carthaginians had a mind to discontinue the tribute they had hitherto paid the Africans for the ground on which their city stood. But, notwithstanding all their power, they were at present unsuccessful; and at last were obliged to conclude a peace, one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of which was, that the tribute should be continued.\n\nBy degrees the Carthaginians extended their power over all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>, Sicily excepted; and for the entire conquest of this, they made vast preparations, about 480 years before Christ. Their army consisted of 300,000 men; their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> was composed of upwards of 2000 men of war, and 3000 transports; and with such an immense armament, they made no doubt of conquering the whole island in a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a>. In this, however, they found themselves miserably deceived. Hamilcar their general having landed his numerous forces, invested Himera, a city of considerable importance. He carried on his attacks with the greatest avidity; but was at last attacked in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENCHES\">trenches</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GELON\">Gelon</a> and Theron, the tyrants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRIGENTUM\">Agrigentum</a>, who gave the Carthaginians one of the greatest overthrow mentioned in history. An hundred and fifty thousand were killed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> and pursuit, and all the rest taken prisoners; so that of so mighty an army not a single person escaped. Of the 2000 ships of war and 3000 transports, of which the Carthaginian fleet consisted, eight ships only, which then happened to be out at sea, made their escape: these immediately set sail for Carthage; but were all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> away, and every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> perished, except a few who were saved in a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>, and at last reached Carthage with the dismal news of the total loss of the fleet and army. No words can express the consternation of the Carthaginians upon receiving the news of so terrible a disaster. Ambassadors were immediately dispatched to Sicily, with orders to conclude a peace upon any terms. They put to sea without delay; and landing at Syracuse, threw themselves at the conqueror's feet. They begged Gelon, with many tears, to receive their city into favour, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> them a peace on whatever terms he should choose to prefer. He granted their request, upon condition that Carthage should pay him 2000 talents of silver to defray the expenses of the war; that they should build two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>, where the articles of the treaty should be lodged and kept as sacred; and that for the future they should abstain from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> sacrifices. This was not thought a dear purchase of a peace for which there was such occasion; and to show their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> for Gelon's moderation, the Carthaginians complimented his wife Demarata with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> worth 100 talents.\n\nFrom this time we find little mention of the Carthaginians for 70 years. Some time during this period, however, they had greatly extended their dominions in Africa, and likewise shaken off the tribute which gave them so much uneasiness. They had disputes with the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYRENE\">Cyrene</a> the capital of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYRENAICA\">Cyrenaica</a>, about a regulation of the limits of\nCarthage of their respective territories. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of these disputes was a war, which reduced both nations so low, that they agreed first to a cessation of arms, and then to a peace. At last it was agreed, that each state should appoint two commissioners, who should set out from their respective cities on the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and that the spot on which they met should be the boundary of both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>. In consequence of this, two brothers called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILENI\">Phileni</a> were sent out from Carthage, who advanced with great celerity, while those from Cyrene were much more slow in their motions. Whether this proceeded from accident or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERJURY\">perjury</a>, we are not certainly informed; but, be this as it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, the Cyreneans finding themselves greatly outstripped by the Phileni, accused them of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, alleging that they had set out before the time appointed, and consequently that the convention between their principals was broken. The Phileni desired them to propose some expedient whereby their differences might be accommodated; promising to submit to it whatever it might be. The Cyreneans then proposed, either that the Phileni should retire from the place where they were, or that they should be buried alive upon the spot. With this last condition the brothers immediately complied, and by their death gained a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of territory to the country. The Carthaginians ever after celebrated this as a most brave and heroic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>; paid them divine honours; and endeavoured to immortalize their names by erecting two altars there, with suitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSCRIPTIONS\">inscriptions</a> upon them.\n\nAbout the year before Christ 412, some disputes happening between the Egeines and Selinis, inhabitants of two cities in Sicily, the former called in the Carthaginians to their assistance; and this occasioned a new invasion of Sicily by that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>. Great preparations were made for this war; Hannibal, whom they had appointed general, was empowered to raise an army equal to the undertaking, and equip a suitable fleet. They also appointed certain funds for defraying all the expenses of the war, intending to exert their whole force to reduce the island under their subjection.\n\nThe Carthaginian general having landed his forces, immediately marched for Selinis. In his way he took Emporium, a town situated on the river Mazara; and having arrived at Selinis, he immediately invested it. The besieged made a very vigorous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>; but at last the city was taken by storm, and the inhabitants were treated with the utmost cruelty. All were massacred by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> conqueror, except the women who fled to the temples; and these escaped, not through the merciful disposition of the Carthaginians, but because they were afraid, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> driven to despair they would set fire to the temples, and by that means consume the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> they expected to find in those places. Sixteen thousand were massacred; 2,250 escaped to Agrigentum; and the women and children, about 5,000 in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, were carried away captives. At the same time the temples were plundered, and the city razed to the ground.\n\nAfter the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of Selinis, Hannibal laid siege to Himera; that city he desired above all things to become master of, that he might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> the death of his grandfather Hamilcar, who had been slain before it by Gelon. His troops, flushed with their late success, behaved with undaunted courage; but finding his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTERING\">battering</a> engines not to answer his purpose sufficiently, he undermined the wall, supporting it with large beams of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>, to which he afterwards set fire, and thus laid part of it flat on the ground. Notwithstanding this advantage, however, the Carthaginians were several times repulsed with great slaughter; but at last they became masters of the place, and treated it in the same manner as they had done Selinis. After this, Hannibal, dismissing his Sicilian and Italian allies, returned to Africa.\n\nThe Carthaginians were now so much elated, that they meditated the reduction of the whole island. But as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> and infirmities of Hannibal rendered him incapable of commanding the forces alone, they joined in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> with him Imilcar, the son of Hanno, one of the same family. On the landing of the Carthaginian army, all Sicily was alarmed, and the principal cities put themselves into the best state of defence they were able. The Carthaginians immediately marched to Agrigentum, and began to batter the walls with great fury. The besieged, however, defended the siege; themselves with incredible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> burnt all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> raised against their city, and repulsed the enemy with great slaughter. The Syracusans, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, being alarmed at the danger of Agrigentum, sent an army to its relief. On their approach they were immediately attacked by the Carthaginians; but after a sharp dispute the latter were defeated, and forced to fly to the very walls of Agrigentum, with the loss of 6,000 men. Had the Agrigentine commanders now fallen out, and fallen upon the fugitives, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> the Carthaginian army must have been destroyed; but either through fear or corruption, they refused to stir out of the place, and this occasioned the loss of it. Immense booty was found in the city; and the Carthaginians behaved with their usual cruelty, putting all the inhabitants to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, not excepting even those who had fled to the temples.\n\nThe next attempt of the Carthaginians was designed against the city of Gela; but the Geleans, being greatly alarmed, implored the protection of Syracuse; and, at their request, Dionysius was sent to assist them with 2,000 foot and 400 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>. The Geleans were so well satisfied with his conduct, that they treated him with the highest marks of distinction; they even sent ambassadors to Syracuse to return thanks for the important services done them by sending him thither; and soon after he was appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERALISSIMO\">generalissimo</a> of the Syracusan forces and those of their allies against the Carthaginians. In the mean time Imilcar, having razed the city of Agrigentum, made an incursion into the territories of Gela and Comarina; which having ravaged in a dreadful manner, he carried off such immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of plunder, as filled his whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>. He then marched against the city; but though Gela was but indifferently fortified, he met with a very vigorous resistance; and the place held out for a long time without receiving any assistance from its allies.\n\nAt last Dionysius came to its assistance with an army of 50,000 foot and 1,000 horse. With these he attacked the Carthaginian camp, but was repulsed with great loss; after which, he called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of war, the result of whose deliberations was, that since the enemy was\nCarthage was so much superior to them in strength, it would be highly imprudent to put all to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> of a battle; and therefore, that the inhabitants should be persuaded to abandon the country, as the only means of saving their lives. In consequence of this, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRUMPET\">trumpet</a> was sent to Imilcar to define a cessation of arms till the next day, in order, as was pretended, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> the dead, but in reality to give the people of Gela an opportunity of making their escape. Towards the beginning of the night the bulk of the citizens left the place; and he himself with the army followed them about midnight. To amuse the enemy, he left 2000 of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>-armed troops behind him, commanding them to make fires all night, and set up loud shouts as though the army still remained in town. At day-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> these took the same route as their companions, and pursued their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> with great celerity. The Carthaginians, finding the city deserted by the greatest part of its inhabitants, immediately entered it, putting to death all who had remained; after which, Imilcar having thoroughly plundered it, moved towards Camarina. The inhabitants of this city had been likewise drawn off by Dionysius, and it underwent the same fate with Gela.\n\nNotwithstanding these successes, however, Imilcar finding his army greatly weakened, partly by the casualties of war, and partly by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> which broke out in it, sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HERALD\">herald</a> to Syracuse to offer terms of peace. His unexpected arrival was very agreeable to the Syracusans, and a peace was immediately concluded upon the following terms, viz. That the Carthaginians, besides their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> acquisitions in Sicily, should still possess the countries of the Silcianai, the Selinuntines, the Himereans, and Argentines; that the people of Gela and Camarina should be permitted to reside in their respective cities, which yet should be dismantled, upon their paying an annual tribute to the Carthaginians; and that all the other Sicilians should prefer their independency except the Syracusans, who should continue in subjection to Dionysius.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a> of Syracuse, however, had concluded this peace with no other view than to gain time, and to put himself in a condition to attack the Carthaginian territories with greater force. Having accomplished this, he acquainted the Syracusans with his design, and they immediately approved of it; upon which he gave up to the fury of the populace the persons and possessions of the Carthaginians who resided in Syracuse, and traded there on the faith of treaties. As there were many of their ships at that time in the harbour, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with cargoes of great value, the people immediately plundered them; and, not content with this, ransacked all their houses in a most outrageous manner. This example was followed throughout the whole island; and in the mean time Dionysius dispatched a herald to Carthage, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> and people, telling them, that if they did not immediately withdraw their garrisons from all the Greek cities in Sicily, the people of Syracuse would treat them as enemies. With this demand, however, he did not allow them to comply; for without waiting for any answer from Carthage, he advanced with his army to Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERYX\">Eryx</a>, near which stood the city of Motya, a Carthaginian colony of great importance; and this he immediately invested. But soon after, leaving his brother Leptines to carry on the attacks, he himself went with the greatest part of his forces to reduce the cities in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with the Carthaginians. He destroyed their territories with fire and sword, cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> all their trees; and then he sat down before Egagla and Entella, most of the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> having opened their gates at his approach: but these baffling his utmost efforts, he returned to Motya, and pushed on the siege of that place with the utmost vigour.\n\nThe Carthaginians, in the mean time, though alarmed at the message sent them by Dionysius, and though reduced to a miserable situation by the plague which had broken out in their city, did not despond, but sent officers to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, with considerable sums, to raise troops with the utmost diligence. Ten galleys were also sent ships from Carthage to destroy all the ships that were found in the harbour of Syracuse. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a>, according to his orders, entered the harbour in the night, without being discovered by the enemy; and having sunk most of the ships he found there, returned without the loss of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>.\n\nAll this while the Motyans defended themselves with incredible vigour; while their enemies, deafened by the revenging the cruelties exercised upon their countrymen by the Carthaginians, fought like lions. At last the place was taken by storm, and the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> began a general massacre. For some time Dionysius was not able to restrain their fury: but at last he proclaimed that the Motyans should fly to the Greek temples; which they accordingly did, and a stop was put to the slaughter; but the soldiers took care thoroughly to plunder the town, in which they found a great treasure.\n\nThe following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, Dionysius invaded the Carthaginian territories, and made an attempt upon Egagla: but here he was again disappointed. The Carthaginians were greatly alarmed at his progress; but, next year, notwithstanding a considerable loss sustained in a sea-fight with Leptines, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIMILCO\">Himilco</a> their general landed a powerful army at Panormus, seized upon Eryx, and then advancing towards Motya, made himself master of it, before Dionysius could send any forces to its relief. He next advanced to Meliana, which he likewise besieged and took; after which most of the Siculi revolted from Dionysius.\n\nNotwithstanding this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFECTION\">defection</a>, Dionysius, finding his forces still amount to 30,000 foot and 3000 horse, advanced against the enemy. At the same time Leptines was sent with the Syracusan fleet against that of the Carthaginians, but with positive orders not to break the line of battle upon any account whatever. But, notwithstanding these orders, he thought proper to divide his fleet, and the consequence of this was a total defeat; above 100 of the Syracusan galleys being sunk or taken, and 20,000 of their men killed in the battle or in the pursuit. Dionysius, disheartened by this misfortune, returned with his army to Syracuse, being afraid that the Carthaginian fleet might become masters of that city, if he should advance to fight the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> army. Himilco did not fail immediately to invest the capital; and had certainly become master of it, and consequently of the whole island, had not a most malignant pestilence obliged him to desist from all further operations. This dreadful malady made great havoc among his forces both by sea and land; and to complete\nCarthage plete his misfortunes, Dionysius attacked him unexpectedly, totally ruined his fleet, and made himself master of his camp.\n\nHimilco, finding himself altogether unable to sustain another attack, was obliged to come to a private agreement with Dionysius; who for 300 talents consented to let him escape to Africa, with the shattered remains of his fleet and army. The unfortunate general arrived at Carthage, clad in mean and forlorn attire, where he was met by a great number of people bewailing their sad and inauspicious fortune. Himilco joined them in their lamentations; and being unable to survive his misfortunes, put an end to his own life. He had left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGO\">Mago</a> in Sicily, to take care of the Carthaginian interests in the best manner he could. In order to this, Mago treated all the Sicilians subject to Carthage with the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>; and having received a considerable number of soldiers from Africa, he at last formed an army with which he ventured a battle; in this he was defeated, and driven out of the field, with the loss of 800 men; which obliged him to desist from farther attempts of that nature.\n\nNotwithstanding all these terrible disasters, the Carthaginians could not forbear making new attempts upon the island of Sicily; and about the year before Christ 392, Mago landed in it with an army of 80,000 men. This attempt, however, was attended with no better success than before; Dionysius found means to reduce him to such straits for want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, that he was obliged to sue for peace. This continued for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> years, at the end of which the war was renewed with various successes. It continued with little interruption till the year before Christ 367, when the Syracusan state being rent by civil dissensions, the Carthaginians thought it a proper time to exert themselves, in order to become masters of the whole island. They fitted out a great fleet, and entered into alliance with Icetas, tyrant of Leontini, who pretended to have taken Syracuse under his protection. By this treaty, the two powers engaged to assist each other, in order to expel Dionysius II. after which they were to divide the island between them. The Syracusans applied for succours to the Corinthians; and they readily sent them a body of troops under the command of Timoleon an experienced general. By a stratagem, he got his forces landed at Tauromenium. The whole of them did not exceed 1200 in number; yet with these he marched against Icetas, who was at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of 5000 men; his army he surprized at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>, put 300 of them to the sword, and took 600 prisoners. He then marched to Syracuse, and broke into one part of the town before the enemy had any notice of his approach; here he took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a>, and defended himself with such resolution, that he could not be dislodged by the united power of Icetas and the Carthaginians.\n\nIn this place he remained for some time, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of a reinforcement from Corinth; till the arrival of which, he did not judge it practicable to extend his conquests.\u2014The Carthaginians being apprised that the Corinthian succours were detained by tempestuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> at Thurium, posted a strong squadron, under Hanno their admiral, to intercept them in their passage to Sicily. But that commander, not imagining the Corinthians would attempt a passage to Sicily in such a stormy season, left his station at Thurium, and Carthage, ordering his seamen to crown themselves with garlands, and adorn their vessels with bucklers both of the Greek and Carthaginian form, sailed to Syracuse in a triumphant manner. Upon his arrival there, he gave the troops in the citadel to understand, that he had taken the succours Timoleon expected, thinking by this means to intimidate them to surrender. But, while he thus trifled away his time, the Corinthians marched with great expedition to Rhegium, and, taking the advantage of a gentle breeze, were easily wafted over into Sicily. Mago, the Carthaginian general, was no sooner informed of the arrival of this reinforcement, than he of Mago was struck with terror, though the whole Corinthian army did not exceed 4000 men; and, soon after, fearing a revolt of his mercenaries, he weighed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCHOR\">anchor</a>, in spite of all the remonstrances of Icetas, and set sail for Africa. Here he no sooner arrived, than, overcome with grief and shame for his unparalleled cowardice, he laid violent hands on himself. His body was hung up on a gallows or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>, in order to deter succeeding generals from forfeiting their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> in so flagrant a manner.\n\nAfter the flight of Mago, Timoleon carried all before him. He obliged Icetas to renounce his alliance with the state of Carthage, and even deposed him, and continued his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> preparations with the greatest vigour. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the Carthaginians prepared for the ensuing campaign, with the greatest alacrity. An army of 70,000 men was sent over, with a fleet of 200 ships of war, and 1000 transports laden with warlike engines, armed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARIOTS\">chariots</a>, horses, and all other sorts of provisions. This immense multitude, however, was overthrown on the banks of the Crimea by Timoleon: 10,000 were left dead on the field of battle; and of these above 3000 were native Carthaginians of the best families in the city. Above 15,000 were taken prisoners; all their baggage and provisions, with 200 chariots, 1000 coats of mail, and 10,000 shields, fell into Timoleon's hands. The spoil, which consisted chiefly of gold and silver, was so immense, that the whole Sicilian army was three days in collecting it and stripping the slain. After this signal victory, he left his mercenary forces upon the frontiers of the enemy, to plunder and ravage the country; while he himself returned to Syracuse with the rest of his army, where he was received with the greatest demonstrations of joy. Soon after, Icetas, grown weary of his private station, concluded a new peace with the Carthaginians; and having assembled an army, ventured an engagement with Timoleon: but in this he was utterly defeated; and himself, with Eupolemus his son, and Euthymus general of his horse, were brought bound to Timoleon by their own soldiers. The two first were immediately executed as tyrants and traitors, and the last murdered in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> blood; Icetas's wives and daughters were likewise cruelly put to death after a public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>. In a short time after, Mamercus, another of the Carthaginian confederates, was overthrown by Timoleon, with the loss of 2000 men. These misfortunes induced the Carthaginians to conclude a peace on the following terms: That all the chided Greek cities should be set free; that the river Halycus should be the boundary between the territories of both parties; that the natives of the cities, subject to the Carthaginians,\nCarthage. Carthaginians, should be allowed to withdraw, if they pleaded, to Syracuse, or its dependencies, with their families and effects; and lastly, that Carthage should not, for the future, give any affiance to the remaining tyrants against Syracuse.\n\nAbout 316 years before Christ, we find the Carthaginians engaged in another bloody war with the Sicilians, on the following occasion: Sofistratus, who had usurped the supreme authority at Syracuse, having been forced by Agathocles to raise the siege of Rhegium, returned with his shattered troops to Sicily. But soon after this unsuccessful expedition he was obliged to abdicate the sovereignty and quit Syracuse. With him were expelled above 600 of the principal citizens, who were suspected of having formed a design to overturn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of government which then prevailed in the city. As Sofistratus and the exiles thought themselves ill treated, they had recourse to the Carthaginians, who readily espoused their cause. Hereupon the Syracusans having recalled Agathocles, who had before been banished by Sofistratus, appointed him commander in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of all their forces, principally on account of the known aversion he bore that tyrant. The war, however, did not then continue long; for Sofistratus and the exiles were quickly received again into the city, and peace was concluded with Carthage: the people of Syracuse, however, finding that Agathocles wanted to make himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a>, exacted an oath from him, that he would do nothing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMOCRACY\">democracy</a>. But, notwithstanding this oath, Agathocles pursued his purpose, and by a general massacre of the principal citizens of Syracuse raised himself to the throne. For some time he was obliged to keep the peace he had concluded with Carthage; but at last finding his authority established, and that his subjects were ready to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> his ambitious designs, he paid no regard to his treaties, but immediately made war on the neighbouring states, which he had expressly agreed not to do, and then carried his arms into the very heart of the island. In these expeditions he was attended with such success, that in two years time he brought into subjection all the Greek part of Sicily. This being accomplished, he committed great devastations in the Carthaginian territories, their general Hamilcar not offering to give him the least disturbance. This perfidious conduct greatly incensed the people of those districts against Hamilcar, whom they accused before the senate. He died, however, in Sicily; and Hamilcar the son of Gisco was appointed to succeed him in the command of the forces. The last place that held out against Agathocles was Messina, whither all the Syracusan exiles had retired. Papphilius, Agathocles's general, found means to cajole the inhabitants into a treaty; which Agathocles, according to custom, paid no regard to, but, as soon as he was in possession of the town, cut off all those who had opposed his government. For, as he intended to prosecute the war with the utmost vigour against Carthage, he thought it a point of good policy to destroy as many of his Sicilian enemies as possible.\n\nThe Carthaginians in the meantime having landed a powerful army in Sicily, an engagement soon ensued, in which Agathocles was defeated with the loss of 7000 men. After this defeat he was obliged to shut himself up in Syracuse, which the Carthaginians immediately invested, and most of the Greek states in the island submitted to them.\n\nAgathocles seeing himself stripped of almost all his dominions, and his capital itself in danger of falling into the hands of the enemy, formed a design, which, were it not attested by writers of undoubted authority, would seem absolutely incredible. This was no less than to transfer the war into Africa, and lay siege to the enemy's capital, at a time when he himself was besieged, and only one city left to him in all Sicily. Before he departed, however, he made all the necessary preparations for the defence of the place, and appointed his brother Antandrus governor of it. He also gave permission to all who were not willing to stand the fatigues of a siege to retire out of the city. Many of the principal citizens, Justin says 1600, accepted of this offer; but they were no sooner got out of the place, than they were cut off by parties posted on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> for that purpose. Having seized upon their estates, Agathocles raised a considerable sum, which was intended in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> to defray the expense of the expedition; however, he carried with him only 50 talents to supply his present wants, being well assured that he should find in the enemy's country whatever was necessary for his subsistence. As the Carthaginians had a much superior fleet, they for some time kept the mouth of the harbour blocked up; but at last a fair opportunity offered; and Agathocles hoisting sail, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> of his rowers soon got clear both of the port and city of Syracuse. The Carthaginians pursued him with all possible expedition; but, notwithstanding their utmost efforts, Agathocles got his troops landed with very little opposition.\n\nSoon after his forces were landed, Agathocles burnt his fleet, probably that his soldiers might behave with his fleet the greater resolution, as they saw no possibility of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> from their danger. He first advanced to a place called the Great City. This, after a feeble resistance, he took and plundered. From hence he marched to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUNIS\">Tunis</a>, which surrendered on the first summons; and Agathocles levelled both places with the ground.\n\nThe Carthaginians were at first thrown into the greatest consternation; but soon recovering themselves, the citizens took up arms with so much alacrity, that in a few days they had on foot an army of 42,000 foot and 1000 horse, with 2000 armed chariots. The command of this army they entrusted to Hannibal and Bomilcar, two generals between whom there subsisted a great animosity. This occasioned the defeat of their Carthaginian whole army, with the loss of their camp, though all their forces of Agathocles did not exceed 14,000 in number. Among other rich spoils the conqueror found many chariots of curious workmanship, which carried 20,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of fetters and manacles that the enemy had provided for the Sicilian prisoners. After this defeat, the Carthaginians, supposing themselves to have fallen under the displeasure of their deities on account of their neglecting to sacrifice children of noble families to them, resolved to expiate this guilt. Accordingly 200 children of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> were sacrificed to their bloody gods, besides 300 other persons who voluntarily offered themselves to pacify the wrath of these deities.\n\nAfter these expiations, Hamilcar was recalled from Sicily.\nWhen the messengers arrived, Hamilcar commanded them not once to mention the victory of Agathocles; but, on the contrary, to give out among the troops that he had been entirely defeated, his forces all cut off, and his fleet destroyed by the Carthaginians. This threw the Syracusans into the utmost despair; however, one Eurymnon, an Eolian, prevailed upon Antandrus not to consent to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a>, but to stand a general assault. Hamilcar being informed of this, prepared his battering engines, and made all the necessary preparations to storm the town without delay. But while matters remained in this situation, a galley, which Agathocles had caused to be built immediately after the battle, got into the harbour of Syracuse, and acquainted the inhabitants with the certainty of Agathocles' victory. Hamilcar observing that the garrison flocked down to the port on this occasion, and expecting to find the walls unguarded, ordered his soldiers to erect scaling-ladders, and begin the intended assault. The enemy having left the ramparts quite exposed, the Carthaginians mounted them without being discovered, and had almost possessed themselves of an entire part lying between two towers, when the patrol discovered them. Upon this a warm dispute ensued; but at last the Carthaginians were repulsed with loss. Hamilcar, therefore, finding it in vain to continue the siege after such glad tidings had restored life and soul to the Syracusans, drew off his forces, and sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> of 5000 men to reinforce the troops in Africa. He still entertained hopes, however, that he might oblige Agathocles to quit Africa, and return to the defence of his own dominions. He spent some time in making himself master of such cities as sided with the Syracusans; and after having brought all their allies under subjection, returned again to Syracuse, hoping to surprise it by an attack in the night-time. But being attacked while advancing through narrow passes, where his numerous army had not room to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, he was defeated with great slaughter, and himself taken prisoner, carried into Syracuse, and put to death.\n\nIn the mean time the Agrigentines, finding that the Carthaginians and Syracusans had greatly weakened each other by this war, thought it a proper opportunity to attempt the sovereignty of the whole island. They therefore commenced a war against both parties; and prosecuted it with such success, that in a short time they wrested many places of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> both out of the hands of the Syracusans and Carthaginians.\n\nIn Africa the tyrant carried everything before him. He reduced most of the places of any note in the territory of Carthage; and hearing that Elymas king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBYA\">Libya</a> had declared against him, he immediately entered Libya Superior, and in a great battle overthrew that prince, putting to the sword a good part of his troops, and the general who commanded them; after which he advanced against the Carthaginians with such expedition, that he surprised and defeated them with the loss of 2000 killed, and a great number taken prisoners. He next prepared for the siege of Carthage itself; and in order thereto advanced to a post within five miles of that city. On the other hand, notwithstanding the great losses they had already sustained, the Carthaginians, with a powerful army, encamped between him and their capital. In this situation Agathocles received advice of the defeat of the Carthaginian forces before Syracuse, and the head of Hamilcar their general. Upon this he immediately rode up to the enemy's camp, and showing them the head, gave them an account of the total destruction of their army before Syracuse. This threw them into such consternation, that in all human probability Agathocles would have made himself master of Carthage, had not an unexpected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTINY\">mutiny</a> arisen in his camp, which gave the Carthaginians an opportunity of recovering from their terror.\n\nThe year following an engagement happened, in which neither party gained any great advantage: but an alliance soon after, the tyrant, notwithstanding all his victories, found himself unable to carry on the war alone; and therefore endeavoured to gain over to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> Ophellas, one of the captains of Alexander the Great. In this he perfectly succeeded; and to succour his new ally the more effectually, Ophellas sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a> for a body of troops. Having finished his military preparations, Ophellas found his army to consist of 10,000 foot and 600 horse, all regular troops, besides 100 chariots, and a body of 10,000 men, attended by their wives and children, as though he had been going to plant a new colony. At the head of these forces he continued his march towards Agathocles for 18 days; and then encamped at Automalas, a city about 3000 stadia distant from the capital of his dominions. From thence he advanced through the Regio Syrta; but found himself reduced to such extremities, that his army was in danger of perishing for want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and other provisions. They were also greatly annoyed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a> and wild beasts, with which that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> region abounded. The serpents made the greatest havoc among the troops; for, being of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and extremely venomous, many soldiers, who trod upon them without seeing them, were flung to death. At last, after a very fatiguing march of two months, he approached Agathocles, and encamped at a small distance from him, to the no small terror of the Carthaginians, who apprehended the most fatal consequences from this junction. Agathocles at first cared for him, and advised him to take all possible care of his troops that treacherous had undergone so many fatigues; but soon after cut him off by treachery, and then by fair words and promises persuaded his troops to serve under himself.\n\nAgathocles now finding himself at the head of a numerous army, assumed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of King of Africa, intending soon to complete his conquests by the reduction of Carthage. He began with the siege of Utica, which was taken by assault. After this he marched against Hippo Diarrhytus, the Biferta of the moderns, which was also taken by storm; and after this most of the people bordering upon the sea coasts, and even those who inhabited the inland parts of the country, submitted to him. But in the midst of this obliged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> of success, the Sicilians formed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> in return favour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>; which obliged the tyrant to return home, leaving his son Archagathus to carry on the war in Africa.\n\nArchagathus, after his father's departure, greatly extended the African conquests. He sent Eumachus Archagathus at the head of a large detachment to invade some of the neighbouring provinces, while he himself, with\nCarthage, the greatest part of his army, observed the motions of the Carthaginians. Eumachus falling into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMIDIA\">Numidia</a>, first took the great city of Tocas, and conquered several of the Numidian cantons. Afterwards he besieged and took Phellina; which was attended with the submission of the Aphrodoladians, a nation, according to Diodorus, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> as the Ethiopians. He then reduced several cities; and being at last elated with such a run of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a>, resolved to penetrate into the more remote parts of Africa. Here he at first met with success; but hearing that the barbarous nations were advancing in a formidable body to give him battle, he abandoned his conquests, and retreated with the utmost precipitation towards the sea coasts, after having lost abundance of men.\n\nThis unfortunate expedition made a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> for the worse in the affairs of Archagathus. The Carthaginians being informed of Eumachus's bad success, resolved to exert themselves in an extraordinary manner to repair their former losses. They divided their forces into three bodies: one of these they sent to the sea coasts, to keep the towns there in awe; another they despatched into the Mediterranean parts, to preserve the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> of the inhabitants there; and the last body they ordered to the Upper Africa, to support their confederates in that country. Archagathus being apprised of the motions of the Carthaginians, divided his forces likewise into three bodies. One of these he sent to observe the Carthaginian troops on the sea coasts, with orders to advance afterwards into the Upper Africa; another under the command of \u00c6schron, one of his generals, he posted at a proper distance in the heart of the country, to have an eye both on the enemy there and the barbarous nations; and with the last, which he led in person, he kept nearer Carthage, preserving a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with the other two, in order to send them succours, or recall them, as the exigency of affairs should require.\u2014The Carthaginian troops sent into the heart of the country, were commanded by Hannibal, a general of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, who being informed of the approach of \u00c6schron, laid an ambuscade for him, into which he was drawn and cut off with 4000 foot and 200 horse. Himilco, who commanded the Carthaginian forces in Upper Africa, having advice of Eumachus's march, immediately advanced against him. An engagement ensued, in which the Greeks were almost totally cut off, or perished with thirst after the battle, out of 8000 foot only 30, and of 800 horse only 40, having the good fortune to make their escape.\n\nArchagathus receiving the melancholy news of these two defeats, immediately called in the detachments he had sent out to harass the enemy, which would otherwise have been instantly cut off. He was, however, in a short time hemmed in on all sides, in such a manner as to be reduced to the last extremity for want of provisions, and ready every moment to be swallowed up by the numerous forces which surrounded him. In this deplorable situation Agathocles received an express from Archagathus, acquainting him of the losses he had sustained and the scarcity of provisions he laboured under. Upon this the tyrant, leaving the care of the Sicilian war to one Leptines, by a stratagem got 18 Etruscan ships that came to his assistance out of the harbour; and then engaging the Carthaginian squadron which lay in its neighbourhood, took five of their ships, and made all their men prisoners. By this means he became master of the port, and secured a passage into it for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> of all nations, which soon restored plenty to that city, where the famine before had begun to make great havoc. Supplying himself, therefore, with a sufficient quantity of necessaries for the voyage he was going to undertake, he immediately set sail for Africa.\n\nUpon his arrival in this country, Agathocles reviewed his forces, and found them to consist of 6000 Greeks, as many Samnites, Celtes, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETRUSCANS\">Etruscans</a>; besides 10,000 Africans, and 1500 horse. As he found his troops almost in a state of despair, he thought this a proper time for offering the enemy battle. The Carthaginians, however, did not think proper to accept the challenge; especially as by keeping <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> in their camp, where they had plenty of everything, they could starve the Greeks to a surrender without striking a stroke. Upon this Agathocles attacked the Carthaginian camp with great bravery, made a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> upon it, and might perhaps have carried it, had not his mercenaries deserted him almost successively at the first onset. By this piece of cowardice he was forced to retire with precipitation to his camp, whither the Carthaginians pursued him very closely, doing great execution in the pursuit.\n\nThe next night, the Carthaginians sacrificed all the prisoners of distinction as a grateful acknowledgment to the gods for the victory they had gained. While they were employed in this inhuman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, suddenly rising, carried the flames to the sacred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABERNACLE\">tabernacle</a> near the altar, which was entirely consumed, as well as the general's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENT\">tent</a>, and those of the principal officers adjoining to it. A dreadful alarm took place through the whole camp, which was heightened by the great progress the fire made. For the soldiers' tents consisting of very combustible materials, and the wind blowing in a most violent manner, the whole camp was almost entirely laid in ashes; and many of the soldiers endeavouring to carry off their arms, and the rich baggage of their officers, perished in the flames. Some of those who made their escape met with a fate equally unhappy: For, after Agathocles had received the last blow, the Africans deserted him, and were in that instant coming over in a body to the Carthaginians. These, the persons who were flying from the flames took to be the whole Syracusan army advancing in order of battle to attack their camp. Upon this a dreadful confusion ensued. Some took to their heels; others fell down in heaps one upon another; and others engaged their comrades, mistaking them for the enemy. Five thousand men lost their lives in this tumult, and the rest thought proper to take refuge within the walls of Carthage; nor could the appearance of daylight, for some time, dissipate their terrible apprehensions. In the meantime the African deserters, observing the great confusion the Carthaginians were in, and not knowing the meaning of it, were so terrified, that they thought proper to return to the place from whence they came. The Syracusans seeing a body of troops advancing towards them in good order, concluded that the enemy were\nwere marching to attack them, and therefore immediately cried out, \"To arms.\" The flames ascending out of the Carthaginian camp into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and the lamentable outcry proceeding from thence, confirmed them in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, and greatly heightened their confusion. The consequence was much the same as in the Carthaginian camp; for coming to blows with one another instead of the enemy, they scarce recovered their senses upon the return of light, and the intestine fray was so bloody that it cost Agathocles 4000 men.\n\nThe last disaster so disheartened the tyrant, that he immediately set about contriving means for making his escape privately; and this he at last, though with great difficulty, effected. After his departure, his two sons were immediately put to death by the soldiers, who, choosing a leader from among themselves, made peace with the Carthaginians upon the following conditions: 1. That the Greeks should deliver up all the places they held in Africa, receiving from them 300 talents; 2. That such of them as were willing to serve in the Carthaginian army should be kindly treated, and receive the usual pay; and 3. That the rest should be transported to Sicily, and have the city of Selinus for their habitation.\n\nFrom this time, to that of their first war with the Romans, we find nothing remarkable in the history of the Carthaginians. The first Punic war, as it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called, happened about 256 years before Christ. At that time the Carthaginians were possessed of extensive dominions in Africa; they had made considerable progress in Spain; they were masters of Sardinia, Corsica, and all the islands on the coast of Italy; and had extended their conquests to a great part of Sicily. The occasion of the first rupture between the two republics was as follows: The Mamertines being vanquished in battle, and reduced to great straits by Hiero king of Syracuse, had resolved to deliver up Messina, the only city they now possessed, to that prince, with whole mild government and strict probity they were well acquainted. Accordingly, Hiero was advancing at the head of his troops to take possession of the city, when Hannibal, who at that time commanded the Carthaginian army in Sicily, prevented him by a stratagem. He came to meet Hiero, as it were to congratulate him on his victory; and amused him, while some of the Carthaginian troops filed off towards Messina. Hereupon the Mamertines, feeling their city supported by a new reinforcement, were divided into several opinions. Some were for accepting the protection of Carthage; others were for surrendering to the king of Syracuse; but the greater part were for calling in the Romans to their assistance. Deputies were accordingly despatched to Rome, offering the possession of the city to the Romans, and in the most moving terms imploring protection. This, after some debate, was agreed to; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a> Appius Claudius received orders to attempt a passage to Sicily, at the head of a powerful army. Being obliged to stay some time at Rome, however, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIUS\">Caius</a> Claudius, a person of great intrepidity and resolution, was despatched with a few vessels to Rhegium. On his arrival there, he observed the Carthaginian squadron to be so much superior to his own, that he thought it would be little better than madness to attempt at that time to transport forces to Carthage, Sicily. He crossed the straits, however, and had a conference with the Mamertines, in which he prevailed upon them all to accept of the protection of Rome; and on this he made the necessary preparations for transporting his forces. The Carthaginians being informed of the resolutions of the Romans, sent a strong squadron of galleys under the command of Hanno, to intercept the Roman fleet; and accordingly the Carthaginian admiral, coming up with them near the coast of Sicily, attacked them with great fury. During the engagement, a violent storm arose, which dashed many of the Roman vessels against the rocks, and did a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of damage to their squadron; by which means Claudius was forced to retire to Rhegium, and this he accomplished with great difficulty. Hanno restored all the vessels he had taken; but ordered the deputies sent with them to expostulate with the Roman general upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFRACTION\">infraction</a> of the treaties subsisting between the two republics. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPOSTULATION\">expostulation</a>, however <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a>, produced an open rupture; Claudius soon after possessing himself of Messina.\n\nSuch was the beginning of the first Punic war, which is said to have lasted 24 years. The first year, the Carthaginians and Syracusans laid siege to Messina; but not acting in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> as they ought to have done, were overthrown by the consul Appius Claudius; and this defeat so much disgusted Hiero with the Carthaginians, that he soon after concluded an alliance with the Romans. After this treaty, having no enemy to contend with but the Carthaginians, the Romans made themselves masters of all the cities on the western coast of Sicily, and at the end of the campaign carried back most of their troops with them to take up their winter-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> in Italy.\n\nThe second year, Hanno the Carthaginian general fixed his principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">magazine</a> at Agrigentum. This town taken place was very strong by nature, had been rendered almost impregnable by the new fortifications raised by the Carthaginians during the preceding winter, and was defended by a numerous garrison commanded by one Hannibal, a general of great experience in war. For five months the Romans attempted to reduce the place by famine, and had actually brought the inhabitants to great distress, when a Carthaginian army of 50,000 foot, 6000 horse, and 60 elephants, landed at Lilybeum, and from thence marched to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HERACLEA\">Heraclea</a>, within 20 miles of Agrigentum. There the general received a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPUTATION\">deputation</a> from some of the inhabitants of Erbella, where the Romans had their magazines, offering to put the town into his hands. It was accordingly delivered up; and by this means the Romans became so much distressed, that they had certainly been obliged to abandon their enterprise, had not Hiero supplied them with provisions. But all the assistance he was able to give could not long have supported them, as their army was so much weakened by disorders occasioned by famine, that, out of 100,000 men of whom it originally consisted, scarce a fourth part remained fit for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, and could no longer subsist on such parsimonious supplies. But in the mean time Hannibal acquainted Hanno that the city was reduced to the utmost distress; upon which he resolved to venture an engagement, which he had before declined. In this the Romans were victorious, and the city surrendered.\nCarthage, rendered at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a>, though Hannibal with the greatest part of the garrison made their escape. This ended the campaign; and the Carthaginians being greatly chagrined at their bad success, fined Hannibal of an immense sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, and deprived him of his command, appointing Hamilcar to succeed him in the command of the land army, and Hannibal in that of the fleet.\n\nThe third year, Hannibal received orders to ravage the coast of Italy; but the Romans had taken care to post detachments in such places as were most proper to prevent his landing, so that the Carthaginian found it impossible to execute his orders. At the same time, the Romans, perceiving the advantages of being masters of the sea, set about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> 120 galleys. While this was doing, they made themselves masters of most of the inland cities, but the Carthaginians reduced or kept steady in their interest most of the maritime ones; so that both parties were equally successful during this campaign.\n\nThe fourth year, Hannibal by a stratagem made himself master of 17 Roman galleys; after which he committed great ravages on the coast of Italy, whither he had advanced to take a view of the Roman fleet. But he was afterwards attacked in his turn, lost the greatest part of his ships, and with great difficulty made his own escape. Soon after he was totally defeated by the consul Duilius, with the loss of 80 ships taken, 13 sunk, 7000 men killed, and as many taken prisoners. After this victory Duilius landed in Sicily, put himself at the head of the land forces, relieved Segesta, besieged by Hamilcar, and made himself master of Macella, though defended by a numerous garrison.\n\nThe fifth year a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> arose between the Romans and their Sicilian allies, which came to such a height, that they encamped separately. Of this Hamilcar availed himself, and attacking the Sicilians in their entrenchments, put 4000 of them to the sword. He then drove the Romans from their posts, took several cities from them, and overran the greatest part of the country. In the mean time, Hannibal, after his defeat, failed with the shattered remains of his fleet to Carthage: but in order to secure himself from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, he sent one of his friends with all speed, before the event of the battle was known there, to acquaint the senate, that the Romans had put to sea with a good number of heavy ill-built vessels, each of them carrying some machine, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of which the Carthaginians did not understand; and asked whether it was the opinion of the senate that Hannibal should attack them? These machines were the corvi, which were then newly invented, and by means of which, chiefly, Duilius had gained the victory. The senate were unanimous in their opinion that the Romans should be attacked; upon which the messenger acquainted them with the unfortunate event of the battle. As the senators had already declared themselves for the engagement, they spared their general's life, and, according to Polybius, even continued him in the command of the fleet. In a short time, being reinforced by a good number of galleys, and attended by some officers of great merit, he sailed for the coast of Sardinia. He had not been long here, before he was surprised by the Romans, who carried off many of his ships, and took great numbers of his men prisoners. Carthage, this to incensed the rest, that they seized their unfortunate admiral, and crucified him; but who was his immediate successor does not appear.\n\nThe sixth year, the Romans made themselves masters of the islands of Corsica and Sardinia. Hannibal, who commanded the Carthaginian forces in the latter, defended himself at a city called Olbia with incredible bravery; but being at last killed in one of the attacks, the place was surrendered, and the Romans soon became masters of the whole island.\n\nThe seventh year, the Romans took the town of Mytilenaeum, in Sicily, from whence they marched towards Camarina, but in their way were surrounded in a deep valley, and in the most imminent danger of being cut off by the Carthaginian army. In this extremity, a legionary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUNE\">tribune</a>, by name M. Calpurnius Flamma, desired the general to give him 300 chosen of a legion; promising, with this small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>, to find nary tri-bune the enemy such employment as should oblige them to leave a passage open for the Roman army. He performed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> with a bravery truly heroic; for, having feigned, in spite of all opposition, an eminence, and entrenched himself on it, the Carthaginians, jealous of his design, flocked from all quarters to drive him from his post. But the brave tribune kept their whole army in play, till the consul taking advantage of the diversion, drew his army out of the bad situation in which he had imprudently brought it. The legions were no sooner out of danger, than they hastened to the relief of their brave companions: but all they could do was to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> their bodies from the insults of their enemies; for they found them all dead on the spot, except Calpurnius, who lay under a heap of dead bodies all covered with wounds, but still breathing. His wounds were immediately dressed, and it fortunately happened that none of them proved mortal; and for this glorious enterprise he received a crown of grain. After this the Romans reduced several cities, and drove the enemy quite out of the territory of the Agrigentines; but were repulsed with great loss before Lipara.\n\nThe eighth year, Regulus, who commanded the Carthaginian fleet, observing that of the Carthaginians lying along the coast in disorder, sailed with a squadron of the Roman fleet, to observe their number and strength, ordering the rest of the fleet to follow him with all expedition. But as he drew too near the enemy, he was surrounded by a great number of Carthaginian galleys. The Romans fought with their usual bravery; but being overpowered with numbers, were obliged to yield. The consul, however, found means to make his escape, and joined the rest of the fleet; and then had his full revenge of the enemy, 18 of their ships being taken, and eight sunk.\n\nThe ninth year, the Romans made preparations for invading Africa. Their fleet for this purpose consisted of 330 galleys, each of them having on board 120 soldiers and 300 rowers. The Carthaginian fleet consisted of 360 sail, and was much better manned than that of the Romans. The two fleets met near Ecnomus, a promontory in Sicily; where, after a bloody engagement, which lasted the greater part of the day, the Carthaginians were entirely defeated, with the loss of 30 galleys sunk, and 63 taken with all their men.\nThe Romans lost only 24 galleys, which were all sunk. After this victory, the Romans having refitted their fleet, set sail for the coast of Africa with all expedition. The first land they got sight of was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> Hafar, where the fleet lay at anchor for some time waiting till the galleys and transports came up. From thence they coasted along till they arrived before Clupea, a city to the east of Carthage, where they made their first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>.\n\nNo words can express the consternation of the Carthaginians on the arrival of the Romans in Africa. The inhabitants of Clupea were so terrified, that according to Zonaras, they abandoned the place, which the Romans immediately took possession of. Having left there a strong garrison to secure their shipping, and keep the adjacent territory in awe, they moved nearer Carthage, taking a great number of towns; they likewise plundered a prodigious number of villages, laid vast numbers of noblemen's feats in ashes, and took above 20,000 prisoners. In short, having plundered and ravaged the whole country, almost to the gates of Carthage, they returned to Clupea loaded with the immense booty they had acquired in the expedition.\n\nThe tenth year, Regulus pushed on his conquests with great rapidity. To oppose his progress, Hamilcar was recalled from Sicily, and with him Bostar and Asdrubal were joined in command. Hamilcar commanded an army just equal to that of Regulus. The other two commanded separate bodies, which were to join him or act apart as occasion required. But, before they were in a condition to take the field, Regulus, pursuing his conquests, arrived on the banks of the Bagrada, a river which empties itself into the sea at a small distance from Carthage. Here he had a monstrous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENT\">serpent</a> to contend with, which, according to the accounts of those days, infected the waters of the river, poisoned the air, and killed all other animals with its breath alone. When the Romans went to draw water, this huge dragon attacked them; and, twisting itself round their bodies, either squeezed them to death, or swallowed them alive. As its hard and thick scales were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> against their darts and arrows, they were forced to have recourse to the balista, which they made use of in sieges to throw great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> down the walls of besieged cities. With these they discharged showers of huge stones against this new enemy, and had the good luck with one of them, to break his back-bone; which disabled him from twisting and winding his immense body, and by that means gave the Romans an opportunity of approaching and dispatching him with their darts. But his dead body corrupted the air and the water of the river; and spread so great an infection over the whole country, that the Romans were obliged to decamp. We are told that Regulus sent to Rome the skin of this monster, which was 120 feet long; and that it was hung up in a temple, where it was preserved to the time of the Numantine war.\n\nHaving passed this river, he besieged Adis, or Aida, not far from Carthage, which the enemy attempted to relieve; but as they lay encamped among hills and rocks, where their elephants, in which the main strength of their army consisted, could be of no use. Regulus attacked them in their camp, killed 17,000 of them and took 5900 prisoners, and 18 elephants. Upon Carthage, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of this victory, deputations came from all quarters, in order that the conqueror in a few days became master of 80 towns: among which were the city and port of Utica. This increased the alarm at Carthage; which was reduced to despair, when Regulus laid siege to Tunis, a great city about nine miles from the capital. The place was taken in sight of the Carthaginians, who, from their walls, beheld all the operations of the siege, without making the least attempt to relieve it. And to complete their misfortunes, the Numidians, their neighbours, and implacable enemies, entered their territories, committing everywhere the most dreadful devastations, which soon occasioned a great scarcity of provisions in the city. The public magazines were soon exhausted; and, as the city was full of selfish merchants, who took advantage of the public distress, to sell provisions at an exorbitant price, a famine ensued, with all the evils which attend it.\n\nIn this extremity Regulus advanced to the very gates of Carthage; and having encamped under the walls, sent deputies to treat of a peace with the senate. The deputies were received with inexplicable joy; but the conditions they proposed were such that the senate could not hear them without the greatest indignation. They were, 1. That the Carthaginians should relinquish all claims to Sardinia, Corsica, and Sicily. 2. That they should restore to the Romans all the prisoners they had taken from them since the beginning of the war. 3. That if they cared to redeem any of their own prisoners, they should pay so much a-head for them as Rome should judge reasonable. 4. That they should for ever pay the Romans an annual tribute. 5. That for the future they should fit out but one man of war for their own use, and 50 triremes to serve in the Roman fleet, at the expense of Carthage, when required by any of the future consuls. These extravagant demands provoked the senators, who loudly and unanimously rejected them; the Roman deputies, however, told them that Regulus would not alter a single letter of the proposals, and that they must either conquer the Romans or obey them.\n\nIn this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> distress, some mercenaries arrived from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, among whom was a Lacedemonian, by name Xanthippus, a man of great valour and experience in war. This man, having informed himself of the circumstances of the late battle, declared publicly, an army, that their overthrow was more owing to their own misconduct than to the superiority of the enemy. This discourse being spread abroad, came at last to the knowledge of the senate; and by them, and even by the desire of the Carthaginian generals themselves, Xanthippus was appointed commander in chief of their forces. His first care was to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> his troops in a proper manner. He taught them how to march, encamp, widen and close their ranks, and rally after the Lacedemonian manner under their proper colours. He then took the field with 12,000 foot, 4,000 horse, and 100 elephants. The Romans were surprized at the sudden alteration they observed in the enemy's conduct: but Regulus, elated with his last success, came and encamped at a small distance from the Carthaginian army in a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, where their elephants\nCarthage and horse had room to act. The two armies were parted by a river, which Regulus boldly passed, by which means he left no room for a retreat in case of any misfortune. The engagement began with great fury; but ended in the total defeat of the Romans, who, except 2000 that escaped to Clupea, were all killed or taken prisoners, and among the latter was Regulus himself. The loss of the Carthaginians scarce exceeded 800 men.\n\nThe Carthaginians remained on the field of battle till they had stripped the slain; and then entered their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>, which was almost the only place left them, in great triumph. They treated all their prisoners with great humanity, except Regulus; but as for him, he had so insulted them in his prosperity, that they could not forbear showing the highest marks of their resentment. According to Zonaras and others, he was thrown into a dungeon, where he had only sustenance allowed him barely sufficient to keep him alive. Nay, his cruel masters, to heighten his other torments, ordered a huge elephant (at the sight of which animal, it seems, he was greatly terrified) to be constantly placed near him; which prevented him from enjoying any tranquillity or repose.\n\nThe eleventh year of this war, the Carthaginians, elated with their victory over Regulus, began to talk in a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> strain, threatening Italy itself with an invasion. To prevent this, the Romans took care to garrison all their maritime towns, and fitted out a new fleet. In the mean time, the Carthaginians besieged Clupea and Utica in vain, being obliged to abandon their enterprise, upon hearing that the Romans were equipping a fleet of 350 sail. The Carthaginians having with incredible expedition refitted their old vessels, and built a good number of new ones, met the Roman fleet off Cape Hermea. An engagement ensued, in which the Carthaginians were utterly defeated; 104 of their ships being sunk, 30 taken, and 15,000 of their soldiers and rowers killed in the action. The Romans pursued their course to Clupea, where they were no sooner landed, than they found themselves attacked by the Carthaginian army, under the two Hannos, father and son. But, as the brave Xanthippos no longer commanded their army, notwithstanding the Lacedemonian discipline he had introduced among them, they were routed at the very first onset, with the loss of 9000 men, and among them many of their chief lords.\n\nNotwithstanding all their victories, however, the Romans found themselves now obliged, for want of provisions, to evacuate both Clupea and Utica, and abandon Africa altogether. Being desirous of signifying the end of their consulship by some important conquest on Sicily, the consuls steered for that island, contrary to the advice of their pilots, who represented their danger, on account of the season being so far advanced. Their obstinacy proved the destruction of the whole fleet; for a violent storm arising, out of 370 vessels only 80 escaped shipwreck, the rest being swallowed up by the sea, or dashed against the rocks. This was by far the greatest loss that Rome had ever sustained; for besides the ships that were cast away with their crews, a numerous army was destroyed, with all the riches of Africa, which had been by Regulus amassed and deposited in Clupea, and were now from thence transporting to Rome. The whole coast from Pachinum to Camerina was covered with dead bodies and wrecks of ships; so that history can scarce afford an example of such a dreadful disaster.\n\nThe twelfth year, the Carthaginians hearing of this misfortune of the Romans, renewed the war in Sicily with fresh fury, hoping the whole island, which was now left defenceless, would fall into their hands. Carthalo, a Carthaginian commander, besieged and took Agrigentum. The town he laid in ashes, and demolished the walls, obliging the inhabitants to fly to Olymum. Upon the news of this success, Adrubar was sent to Sicily with a large reinforcement of troops, the Carthalo and 150 elephants. They likewise fitted out a squadron, with which they retook the island of Coreya, and marched a strong body of forces into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAURITANIA\">Mauritania</a> and Numidia, to punish the people of those countries for showing a disposition to join the Romans. In Sicily the Romans possessed themselves of Cephalodium and Panormus, but were obliged by Carthalo to raise the siege of Drepanum with great loss.\n\nThe 13th year, the Romans sent out a fleet of 260 galleys, which appeared off Lilybaeum in Sicily; but finding this place too strong, they steered from thence to the eastern coast of Africa, where they made several descents, surprized some cities, and plundered several towns and villages. They arrived safe at Panormus, and in a few days set sail for Italy, having a fair wind till they came off Cape Palinurus, where a violent storm overtook them, that 160 of their galleys and a great number of their transports were lost; upon which the Roman senate made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a>, that for the future no more than 50 vessels should be equipped; and that these should be employed only in guarding the coast of Italy, and transporting the troops into Sicily.\n\nThe 14th year, the Romans made themselves masters of Himera and Lipara in Sicily; and the Carthaginians conceiving new hopes of conquering that island, began to make fresh levies in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a> and Spain, and to equip a new fleet. But their treasuries being exhausted, they applied to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a> king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, intreating him to lend them 2000 talents; but he being resolved to stand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEUTER\">neuter</a>, refused to comply with their request; telling them that he could not, without breach of fidelity, assist one friend against another. However, the republic of Carthage making an effort, equipped a fleet of 200 sail, and raised an army of 30,000 men, horse and foot, and 140 elephants, appointing Adrubar commander in chief both of the fleet and army. The Romans then finding the great advantages of a fleet, resolved to equip one, notwithstanding all former disasters; and while the vessels were building, two consuls were chosen, men of valour and experience, to supersede the acting ones in Sicily. Metellus, however, one of the former consuls, being continued with the title of proconsul, found means to draw Adrubar into a battle on disadvantageous terms near Panormus, and then falling out upon him, gave him a most terrible overthrow. Twenty thousand of the enemy were killed, and many elephants. An hundred and four elephants were taken with their leaders, and sent to Rome, where they were hunted and put to death in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CIRCUS\">circus</a>.\n\nThe 15th year the Romans besieged Lilybaeum;\nCarthage, and the siege continued during the rest of the first Punic war, and was the only thing remarkable that happened during that time*. The Carthaginians, beleaguered by the first news of its being besieged, sent Regulus with some deputies to Rome to treat of a peace; but instead of forwarding the negotiation, he hindered it; and notwithstanding he knew the torments prepared for him at Carthage, could not be prevailed upon to stay at Rome, but returning to his enemies country, was put to a most cruel death. During this siege, the Roman fleet under Claudius Pulcher was utterly defeated by Adherbal the Carthaginian admiral. Ninety of the Roman galleys were lost in the action, 8000 of their men either killed or drowned, and 20,000 taken and sent prisoners to Carthage; and the Carthaginians gained this signal victory without the loss of a single ship, or even a single man. Another Roman fleet met fleet utterly with a still feaver fate. It consisted of 120 galleys, destroyed 800 transports, and was laden with all sort of military stores and provisions. Every one of these vessels was left by a storm, with all they contained, not a single plank being saved that could be used again; so that the Romans found themselves once more deprived of their whole naval force.\n\nIn the mean time, the Carthaginian soldiery having Barcas sent thown a disposition to mutiny, the senate sent over Hamilcar Barcas, father of the famous Hannibal, to Sicily. He received a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a> blanchie from the senate to act as he thought proper; and by his excellent conduct and resolution, showed himself the greatest general of his age. He defended Eryx, which he had taken by surprize, with such vigour, that the Romans would never have been able to make themselves masters of it, had they not fitted out a new fleet at the expense of private citizens, which, having utterly defeated that of the Carthaginians, Hamilcar, notwithstanding all his valour, was obliged to yield up the place which he had so long and so bravely defended. The following articles of a peace were immediately drawn up between the two commanders. 1. The Carthaginians shall evacuate all the places which they have in Sicily, and entirely quit that island. 2. They shall, in 20 years, pay the Romans, at equal payments every year, 2200 talents of silver, that is, 437,250l <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>. 3. They shall restore the Roman captives and deserters without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RANSOM\">ransom</a>, and redeem their own prisoners with money. 4. They shall not make war upon Hiero king of Syracuse, or his allies. These articles being agreed to, Hamilcar surrendered Eryx upon condition that all his soldiers should march out with him, upon his paying for each of them 18 Roman denarii. Hostages were given on both sides, and deputies were sent to Rome to procure a ratification of the treaty by the senate. After the senators had thoroughly informed themselves of the state of affairs, two more articles were added, viz. 1. That 1000 talents should be paid immediately, and the 2200 in the space of 10 years at equal payments. 2. That the Carthaginians should quit all the little islands about Italy and Sicily, and never more come near them with ships of war, or raise mercenaries in those places. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">Necessity</a> obliged Hamilcar to consent to these terms; but he returned to Carthage with a hatred to the Romans, which he did not even suffer to die with him, but transmitted to his son the great Hannibal.\n\nThe Carthaginians were no soon got out of this bloody and expensive war, than they found themselves engaged in another, which was like to have proved fatal to them. It is called by ancient historians the Libyan war, or the war with the mercenaries. The principal occasion of it was, that when Hamilcar returned to Carthage, he found the republic so much impoverished, that, far from being able to give these troops the large fees and rewards promised them, it could not pay them their arrears. He had committed the care of transporting them to one Gisco, who, being an officer of great penetration, as though he had foreseen what would happen, did not ship them off all at once, but in small and separate parties, that those who came first might be paid off and sent home before the arrival of the rest. The Carthaginians at home, however, did not act with the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>. As the state was almost entirely exhausted by the late war, and the immense sum of money, in consequence of the peace, paid to the Romans, they judged it would be a laudable action to save something to the public. They did not therefore pay off the mercenaries in proportion as they arrived, thinking it more proper to wait till they all came together, with a view of obtaining some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMISSION\">remission</a> of their arrears. But being soon made sensible of their wrong conduct on this occasion, by the frequent disorders these barbarians committed in the city, they with some difficulty prevailed upon the officers to take up their quarters at Sicca, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTON\">canton</a> their troops in that neighbourhood. To induce them to this, however, they gave them a sum of money for their present subsistence, and promised to comply with their pretensions when the remainder of their troops arrived from Sicily. Here, being wholly immersed in idleness, to which they had long been strangers, a neglect of discipline ensued, and of course a petulant and licentious spirit immediately took place. They were now determined not to acquiesce in receiving their bare pay, but to insist upon the rewards Hamilcar had promised them, and even to compel the state of Carthage to comply with their demands by force of arms. The senate being informed of the imprudent mutinous disposition of the soldiery, dispatched Hannibal, one of the suffetes, to pacify them. Upon his arrival at Sicca, he expatiated largely upon the poverty of the state, and the heavy taxes with which the citizens of Carthage were loaded; and therefore, instead of answering their high expectations, he desired them to be satisfied with receiving part of their pay, and remit the remainder to serve the pressing exigencies of the republic. The mercenaries being highly provoked, that neither Hamilcar, nor any other of the principal officers who commanded them in Sicily, and were the best judges of their merit, made their appearance on this occasion, but only Hannibal, a person utterly unknown, and above all others utterly disagreeable to them, immediately had recourse to arms. Assembling therefore in a body, to the number of 20,000, they advanced to Tunis, and immediately encamped before that city.\n\nThe Carthaginians being greatly alarmed at the approach of so formidable a body to Tunis, made large concessions to the mercenaries, in order to bring them back to their duty; but, far from being softened, they grew more insolent upon these concessions, taking\nCarthage, taking them for the effects of fear; and therefore were altogether averse to thoughts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>. The Carthaginians, making a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of necessity, showed a disposition to satisfy them in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, and agreed to refer themselves to the opinion of some general in Sicily, which they had all along desired; leaving the choice of such commander entirely to them. Gisco was accordingly pitched upon to mediate this affair, the mercenaries believing Hamilcar to have been a principal cause of the ill treatment they met with, since he never appeared among them, and, according to the general opinion, had voluntarily resigned his commission. Gisco soon arrived at Tunis with money to pay the troops; and after conferring with the officers of the several nations apart, he harangued them in such a manner, that a treaty was upon the point of being concluded, when Spendius and Mathos, two of the principal mutineers, occasioned a tumult in every part of the camp. Spendius was by nation a Campanian, who had been a slave at Rome, and had fled to the Carthaginians. The apprehensions he was under of being delivered to his old master, by whom he was sure to be hanged or crucified, prompted him to break off the accommodation. Mathos was an African, and free born; but as he had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> in raising the rebellion, and was well acquainted with the implacable disposition of the Carthaginians, he knew that a peace must infallibly prove his ruin. He therefore joined with Spendius, and intimated to the Africans the danger of concluding a treaty at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a>, which could not but leave them singly exposed to the rage of the Carthaginians. This so incensed the Africans, who were much more numerous than the troops of any other nation, that they immediately assembled in a tumultuous manner. The foreigners soon joined them, being inspired by Spendius with an equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of fury. Nothing was now to be heard but the most horrid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a> and imprecations against Gisco and the Carthaginians. Whoever offered to make any remonstrance, or lend an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> to temperate counsels, was stoned to death by the enraged multitude. Nay, many persons lost their lives barely for attempting to speak, before it could be known whether they were in the interest of Spendius or the Carthaginians.\n\nIn the midst of these commotions, Gisco behaved with great firmness and intrepidity. He left no methods untried to soften the officers and calm the minds of the soldiery; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a> of sedition was now so strong, that there was no possibility of keeping it within bounds. They therefore seized upon the military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>, dividing the money among themselves in part of their arrears, put the person of Gisco under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARREST\">arrest</a>, and treated him as well as his attendants with the utmost indignity. Mathos and Spendius, to destroy the remotest hopes of an accommodation with Carthage, applauded the courage and resolution of their men, loaded the unhappy Gisco and his followers with irons, and formally declared war against the Carthaginians. All the cities of Africa, to whom they had sent deputies to exhort them to recover their liberty, soon came over to them, except Utica and Hippo Diarrhytus. By this means their army being greatly increased, they divided it into two parts, with one of which they moved towards Utica, whilst the other marched to Hippo, in order to besiege both places. The Carthaginians, in the meantime, found themselves ready to link under the pressure of their misfortunes. After they had been harassed 24 years by a most cruel and destructive foreign war, they entertained some hopes of enjoying repose. The citizens of Carthage drew their particular subsistence from the rents or revenues of their lands, and the public expenses from the tribute paid from Africa; all which they were not only deprived of at once, but, what was worse, had it directly turned against them. They were destitute of arms and forces either by sea or land; had made no preparations for the sustaining of a siege, or the equipping of a fleet. They suffered all the calamities incident to the most furious civil war; and, to complete their misery, had not the least prospect of receiving assistance from any foreign friend or ally. Notwithstanding their deplorable situation, however, they did not despair, but pursued all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> necessary to put themselves into a posture of defense. Hannibal was appointed commander in chief of all their forces; and the most strenuous efforts were made, not only to repel all the attempts of the mutineers, but even to reduce them by force of arms.\n\nIn the mean time Mathos and Spendius laid siege to Utica and Hippo Diarrhytus at once; but as they were carried on by detachments drawn from the army for that purpose, they remained with the main body of their forces at Tunis, and thereby cut off all communication between Carthage and the continent of Africa. By this means the capital was kept in a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCKADE\">blockade</a>. The Africans likewise harassed them by perpetual alarms, advancing to the very walls of Carthage by day as well as by night, and treating with the utmost cruelty every Carthaginian that fell into their hands.\n\nHannibal was despatched to the relief of Utica with a good body of forces, 100 elephants, and a large train of battering engines. Having taken a view of the enemy, he immediately attacked their intrenchments, and after an obstinate dispute forced them. The mercenaries lost a vast number of men; and consequently the advantages gained by Hannibal were so great, that they might have proved decisive, had he made a proper use of them. But becoming secure at first, his victory, and his troops being everywhere defeated, their duty, the mercenaries, having rallied their forces, fell upon him, cut off many of his men, forced the rest to fly into the town, retook and plundered the camp, and seized all the provisions, military stores, &c., brought to the relief of the besieged. Nor was this the only instance of Hannibal's military incapacity. Notwithstanding he lay encamped in the most advantageous manner near a town called Gara, at which place he twice overthrew the enemy, and had it in his power to have totally ruined them, he yet neglected to improve those advantages, and even suffered the mercenaries to possess themselves of the isthmus, which joined the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> on which Carthage stood, to the continent of Africa.\n\nThese repeated mistakes induced the Carthaginians once more to place Hamilcar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARCA\">Barca</a> at the head of pointed to their forces. He marched against the enemy with command 10,000 men, horse, and foot, being all the troops the Carthaginians.\nCarthage. Carthaginians could then assemble for their defense; a full proof of the low state to which they were at that time reduced. As Mathos, after he had posted himself of the isthmus, had posted proper detachments in two places on two hills facing the continent, and guarded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> over the Bagrada, which through Hanno's neglect he had taken, Hamilcar saw little probability of engaging him upon equal terms, or indeed of coming at him. Observing, however, that on the blowing of certain winds, the mouth of the river was choked up with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, so as to become passable, though with no small difficulty, as long as these winds continued; he halted for some time at the river's mouth, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> his design to any person. As soon as the wind favoured his intended project, he passed the river privately by night, and immediately after his passage, he drew up the troops in order of battle; and advancing into the plain where his elephants were capable of acting, moved towards Mathos who was posted at the village near the bridge.\n\nThis daring action greatly surprised and intimidated the Africans. However, Spendius receiving intelligence of the enemy's motions, drew a body of 10,000 men out of Mathos's camp, with which he attended Hamilcar on one side, and ordered 15,000 from Utica to observe him on the other, thinking by this means to surround the Carthaginians, and cut them all off at one stroke. By feigning a retreat, Hamilcar found means to engage them at a disadvantage, and gave them a total overthrow, with the loss of 6000 killed and 2000 taken prisoners. The rest fled, some to the town at the bridge, and others to the camp at Utica. He did not give them time to recover from their defeat, but pursued them to the town near the bridge before mentioned; which he entered without opposition, the mercenaries flying in great confusion to Tunis; and upon this many towns submitted of their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a> to the Carthaginians, whilst others were reduced by force.\n\nNotwithstanding these disasters, Mathos pushed on the siege of Hippo with great vigour, and appointed Spendius and Autaritus, commanders of the Gauls, with a strong body, to observe the motions of Hamilcar. These two commanders, therefore, at the head of a choice detachment of 6000 men drawn out of the camp at Tunis, and 2000 Gallic horse, attended the Carthaginian general, approaching him as near as they could with safety, and keeping close to the skirts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>. At last Spendius, having received a strong reinforcement of Africans and Numidians, and posting himself of all the heights surrounding the plain in which Hamilcar lay encamped, resolved not to let slip so favourable an opportunity of attacking him. Had a battle now ensued, Hamilcar and his army must in all probability have been cut off; but by the defection of one Naravasius a young Numidian nobleman, with 2000 men, he found himself enabled to offer his enemies battle. The fight was obstinate and bloody; but at last the mercenaries were entirely overthrown, with the loss of 10,000 men killed and 4000 taken prisoners. All the prisoners that were willing to enlist in the Carthaginian service Hamilcar received among his troops, supplying them with the arms of the soldiers who had fallen in the engagement. To the rest he gave full liberty to go where they pleased, upon condition that they should never for the future bear arms against the Carthaginians; informing them at the same time, however, that as many violators of this agreement as fell into his hands must expect to find no mercy.\n\nMathos and his associates, fearing that this affected them to death all the Carthaginian prisoners were put to death; and when Hamilcar sent to demand the remains of his countrymen, he received for answer, that whoever presumed hereafter to come upon that errand, should meet with Gifco's fate: after which they came to a resolution to treat with the same barbarity all such Carthaginians as should fall into their hands. In return for this enormity, Hamilcar threw all the prisoners that fell into his hands to be devoured by wild beasts; being convinced that compassion served only to make his enemies more fierce and untractable.\n\nThe war was now carried on generally to the advantage of the Carthaginians; nevertheless, the malecontents still found themselves in a capacity to take the field with an army of 50,000 men. They watched Hamilcar's motions, but kept on the hills, carefully avoiding to come down into the plains, on account of the Numidian horse and Carthaginian elephants. Hamilcar, being much superior in skill to any of their generals, at last shut them up in a pelt, so situated, that it was impossible to get out of it. Here he kept them strictly besieged; and the mercenaries, not daring to venture a battle, began to fortify their camp, and surround it with ditches and intrenchments. They were soon pressed by famine so forcibly, that they were obliged to eat one another: but they were driven desperate by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of their guilt, and therefore did not desire any terms of accommodation. At last being reduced to the utmost extremity of misery, they insisted that Spendius, Autaritus, and Zarxas, their leaders, should in person have a conference with Hamilcar, and make proposals to him. Peace was accordingly concluded upon the following terms, viz. That ten of the ringleaders of the malecontents should be left entirely to the mercy of the Carthaginians, and that the troops should all be disarmed, every man retiring only in a single coat. The treaty was no sooner concluded, than Hamilcar, by virtue of the first article, seized upon the negotiators themselves; and the army being informed that their chiefs were under arrest, had immediately recourse to arms, as suspecting they were betrayed; but Hamilcar, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> out his army in order of battle, surrounded them, and either cut them to pieces, or trod them to death with his elephants. The number of wretches who perished on this occasion amounted to above 40,000.\n\nAfter the destruction of the army, Hamilcar invested Tunis, whither Mathos had retired with all his remaining forces. Hamilcar had another general, named Hannibal, joined in the command with him. Hannibal's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> was on the road leading to Carthage, and Hamilcar's on the opposite side. The army was no sooner encamped, than Hamilcar caused Spendius, and the rest of the prisoners, to be led out in\nin the view of the besieged, and crucified near the walls. Mathos, however, observing that Hannibal did not keep so good a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> as he ought to have done, made a sally, attacked his quarters, killed many of his men, took several prisoners, among whom was Hannibal himself, and plundered his camp. Taking the body of Spendius from the cross, Mathos immediately substituted Hannibal in its room; and 30 Carthaginian prisoners of distinction were crucified around him.\n\nUpon this disaster, Hamilcar immediately decamped, and posted himself along the sea coast, near the mouth of the river Bagrada.\n\nThe senate, though greatly terrified by this unexpected blow, omitted no means necessary for their preservation. They sent 30 senators, with Hannibal at their head, to consult with Hamilcar about the proper measures for putting an end to this unnatural war, conjuring, in the most pressing manner, Hannibal to be reconciled to Hamilcar, and to sacrifice his private resentment to the public benefit. This, with some difficulty, was effected; and the two generals came to a full resolution to act in concert for the good of the public. The senate at the same time, ordered all the youth capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> arms to be pressed into the service: by which means a strong reinforcement being sent to Hamilcar, he soon found himself in a condition to act offensively. He now defeated the enemy in all encounters, drew Mathos into frequent ambuscades, and gave him one notable overthrow near Leptis. This reduced the rebels to the necessity of hazarding a decisive battle, which proved fatal to them. The mercenaries fled almost at the first onset; most of their army fell in the field of battle, and in the pursuit. Mathos, with a few, escaped to a neighboring town, where he was taken alive, carried to Carthage, and executed; and then by the reduction of the revolted cities an end was put to this war, which, from the excesses of cruelty committed in it, according to Polybius, went among the Greeks by the name of the inexpiable war.\n\nDuring the Libyan war, the Romans, upon some absurd pretences, wrested the island of Sardinia from the Carthaginians; which the latter not being able to resist, were obliged to submit to. Hamilcar finding his country not in a condition to enter into an immediate war with Rome, formed a scheme to put it on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with that haughty republic. This was by making an entire conquest of Spain, by which means the Carthaginians might have troops capable of coping with the Romans. In order to facilitate the execution of this scheme, he inspired both his son-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> Asdrubal, and his son Hannibal, with an implacable aversion to the Romans, as the great opposers of his country's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>. Having completed all the necessary preparations, Hamilcar, after having greatly enlarged the Carthaginian dominions in Africa, entered Spain, where he commanded nine years, during which time he subdued many warlike nations, and amassed an immense quantity of treasure, which he distributed partly amongst his troops, and partly amongst the great men at Carthage; by which means he supported his interests with these two powerful bodies. At last, he was killed in a battle, and was succeeded by his son-in-law Asdrubal. This general fully answered the expectations of his countrymen; greatly enlarged their dominions in Spain; and built the city of New Carthage, Carthage now Cartagena. He made such progress in his conquests, that the Romans began to grow jealous. They did not, however, choose at present to come to an open rupture, on account of the apprehensions they were under of an invasion from the Gauls. They judged it most proper, therefore, to have recourse to milder methods; and prevailed upon Asdrubal to conclude a new treaty with them. The articles of it were,\n\n1. That the Carthaginians should not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> the Iberus.\n2. That the Saguntines, a colony of Zacynthians, and a city situated between the Iberus and that part of Spain subject to the Carthaginians, as well as the other Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> there, should enjoy their ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> and privileges.\n\nAsdrubal, after having governed the Carthaginian dominions in Spain for eight years, was treacherously murdered by a Gaul, whose master he had put to death. Three years before this happened, he had written to Carthage, to desire that young Hannibal, then twenty-two years of age, might be sent to him. This request was complied with, notwithstanding the opposition of Hannibal; and from the first arrival of the young man in the camp, he became the darling of the whole army. The great resemblance he bore to Hamilcar rendered him extremely agreeable to the troops. Every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> and qualification he seemed to possess, that contribute towards forming a great man. After the death of Asdrubal, he was saluted general by the army with the highest demonstrations of joy. He immediately put himself in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>; and in the first campaign conquered the Olcades, a nation seated near the Iberus. The next year he subdued the Vaccei, another nation in that neighborhood. Soon after, the Carthageni, one of the most powerful nations in Spain, declared against the Carthaginians. Their army consisted of 100,000 men, with which they proposed to attack Hannibal on his return from the Vaccei; but by a stratagem they were utterly defeated, and the whole nation obliged to submit.\n\nNothing now remained to oppose the progress of the Carthaginian arms but the city of Saguntum. Hannibal, however, for some time, did not think proper to come to a rupture with the Romans by attacking that place. At last he found means to embroil some of the neighboring cantons, especially the Turdetani, or, as Appian calls them, the Torbolites, with Saguntum, the Saguntines, and thus furnished himself with a pretence to attack their city. Upon the commencement of the siege, the Roman senate despatched two ambassadors to Hannibal, with orders to proceed to Carthage in case the general refused to give them satisfaction. They were scarce landed, when Hannibal, who was carrying on the siege of Saguntum with great vigour, sent them word that he had something else to do than to give audience to ambassadors. At last, however, he admitted them; and, in answer to their remonstrances, told them, that the Saguntines had drawn their misfortunes upon themselves, by committing hostilities against the allies of Carthage; and at the same time desired the deputies, if they had any complaints to make of them, to carry them to the senate of Carthage. On their arrival in that capital, they demanded that Hannibal might be delivered up to the Romans to be punished according to his deserts;\nand this not being complied with, war was immediately declared between the two nations.\n\nThe Saguntines are said to have defended themselves for eight months with incredible bravery. At last, however, the city was taken, and the inhabitants were treated with the utmost cruelty. After this conquest, Hannibal put his African troops into winter quarters at New Carthage; but in order to gain their affection, he permitted the Spaniards to retire to their respective homes.\n\nThe next campaign, having taken the necessary measures for securing Africa and Spain, he passed the Iberus, subdued all the nations betwixt that river and the Pyrenees, appointed Hanno commander of all the new conquered district, and immediately began his march for Italy. Upon mustering his forces, after they had been weakened by sieges, defection, mortality, and a detachment of 10,000 foot and 1000 horse, left with Hanno to support him in his new post, he found them to amount to 50,000 foot and 9000 horse, all veteran troops, and the best in the world. As they had left their heavy baggage with Hanno, and were all light-armed, Hannibal easily crossed the Pyrenees; passed by Rulcino, a frontier town of the Gauls, and arrived on the banks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RHONE\">Rhone</a> without opposition. This river he passed, notwithstanding some opposition from the Gauls; and was for some time in doubt whether he should advance to engage the Romans, who, under Scipio, were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> their march that way, or continue his march for Italy. But to the latter he was soon determined by the arrival of Maglius, prince of the Boii, who brought rich presents with him, and offered to conduct the Carthaginian army over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a>. Nothing could have happened more favourable to Hannibal's affairs than the arrival of this prince, since there was no room to doubt the sincerity of his intentions. For the Boii bore an implacable enmity to the Romans, and had even come to an open rupture with them, upon the first news that Italy was threatened with an invasion from the Carthaginians.\n\nIt is not known with certainty where Hannibal began to ascend the Alps. As soon as he began his march, the petty kings of the country assembled their forces in great numbers; and taking possession of the eminences over which the Carthaginians must necessarily pass, they continued harassing them, and were no sooner driven from one eminence than they seized on another, disputing every foot of land with the enemy, and destroying great numbers of them by the advantage they had of the ground. Hannibal, however, having found means to possess himself of an advantageous post, defeated and dispersed the enemy; and soon after took their capital city, where he found the prisoners, horses, &c. that had before fallen into the hands of the enemy, and likewise corn sufficient to serve the army for three days. At last, after a most fatiguing march of nine days, he arrived at the top of the mountains. Here he encamped, and halted two days, to give his wearied troops some repose, and to wait for the stragglers. As the snow had lately fallen in great plenty, and covered the ground, this sight terrified the Africans and Spaniards, who were much affected with the cold. In order, therefore, to encourage them, the Carthaginian general led them to the top of the highest rock on the side of Italy, and thence gave them a view of the large and fruitful plains of Insubria, acquainting them that the Gauls, whose country they saw, were ready to join them. He also pointed out to them the place whereabout Rome stood, telling them, that by climbing the Alps they had scaled the walls of that rich metropolis; and having thus animated his troops, he decamped, and began to defend the mountains. The difficulties they met with in their descent were much greater than those that had occurred while they ascended. They had indeed no enemy to contend with, except some scattered parties that came to fleal rather than to fight; but the deep snows, the mountains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>, craggy rocks, and frightful precipices, proved more terrible than any enemy. After they had for some days marched through narrow, steep, and slippery ways, they came at last to a place which neither elephants, horses, nor men, could pass. The way which lay between two precipices was exceeding narrow; and the declivity, which was very steep, had become more dangerous by the falling away of the earth. Here the guides stopped; and the whole army being terrified, Hannibal proposed at first to march round about, and attempt some other way: but all places round him being covered with snow, he found himself reduced to the necessity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> a way into the rock itself, through which his men, horses, and elephants, might descend. This work was accomplished with incredible labour; and then Hannibal, having spent nine days in ascending, and six in descending, the Alps, gained at length Insubria; and, notwithstanding all the difficulties he had met with by the way, entered the country with all the boldness of a conqueror.\n\nHannibal, on his entry into Insubria, reviewed his army; when he found that of the 50,000 foot, with whom he set out from New Carthage five months and fifteen days before, he had now but 20,000, and that his 9000 horse were reduced to 6000. His first care, after he entered Italy, was to refresh his troops; who after so long a march, and such inexpressible hardships, looked like as many skeletons raised from the dead, or savages born in a desert. He did not, however, suffer them to languish long in idleness; but, joining the Insubrians, who were at war with the Taurinians, laid siege to Taurinum, the only city in the country, and in three days time became master of it, putting all who resisted to the sword. This struck the neighbouring barbarians with such terror, that of their own accord they submitted to the conqueror, and supplied his army with all sorts of provisions.\n\nScipio, the Roman general, in the mean time, who had gone in quest of Hannibal on the banks of the Rhone, was surprised to find his antagonist had crossed the Alps and entered Italy. He therefore returned with the utmost expedition. An engagement ensued near the river Ticinus, in which the Romans were defeated. The immediate consequence was, that Scipio repassed that river, and Hannibal continued his march to the banks of the Po. Here he stayed two days, before he could cross that river over a bridge of boats. He then sent Mago in pursuit of the enemy, who having rallied their scattered forces, and repassed the Po, were encamped at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACENTIA\">Placentia</a>. Afterwards having concluded a treaty with several of the Gallic cantons,\nCarthage cantons, he joined his brother with the rest of the army, and again offered battle to the Romans; but this they thought proper to decline; and at last the consul, being intimidated by the defection of a body of Gauls, abandoned his camp, passed the Trebia, and posted himself on an eminence near that river. Here he drew <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> round his camp, and waited the arrival of his colleague with the forces from Sicily.\n\nHannibal being apprised of the consul's departure, sent out the Numidian horse to harass him on his march; himself moving with the main body to support them in case of need. The Numidians arriving before the rear of the Roman army had quite passed the Trebia, put to the sword or made prisoners all the stragglers they found there. Soon after, Hannibal coming up, encamped in sight of the Roman army on the opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>. Here having learned the character of the consul Sempronius lately arrived, he soon brought him to an engagement, and entirely defeated him. Ten thousand of the enemy retired to Placentia; but the rest were either killed or taken prisoners. The Carthaginians pursued the flying Romans as far as the Trebia, but did not think proper to repass that river on account of the excessive cold.\n\nHannibal, after this action upon the Trebia, ordered the Numidians, Celtiberians, and Lusitanians, to make incursions into the Roman territories, where they committed great devastations. During his state of inaction, he endeavoured to win the affections of the Gauls, and likewise of the allies of the Romans; declaring to the Gallic and Italian prisoners, that he had no intention of making war upon them, being determined to restore them to their liberty, and protect them against the Romans; and to confirm them in their good opinion of him, he dismissed them all without ransom.\n\nNext year having crossed the Apennines, and penetrated into Etruria, Hannibal received intelligence that the new consul Flamininus lay encamped with the Roman army under the walls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-AREZZO\">Arezzo</a>. Having learned the true character of this general, that he was of a haughty, fierce, and rash disposition, he doubted not of being soon able to bring him to a battle. To inflame the impetuous spirit of Flaminius, the Carthaginian general took the road to Rome, and, leaving the Roman army behind him, destroyed all the country through which he passed with fire and sword; and as that part of Italy abounded with all the elegancies as well as necessaries of life, the Romans and their allies suffered an incredible loss on this occasion. The rash consul was inflamed with the utmost rage, on seeing the ravages committed by the Carthaginians; and therefore immediately approached them with great temerity, as if certain of victory. Hannibal in the mean time kept on, still advancing towards Rome, having Crotona on the left hand, and the lake Trasimene on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>; and at last, having drawn Flaminius into an ambuscade, entirely defeated him. The general himself, with 15,000 of his men, fell on the field of battle. A great number were likewise taken prisoners; and a body of 6,000 men, who had fled to a town in Etruria, surrendered to Maharbal the next day. Hannibal lost only 1,500 men on this occasion, most of whom were Gauls; though great numbers, both of his soldiers and of the Romans, died of their wounds. Carthage Being soon after informed that the consul Servilius had detached a body of 4,000, or, according to Apian, 8,000 horse from Ariminum, to reinforce his colleague detachment in Etruria, Hannibal sent out Maharbal, with all the cut cavalry, and some of the infantry, to attack him. Pieces or The Roman detachment consisted of chosen men, and was commanded by Centenius a patrician. Maharbal had the good fortune to meet with him, and after a short dispute entirely defeated him. Two thousand of the Romans were laid dead on the spot; the rest, retiring to a neighbouring eminence, were surrounded by Maharbal's forces, and obliged next day to surrender at discretion; and this disaster, happening within a few days after the defeat at the lake Trasimene, almost gave the finishing stroke to the Roman affairs.\n\nThe Carthaginian army was now so much troubled with a scurful disorder, owing to the unwholesome encampments they had been obliged to make, and the miseries they had passed through, that Hannibal found it absolutely necessary to remove them for some time in the territory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADRIA\">Adria</a>, a most pleasant and fertile country. In his various engagements with the Romans, he had taken a great number of their arms, with which he now armed his men after the Roman manner. Being now likewise master of that part of the country bordering on the sea, he found means to send an express to Carthage with the news of the glorious progress of his arms. The citizens received this news with the most joyful acclamations, at the same time coming to a resolution to reinforce their armies both in Italy and Spain, with a proper number of troops.\n\nThe Romans being now in the utmost consternation, named a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DICTATOR\">dictator</a>, as was their custom in times of great danger. The person they chose to this office was Fabius Maximus, surnamed Verrucosus; a man as cool and cautious as Sempronius and Flaminius were warm and impetuous. He set out with a design not to engage Hannibal, but only to watch his motions and cut off his provisions, which he knew was the most proper way to destroy him in a country so far from his own. Accordingly he followed him through Umbria and Picenum, into the territory of Adria, and then through the territories of the Marrucini, and Paeliati, into Apulia. When the enemy marched, he followed them; when they encamped, he did the same; but for the most part on eminences, and at some distance from their camp, watching all their motions, cutting off their stragglers, and keeping them in a continual alarm. This cautious method of proceeding greatly distressed the Carthaginians, but at the same time raised discontent in his own army. But neither these discontented, nor the ravages committed by Hannibal, could prevail upon Fabius to alter his measures. The former, therefore, entered Campania, one of the finest countries of Italy. The ravages he committed there raised such complaints in the Roman army, that the dictator, for fear of irritating his soldiers, was obliged to pretend a desire of coming to an engagement. Accordingly he followed Hannibal with more expedition than usual; but at the same time avoided, under various pretences, an engagement with more care than the enemy sought it. Hannibal finding he could not by any means bring the dictator to a battle, resolved\nresolved to quit Campania, which he found abounding more with fruit and wine than corn, and to return to Samnium through the pass called Etruban. Fabius concluding from his march that this was his design, got there before him, and encamped on Mount Callicula, which commanded the pass, after having placed several bodies in all the avenues leading to it.\n\nHannibal was for some time at a loss what to do; but at last contrived the following stratagem, which Fabius could not foresee nor guard against. Being encamped at the foot of Mount Callicula, he ordered Asdrubal to pick out of the cattle taken in the country 2000 of the strongest and nimblest oxen, to tie faggots to their horns, and to have them and the herdsmen ready without the camp. After supper, when all was quiet, the cattle were brought in good order to the hill, where Fabius had placed some Roman parties in ambush to stop up the pass. Upon a signal given, the faggots on the horns of the oxen were set on fire; and the herdsmen, supported by some battalions armed with small javelins, drove them on quietly. The Romans seeing the light of the fires, imagined that the Carthaginians were marching by torch light. However, Fabius kept close in his camp, depending on the troops he had placed in ambush; but when the oxen, feeling the fire on their heads, began to run up and down the hills, the Romans in ambush thinking themselves surrounded on all sides, and climbing the ways where they saw least light, returned to their camp, leaving the pass open to Hannibal. Fabius, though rallied by his soldiers for being thus overreached by the Carthaginian, still continued to pursue the same plan, marched directly after Hannibal, and encamped on some eminences near him.\n\nSoon after this, the dictator was recalled to Rome; and as Hannibal, notwithstanding the terrible ravages he had committed, had all along spared the lands of Fabius, the latter was suspected of holding a secret correspondence with the enemy. In his absence, Minucius, the general of the horse, gained some advantages, which greatly tended to increase the discontent with the dictator, insomuch that before his return Minucius was put upon an equal footing with himself. The general of the horse proposed that each should command his day; but the dictator chose rather to divide the army, hoping by that means to save at least a part of it. Hannibal soon found means to draw Minucius to an engagement, and by his masterly skill in laying ambuscades, the Roman general was surrounded on every side, and would have been cut off with all his troops, had not Fabius hastened to his assistance, and relieved him. Then the two armies uniting, advanced in good order to renew the fight; but Hannibal, not caring to venture a second action, sounded a retreat, and retired to his camp; and Minucius, being ashamed of his rashness, resigned the command of the army to Fabius.\n\nThe year following, the Romans augmented their army to 87,000 men, horse and foot, under the command of Emilius Paulus and Terentius Varro, the consuls for the year; and Hannibal being reduced to the greatest straits for want of provisions, resolved to leave Samnium, and penetrate into the heart of Apulia. Accordingly he decamped in the night; and by leaving fires <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>, and tents standing in his camp, made the Romans believe for some time that his retreat was only feigned. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> was discovered, Emilius was against pursuing him; but in this he was seconded by few besides Servilius, one of the consuls of the preceding year; Terentius and all the other officers being obstinately bent on pursuing the enemy. They accordingly overtook them at Cannae, till this time an obscure village in Apulia. A battle ensued at this place, as memorable as any mentioned in history; in which the Romans, though almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> in number to the Carthaginians, were put to flight with most terrible slaughter; at least 45,000 of them being left dead on the field of battle, and 10,000 taken prisoners in the action or pursuit. The night was spent in Hannibal's camp in feasting and rejoicing, and next day in stripping the dead bodies of the unhappy Romans; after which the victorious general invested their two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPS\">camps</a>, where he found 4000 men.\n\nThe immediate consequence of this victory, as Hannibal had foreseen, was a disposition of that part of Italy called the Old Province, Magna Grecia, Tarentum, and part of the territory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPUA\">Capua</a>, to submit to him. The neighbouring provinces likewise discovered an inclination to shake off the Roman yoke, but wanted first to see whether Hannibal was able to protect them. His first march was into Samnium, being informed that the Hirpini and other neighbouring nations were disposed to enter into an alliance with the Carthaginians. He advanced to Compaf, which opened its gates to him. In this place he left his heavy baggage, as well as the immense plunder he had acquired. After which he ordered his brother Mago, with a body of troops destined for that purpose, to possess himself of all the fortresses in Campania, the most delicious province of Italy. The humanity Hannibal had all along shown the Italian prisoners, as well as the fame of the complete victory he had lately obtained, wrought so powerfully upon the Lucani, Bruttii, and Apuliens, that they expressed an eager desire of being taken under his protection. Nay, even the Campanians themselves, a nation more obliged to the Romans than any in Italy, except the Latins, discovered an inclination to abandon their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> friends. Of this the Carthaginian general receiving intelligence, he bent his march towards Capua, not doubting but that, by means of the popular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a> there, he should easily make himself master of it; which accordingly happened. Soon after this place had made its submission, many cities of the Bruttii opened their gates to Hannibal, who ordered his brother Mago to take possession of them. Mago was then despatched to Carthage, with the important news of the victory at Cannae, and the consequences attending it. Upon his arrival there, he acquainted the senate, that Hannibal had defeated six Roman generals, four of whom were consuls, one dictator, and the other general of horse to the dictator: that he had engaged six consular armies, killed two consuls, wounded one, and driven another out of the field, with scarce 50 men to attend him: that he had routed the general of the horse, who was of equal power with the consuls; and that the dictator was esteemed the only general fit to command an army, merely because he had not the courage to engage him: and as a demonstrative proof of what he advanced, he produced, according to some authors,\nauthors, three bushels and a half of gold rings, taken from knights and senators who had been killed in the various engagements.\n\nHitherto we have seen Hannibal surprisingly victorious; and, indeed, if we consider what he had already done, we shall find his exploits superior to those of any other general, either ancient or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a>. Other commanders have been celebrated for victories gained over barbarous and uncivilized nations. Alexander the Great invaded and overran the empire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>; but that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> was then sunk in sloth and effeminacy, so as to be an easy conquest; but had that great commander turned his arms against the western nations, who were of a more martial disposition, it is more than probable he had not conquered so easily.\n\nHannibal, on the other hand, lived at a time when the Romans were not only the most powerful, but the most warlike nation in the whole world. That nation he attacked with an army of only 26,000 men, without resources either for recruits, money, or provisions, except what he could procure in the enemy's country. With these he had for three years resisted the Roman armies; which had been hitherto invincible by all other nations. Their armies had been commanded by generals of different tempers, dispositions, and abilities: the losses they sustained are by the Roman writers imputed to the faults of the generals themselves; but experience has abundantly shown, that these commanders, with all their faults, were able to conquer the most warlike nations, when commanded by another than Hannibal. In the battles fought with the Romans he had destroyed 200,000 of their men, and taken 50,000 prisoners; yet from the time of the battle of Cannae, the affairs of this great man totally declined. The reason of this is, by the Roman historians, said to be, that when he put his army into winter quarters in Capua, he so enervated himself and his army by debaucheries in that place, that he became no longer capable of coping with the Roman forces. But this seems by no means to have been the case; for the Roman historians themselves own, that, after the battle of Cannae, he gave their armies many and terrible defeats, and took a great number of towns in their flight.\n\nThe true reason of that reverse of fortune which Hannibal now experienced, was his not having sufficient resources for recruiting his army. On the first news, indeed, of his success at Carthage, a body of 4000 Numidian cavalry, 40 elephants, and 1000 talents of silver, were granted by the senate. A large detachment of Spanish forces was also appointed to follow them; and that these last might be ready in due time, Mago set out immediately for Spain to raise 20,000 foot and 4000 horse there. Had this ample supply been sent with proper expedition, it is by no means probable that the Romans would have had any occasion to reflect upon Hannibal's conduct at Capua. That general would undoubtedly have obliged the haughty republic to submit to the superior force of his arms the next campaign. But, notwithstanding the influence of the Barcinean faction at Carthage, Hannibal and his adherents found means not only to retard the march of the supplies intended, but even to diminish their number. Mago, through the artifices of that infatuated party, could obtain an order for only 12,000 foot and 2,500 horse; and even with this insufficient body of troops he was sent into Spain. Hannibal being thus deserted by his country, found himself obliged to act on the defensive; his army amounting to no more now than 26,000 foot and 9000 horse. But though obliged to act in this manner, he was only hindered from conquering; the utmost efforts of the whole Roman power, not being able to drive this small army out of Italy for more than 14 years.\n\nThe Romans, though greatly reduced, were not yet exhausted. They were able still to send two consuls, taken by full armies into the field, fully recruited and in good order; and as neither the Gauls nor Italians were natural allies of the Carthaginians, they did not fail to abandon them on the first reverse of fortune. After the Romans had recovered from the consternation into which they were thrown by the defeat at Cannae, they chose a dictator, and recalled Marcellus, the conqueror of Syracuse, from Sicily. All the young Romans, above 17 years of age, of what rank soever, were obliged to enlist themselves; as were also those who had already served their legal time. By this means four legions and 10,000 horse were soon raised in the city. The allies of Rome, the colonies, and the municipia, furnished their contingence as usual. To these were added 8000 of the youngest and strongest slaves in the city. The republic purchased them of their masters, but did not oblige them to serve without their own consent, which they gave, by answering \"Volo\" (\"I am willing\"); whence they were called volones, to distinguish them from the other troops. As the Romans, after the loss of so many battles, had no swords, darts, or bucklers, left in their magazines, the volones were supplied with the arms which had been formerly taken from the enemy, and hung up in the public temples and porticoes. The finances of Rome were no less exhausted: but this defect was supplied by the liberality of her citizens. The senators showing the example, were followed first by the knights, and afterwards by all the tribes; who stripping themselves of all the gold they had, brought it to the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>. The senators only delivered their rings, and the bullae about their children's necks. As for the silver <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>, it was now, for the first time, alloyed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, and increased in its value. Thus the finances were put into a good condition, and a competent army raised.\n\nThis was plainly the last effort the Romans could make; and could Hannibal have procured a sufficient supply of men and money to enable him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPE\">cope</a> with this army, and to break it as he had done the others before, there could have been no more resistance made on their part. He began, however, to be in want of money; and to procure it, gave the Roman prisoners leave to redeem themselves. These unhappy men agreed to send ten of their body to Rome to negotiate their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDEMPTION\">redemption</a>; and Hannibal required no other security for their return but their oath. Carthalo was sent at the head of them to make proposals of peace; but upon the first news of his arrival, the dictator sent a litter to him, commanding him immediately to depart the Roman territory; and it was resolved not to redeem the captives. Upon this Hannibal sent the most considerable of them to Carthage; and of the rest he made gladiators, obliging them to fight with one another,\nCarthage. another, even relations with relations, for the entertain-\nment of the troops.\n\nAll this time Cneius and Publius Scipio had carried on the war in Spain with great success against\nthe Carthaginians. Afdrubal had been ordered to enter Italy with his army to assist Hannibal; but being\ndefeated by the Romans, was prevented. The dictator and senate of Rome, encouraged by this news,\ncarried on the preparations for the next campaign with the greatest vigour, whilst Hannibal remained in-\nactive at Capua. This inaction, however, seems to have proceeded from his expectation of succours from\nAfrica, which never came, and which delay occasioned his ruin. The Roman dictator now released from\nprison all criminals, and persons confined for debt, who were willing to enlist themselves. Of these he\nformed a body of 6000 foot, armed with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> swords and bucklers formerly taken from the Gauls.\nThen the Roman army, to the number of about 25,000 men, marched out of the city under the command of\nthe dictator; while Marcellus kept the remains of Varro's army, amounting to about 15,000 men, at\nCaflinum, in readiness to march whenever there should be occasion.\n\nThus the Roman forces were still superior to those of Hannibal; and as they now saw the necessity of\nfollowing the example of Fabius Maximus, no engagement of any consequence happened the first year after\nthe battle of Cannae. Hannibal made a fruitless attempt upon Nola, expecting it would be delivered up\nto him; but this was prevented by Marcellus, who had entered that city, and falling unexpectedly from three\ngates upon the Carthaginians, obliged them to retire in great confusion, with the loss of 5000 men. This\nwas the first advantage that had been gained by the Romans where Hannibal had commanded in person,\nand raised the spirits of the former not a little. They were, however, greatly dejected, on hearing that the\nconsul Polthumius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBINUS\">Albinus</a>, with his whole army, had been cut off by the Boii, as he was crossing a forest.\nUpon this it was resolved to draw all the Roman forces out of Gaul and other countries, and turn them\nagainst Hannibal; so that the Carthaginian stood daily more and more in need of those supplies, which yet\nnever arrived from Carthage. He reduced, however, the cities of Nuceria, Caflinum, Petelia, Conflentia,\nCrotona, Locri, and several others in Great Greece, before the Romans gained any advantage over him, ex-\ncept that before Nola, already mentioned. The Campanians, who had espoused the Carthaginian interest,\nraised an army of 14,000 of their own nation in favour of Hannibal, and put one Marius Albus at the\nhead of it; but he was surprised by the consul Sempronius, who defeated and killed him, with 2000 of\nhis men. It was now found that Hannibal had concluded a treaty of alliance, offensive and defensive, with\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> king of Macedon; but to prevent any disturbance from that quarter, a Roman army was sent to\nMacedon. Soon after this Marcellus defeated Han-\nnibal in a pitched battle, having armed his men with\nlong pikes used generally at sea, and chiefly in boarding of ships; by which means the Carthaginians were\npierced through, while they were totally unable to hurt their adversaries with the short javelins they car-\nried. Marcellus pursued them close; and before they\ngot to their camp, killed 5000, and took 600 pri-\nsoners; losing himself about 1000 men, who were trod\ndown by the Numidian horse, commanded by Han-\nnibal in person. After this defeat the Carthaginian He is de-\nfended himself defeated by 1200 of his best ferred by a\nhorse, partly Spaniards, and partly Numidians, who party of\nhad crossed the Alps with him. This touched him fo-\nseemly, that he left Campania, and retired into Apu-\nlia.\n\nThe Romans still continued to increase their forces;\nand Hannibal, not having the same resources, found it\nimpossible to act against so many armies at once. Fa-\nbius Maximus advanced into Campania, whither Han-\nnibal was obliged to return in order to save Capua.\nHe ordered Hannibal, however, at the head of 17,000\nfoot and 1700 horse, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVENTUM\">Beneventum</a>; but he\nwas utterly defeated, scarce 2000 of his men being left.\nHannibal himself, in the mean time, advanced\ndefeated, to Nola, where he was again defeated by Marcellus, and begins\nHe now began to lose ground; the Romans took to lose\nCaflinum, Acca in Apulia, Arpi, and Aternum; ground,\nbut the city of Tarentum was delivered up to him by its inhabitants. The Romans then entered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAM\">Cam</a>-\npagna, and ravaged the whole country, threatening Ca-\npua with a siege. The inhabitants immediately ac-\nquainted Hannibal with their danger; but he was so\ncertain upon reducing the citadel of Tarentum, that he\ncould not be prevailed upon to come to their assistance.\nIn the mean time Hannibal was again utterly defeated by\nFulvius, his camp taken, and he himself forced to fly\ninto Bruttium, with a small body of horse. The con-\nsuls then advanced with a design to besiege Capua in\nform. But in their way, Sempronius Gracchus, a\nman of great bravery, and an excellent general, was\nbetrayed by a Lucanian and killed, which proved a\nvery great detriment to the republic. Capua, how-\never, was soon after invested on all sides; and the be-\nsieged once more sent to Hannibal, who now came to the Ro-\nmains assistance with his horse, his light-armed infantry, mans\nand 33 elephants. He found means to inform the be-\nsieged of the time he designed to attack the Romans, in vain\nordering them to make a vigorous sally at the same attempts to\ntime. The Roman generals, Appius and Fulvius, relieve it.\nupon the first news of the enemy's approach, divided\ntheir troops; Appius taking upon him to make head\nagainst the garrison, and Fulvius to defend the in-\ntrenchments against Hannibal. The former found no\ndifficulty in repelling the garrison; and would have\nentered the city with them, had he not been wounded\nat the very gate, which prevented him from pursuing\nhis design. Fulvius found it more difficult to with-\nstand Hannibal, whose troops behaved themselves with\nextraordinary resolution. A body of Spaniards and\nNumidians had even the boldness to pass the ditch,\nand in spite of all opposition, climbing the ramparts,\npenetrated into the Roman camp; but not being pro-\nperly seconded by the rest, they were all to a man cut\nin pieces. The Carthaginian general was so disheart-\nened at this, especially after the garrison was repelled,\nthat he founded a retreat, which was made in good\norder. His next attempt for the relief of Capua was\nto march to Rome, where he hoped his approach to Rome.\nwould strike so much terror, that the armies would be\ncalled from before Capua; and that the Capuans might\nnot be disheartened by his sudden departure, he found\nmeans\nCarthage means to acquaint them with his design. The news of his approach caused great consternation in the metropolis. Some of the senators were for calling all the armies in Italy into the neighbourhood of Rome, as thinking nothing less was able to resist the terrible Carthaginian. But Fabius told them that Hannibal's design was not, to take Rome, but relieve Capua; upon which Fulvius was recalled to Rome with 15,000 foot and 1000 horse; and this obliged Hannibal again to retire. He then returned before Capua so suddenly that he surprized Appius in his camp, drove him out of it with the loss of a great number of men, and obliged him to intrench himself on some eminences, where he expected to be soon joined by his colleague Fulvius.\n\nAs Hannibal, however, now expected to have all the Roman forces upon him, he could do nothing more for the relief of Capua; which was of consequence obliged to submit to the Romans.\n\nA little before the surrender of Capua, Hannibal came up with a Roman army commanded by one M. Centenius Penula, who had signalized himself on many occasions as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CENTURION\">centurion</a>. This rash man, being introduced to the senate, had the assurance to tell them, that if they would trust him with a body of only 5000 men, he would give a good account of Hannibal. They gave him 8000, and his army was soon increased to double that number. He engaged the Carthaginians on Hannibal's first offering him battle; but after an engagement of two hours, was defeated, himself and all his men being slain except about 1000. Soon after, having found means to draw the praetor Cneius Fulvius into an ambuscade, Hannibal cut in pieces almost his whole army, consisting of 18,000 men.\n\nIn the mean time Marcellus was making great progress in Samnium. The city of Salapia was betrayed to him; but he took other two by assault. In the last of these he found 3000 Carthaginians, whom he put to the sword; and carried off 240,000 bushels of wheat, and 110,000 of barley. This, however, was by no means a compensation for the defeat which Hannibal soon after gave the proconsul Fulvius Centumalus, whom he surprized and cut off, with 13,000 of his men.\n\nAfter this defeat the great Marcellus advanced with his army to oppose Hannibal. Various engagements happened without any thing decisive. In one of them the Romans are said to have been defeated, and in another Hannibal; but notwithstanding these, it was neither in the power of Marcellus, nor any other Roman general, totally to defeat or disperse the army commanded by Hannibal in person. Nay, in the eleventh year of the war, Hannibal found means to decoy into an ambuscade and cut off the great Marcellus himself; the consequence of which was, that the Romans were obliged to raise the siege of Locri, with the loss of all their military engines.\n\nHitherto, the Carthaginians, though no longer the favourites of fortune, had lost but little ground; but now they met with a blow which totally ruined their affairs. This was the defeat of Afridrual, Hannibal's brother, who had left Spain, and was marching to his assistance. He crossed the Pyrenees, without any difficulty; and, as the silver mines had supplied him with a very considerable quantity of treasure, he not only prevailed upon the Gauls to grant him a passage through their territories, but likewise to furnish him with a considerable number of recruits. Meeting with many favourable circumstances to expedite his march, he arrived at Placentia sooner than the Romans or even his brother Hannibal expected. Had he continued to use the same expedition with which he set out, and hastened to join his brother, it would have been utterly impossible to have saved Rome; but, sitting down before Placentia, he gave the Romans an opportunity of assembling all their forces to attack him. At last he was obliged to raise the siege, and began his march for Umbria. He sent a letter to acquaint his brother of his intended motion; but the messenger was intercepted; and the two consuls, joining their armies, with united forces fell upon the Carthaginians. As the latter were inferior both in numbers and resolution, they were utterly defeated, and Afridrual was killed. About the same time, Hannibal himself is said to have suffered several defeats, and was retired to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANUSIUM\">Canusium</a>: but, on the fatal news of his brother's defeat and death, he was filled with despair, and retired to the extremity of Bruttium: where, assembling all his forces, he remained for a considerable time in a state of inaction, the Romans not daring to disturb him; so formidable did they esteem him alone, though every thing about him went to wreck, and the Carthaginian affairs seemed not far from the verge of destruction. Livy tells us, that it was difficult to determine whether his conduct was more wonderful in prosperity or in adversity. Notwithstanding which, Bruttium being but a small province, and many of its inhabitants being either forced into the service, or forming themselves into parties of banditti, so that a great part of it remained uncultivated, he found it a difficult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> to subsist there, especially as no manner of supplies were sent him from Carthage. The people there were as solicitous about preserving their possessions in Spain, and as little concerned about the situation of affairs in Italy, as if Hannibal had met with an uninterrupted course of success, and no disaster befallen him since he first entered that country.\n\nAll their solicitude, however, about the affairs of Spain, was to no purpose; their generals, one after progress of another, were defeated by the Romans. They had Scipio Africanus indeed cut off the two Scipios; but found a much more formidable enemy in the young Scipio, afterwards named Africanus. He overthrew them in conjunction with Massinissa king of Numidia; and the latter thereafter abandoned their interest. Soon after, Syphax, king of the Massylii, was likewise persuaded to abandon their party. Scipio also gave the Spanish Reguli a great overthrow, and reduced the cities of New Carthage, Gades, and many other important places. At last the Carthaginians began to open their eyes when it was too late. Mago was ordered to abandon Spain, and fail with all expedition to Italy. He landed on the coast of Liguria with an army of 12,000 foot and 2000 horse; where he surprised <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENOA\">Genoa</a>, and also seized upon the town and port of Savo. A reinforcement was sent him to this place, and new levies went on very briskly in Liguria; but the opportunity was past, and could not be recalled. Scipio having carried all before him in Spain, passed over into Africa, where he met with no enemy capable\nCarthage, of opposing his projects. The Carthaginians then, seeing themselves on the brink of destruction, were obliged to recall their armies from Italy, in order to save their city. Mago, who had entered Insubria, was defeated by the Roman forces there; and having retreated into the maritime parts of Liguria, met a courier who brought him orders to return directly to Carthage. At the same time, Hannibal was likewise recalled. When the messengers acquainted him with the senate's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, he expressed the utmost indignation and concern, groaning, gnashing his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, and scarce refraining from tears. Never banished man, according to Livy, showed so much regret in quitting his native country, as Hannibal did at going out of that of the enemy.\n\nThe Carthaginian general was no sooner landed in Africa, than he sent out parties to get provisions for the army, and buy horses to remount the cavalry. He entered into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> with the regulus of the Arecaceae, one of the Numidian tribes. Four thousand of Syphax's horde came over in a body to him; but as he did not think proper to repose any confidence in them, he put them all to the sword, and distributed their horses among his troops. Vermina, one of Syphax's sons, and Maetelus, another Numidian prince, likewise joined him with a considerable body of horse. Most of the fortresses in Massinissa's kingdom either surrendered to him upon the first summons, or were taken by force. Narce, a city of considerable note there, he made himself master of by stratagem. Tychea, a Numidian regulus, and faithful ally of Syphax, whose territories were famous for an excellent breed of horses, reinforcing him also with 2000 of his best cavalry, Hannibal advanced to Zama, a town above five days' journey distant from Carthage, where he encamped. He thence sent out spies to observe the posture of the Romans. These being brought to Scipio, he was far from inflicting any punishment upon them, which he might have done by the laws of war, that he commanded them to be led about the camp, in order to take an exact survey of it, and then dismissed them. Hannibal admiring the noble assurance of his rival, sent a messenger to desire an interview with him; which, by means of Massinissa, he obtained. The two generals, therefore, escorted by equal detachments of horse, met at Nadagara, where, by the assistance of two interpreters, they held a private conference. Hannibal flattered Scipio in the most refined and artful manner, and expatiated upon all those topics which he thought could influence that general to grant his nation a peace upon tolerable terms; amongst other things, that the Carthaginians would willingly confine themselves to Africa, since such was the will of the gods, in order to procure a lasting peace, whilst the Romans would be at liberty to extend their conquests to the remotest nations. Scipio answered, that the Romans were not prompted by ambition, or any sinister views, to undertake either the former or present war against the Carthaginians, but by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> and a proper regard for their allies. He also observed, that the Carthaginians had, before his arrival in Africa, not only made him the same proposals, but likewise agreed to pay the Romans 5000 talents of silver, restore all the Roman prisoners without ransom, and deliver up all their galleys. He insisted on the pernicious conduct of the Carthaginians, who had broken a truce concluded with them; and told him, that, so far from granting them more favourable terms, they ought to expect more rigorous ones; which if Hannibal would submit to, a peace would ensue; if not, the decision of the dispute must be left to the sword.\n\nThis conference, betwixt two of the greatest generals the world ever produced, ending without success, of Zama, they both retired to their respective camps; where they informed their troops, that not only the fate of Rome and Carthage, but that of the whole world, was to be determined by them the next day. An engagement ensued *, in which, as Polybius informs us, the surprising military genius of Hannibal displayed itself in an extraordinary manner. Scipio likewise, according to Livy, paid a high encomium upon him, on account of his uncommon capacity in taking advantages, the excellent arrangement of his forces, and the manner in which he gave his orders during the engagement. The Roman general, indeed, not only approved his conduct, but openly declared that it was superior to his own. Nevertheless, being vastly inferior to the enemy in horse, and the state of Carthage obliging him to hazard a battle with the Romans at no small disadvantage, Hannibal was utterly routed, and his camp taken. He fled first to Thon, and afterwards to Adrumentum, from whence he was recalled to Carthage; where being arrived, he advised his countrymen to conclude a peace with Scipio on whatever terms he thought proper to prescribe.\n\nThus was the second war of the Carthaginians with the Romans concluded. The conditions of peace concluded were very humiliating to the Carthaginians. They were obliged to deliver up all the Roman deserters, fugitive slaves, prisoners of war, and all the Italians whom Hannibal had obliged to follow him. They also delivered up all their ships of war, except ten triremes, all their tame elephants, and were to train up no more of these animals for the service. They were not to engage in any war without the consent of the Romans. They engaged to pay to the Romans, in 50 years, 10,000 Euboic talents, at equal payments. They were to restore to Massinissa all they had usurped from him or his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, and to enter into an alliance with him. They were also to assist the Romans both by sea and land, whenever they were called upon to do so, and never to make any levies either in Gaul or Liguria. These terms appeared so intolerable to the populace that they threatened to plunder and burn the houses of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>; but Hannibal having assembled a body of 6000 foot and 500 horse at Marthama, prevented an insurrection, and by his influence completed the accommodation.\n\nThe peace between Carthage and Rome was scarcely signed, when Massinissa unjustly made himself master of part of the Carthaginian dominions in Africa, under pretence that these formerly belonged to his family. The Carthaginians, through the villainous mediation of the Romans, found themselves under a necessity of ceding these countries to that ambitious prince, and of entering into an alliance with him. The good understanding between the two powers continued for many years afterwards; but at last Massinissa violated the treaties subsisting betwixt him and the Carthaginian.\nCarthage, thaginian republic, and not a little contributed to its subversion.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the peace, Hannibal still kept up his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> among his countrymen. He was intrusted with the command of an army against some neighbouring nations in Africa; but this being disagreeable to the Romans, he was removed from it, and raised to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of praetor in Carthage. Here he continued for some time, reforming abuses, and putting the affairs of the republic into a better condition; but this likewise being disagreeable to the Romans, he was obliged to fly to Antiochus king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>. After his flight, the Romans began to look upon the Carthaginians with a suspicious eye; though to prevent every thing of this kind, the latter had ordered two ships to pursue Hannibal, had confiscated his effects, raised his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, and by a public decree declared him an exile. Soon after, disputes arising between the Carthaginians and Massinissa, the latter, notwithstanding the manifest iniquity of his proceedings, was supported by the Romans. That prince, grasping at further conquests, endeavoured to embroil the Carthaginians with the Romans, by alleging that the former had received ambassadors from Perseus king of Macedon; that the senate assembled in the temple of \u00c6sculapius in the night time, in order to confer with them; and that ambassadors had been despatched from Carthage to Perseus, in order to conclude an alliance with him. Not long after this, Massinissa made an irruption into the province of Tyre, where he soon possessed himself of 70, or, as Appian will have it, 50 towns and castles. This obliged the Carthaginians to apply with great importunity to the Roman senate for redress, their hands being so tied up by an article in the last treaty, that they could not repel force by force, in case of an invasion, without their consent. Their ambassadors begged, that the Roman senate would settle once for all what dominions they were to have, that they might from thenceforth know what they had to depend upon; or if their state had any way offended the Romans, they begged that they would punish them themselves, rather than leave them exposed to the insults and vexations of so merciless a tyrant. Then prostrating themselves on the earth, they burst out into tears. But, notwithstanding the impression their speech made, the matter was left undecided; so that Massinissa had liberty to pursue his rapines, as much as he pleased. But whatever villainous designs the Romans might have with regard to the republic of Carthage, they affected to show a great regard to the principles of justice and honour. They therefore sent Cato, a man famous for committing enormities under the specious pretence of public spirit, into Africa, to accommodate all differences betwixt Massinissa and the Carthaginians. The latter very well knew their fate, had they submitted to such a mediation; and therefore appealed to the treaty concluded with Scipio, as the only rule by which their conduct and that of their adversary ought to be examined. This unreasonable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> so incensed the righteous Cato, that he pronounced them a devoted people, and from that time resolved upon their destruction. For some time he was opposed by Scipio Nasica; but the people of Carthage, knowing the Romans to be their inveterate enemies, and reflecting upon the iniquitous treatment they had met with from them ever since the commencement of their disputes with Massinissa, were under great apprehensions of a visit from them. To prevent a rupture as much as possible, by a decree of the senate, they impeached Asdrubai general of the army, and Carthalo, commander of the auxiliary forces, together with their accomplices, as guilty of high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a> for being the authors of the war against the king of Numidia. They sent a deputation to Rome, to discover what sentiments were entertained there of their late conduct, and to know what satisfaction the Romans required. These messengers meeting with a cold reception, others were despatched, who returned with the same success. This made the unhappy citizens of Carthage believe that their destruction was resolved upon; which threw them into the utmost despair. And indeed they had but too just grounds for such a melancholy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>, the Roman senate now discovering an inclination to fall in with Cato's measures. About the same time, the city of Utica, being the second in Africa, and famous for its immense riches, as well as its equally commodious and capacious port, submitted to the Romans. Upon the possession of so important a fortress, which, by reason of its vicinity to Carthage, might serve as a place of arms in the attack of that city, the Romans declared war against Carthage, without the least hesitation. In consequence of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a>, the consuls M. Manlius Nepos, and L. Marcius Censorinus, were despatched with an army and fleet to begin hostilities with the utmost expedition. The land forces consisted of 80,000 foot and 4000 chosen horse; and the fleet of 50 quinqueremes, besides a vast number of transports. The consuls had secret orders from the senate not to conclude the operations but by the destruction of Carthage, without which, it was pretended, the republic could not but look upon all her possessions as insecure. Pursuant to the plan they had formed, the troops were first landed at Lilybeum in Sicily, from whence, after receiving a proper refreshment, it was proposed to transport them to Utica.\n\nThe answer brought by the last ambassadors to Carthage had not a little alarmed the inhabitants of that city. But they were not yet acquainted with the resolutions taken at Rome. They therefore sent fresh ambassadors thither, whom they invested with full powers to act as they thought proper for the good of the republic, and even to submit themselves without reserve to the pleasure of the Romans. But the most sensible persons among them did not expect any great success from this condescension, since the early submission of the Uticans had rendered it infinitely less meritorious than it would have been before. However, the Romans seemed to be in some measure satisfied with it, since they promised them their liberty, the enjoyment of their laws, and in short, every thing that was dear and valuable to them. This threw them into a transport of joy, and they wanted words to extol the moderation of the Romans. But the senate immediately dashed all their hopes, by acquainting them that this favour was granted upon condition that they would send 300 young Carthaginian noblemen of the first distinction to the praetor Fabius at Lilybeum, within the space of 30 days; and comply with all the orders of the consuls. These hard terms filled\nCarthage filled the whole city with inexpressible grief; but the hostages were delivered; and as they arrived at Lilyb\u00e6um before the 30 days were expired, the ambassadors were not without hopes of softening their hard-hearted enemy. But the consuls only told them, that upon their arrival at Utica they should learn the further orders of the republic.\n\nThe ministers no sooner received intelligence of the Roman fleet appearing off Utica, than they repaired thither, in order to know the fate of their city. The consuls however did not judge it expedient to communicate all the commands of the republic at once, lest they should appear so harsh and severe, that the Carthaginians would have refused to comply with them. They first, therefore, demanded a sufficient supply of corn for the subsistence of their troops. Secondly, That they should deliver up into their hands all the triremes they were then masters of. Thirdly, That they should put them in possession of all their military machines. And fourthly, That they should immediately convey all their arms into the Roman camp.\n\nAs care was taken that there should be a convenient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of time betwixt every one of these demands, the Carthaginians found themselves enframed, and could not reject any one of them, though they submitted to the last with the utmost reluctance and concern. Cenforius now imagining them incapable of sustaining a siege, commanded them to abandon their city, or, as Zonaras will have it, to demolish it; permitting them to build another 80 stadia from the sea, but without walls or fortifications. This terrible decree threw the senate and every one else into despair; and the whole city became a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of horror, madness, and confusion. The citizens cursed their ancestors for not dying gloriously in the defence of their country, rather than concluding such ignominious treaties of peace, that had been the cause of the deplorable condition to which their posterity was then reduced. At length, when the first commotion was a little abated, the senators assembled, and resolved to sustain a siege. They were stripped of their arms and destitute of provisions; but despair raised their courage, and made them find out expedients. They took care to shut the gates of the city; and gathered together on the ramparts great heaps of stones, to serve them instead of arms in case of a surprize. They took the malefactors out of prison, gave the slaves their liberty, and incorporated them in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a>. Asdrubal was recalled, who had been sentenced to die only to please the Romans; and he was invited to employ 20,000 men he had raised against his country in defence of it. Another Asdrubal was appointed to command in Carthage; and all seemed resolute, either to save their city or perish in its ruins. They wanted arms; but, by order of the senate, the temples, porticoes, and all public buildings, were turned into workhouses, where men and women were continually employed in making arms. As they encouraged one another in their work, and lost no time in procuring to themselves the necessaries of life, which were brought to them at stated hours, they every day made 144 bucklers, 300 swords, 1000 darts, and 500 lances and javelins. As to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> and catapults, they wanted proper materials for them; but their industry supplied that defect. Where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> were wanting, they made use of silver Carthage, and gold, melting down the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a>, vases, and even the utensils of private families; for, on this occasion, even the most covetous became liberal. As tow and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a> were wanting to make cords for working the machines, the women, even those of the first rank, freely cut off their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> and dedicated it to that use. Without the walls, Asdrubal employed the troops in getting together provisions, and conveying them safe into Carthage; so that there was as great plenty there as in the Roman camp.\n\nIn the mean time the consuls delayed drawing near to Carthage, not doubting but the inhabitants, whom they imagined destitute of necessaries to sustain a siege, would, upon cool reflection, submit; but at length, finding themselves deceived in their expectation, they came before the place and invested it. As they were still persuaded that the Carthaginians had no arms, they flattered themselves that they should easily carry the city by assault. Accordingly they approached the city walls in order to plant their scaling ladders; but attacked by the Romans, who are repulsed, they discovered a prodigious multitude of men on the ramparts, shining in the armour they had newly made. The legionaries were terrified at this unexpected sight, that they drew back, and would have retired, if the consuls had not led them on to the attack; which, however, proved unsuccessful; the Romans, in spite of their utmost efforts, being obliged to give over the enterprise, and lay aside all thoughts of taking Carthage by assault. In the mean time, Asdrubal, having collected from all places subject to Carthage a prodigious number of troops, came and encamped within reach of the Romans, and soon reduced them to great straits for want of provisions. As Marcius, one of the Roman consuls, was posted near a marsh, the exhalations of the stagnating waters, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the season, infected the air, and caused a general sickness among his men. Marcius, therefore, ordered his fleet to draw as near the shore as possible, in order to transport his troops to a healthier place. Asdrubal being informed of this motion, ordered all the old barks in the harbour Romanfleet to be filled with faggots, tow, sulphur, bitumen, and destroyed other combustible materials; and then taking advantage of the wind, which blew towards the enemy, let them drive upon their ships, which were for the most part consumed. After this disaster, Marcius was called home to preside at the elections; and the Carthaginians <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> upon the absence of one of the consuls to be a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OMEN\">omen</a>, made a brisk fall in the night; and would have surprized the consul's camp, had not \u00c6milianus, with some squadrons, marched out of the gate opposite to the place where the attack was made, and, coming round, fell unexpectedly on their rear, and obliged them to return in disorder to the city.\n\nAsdrubal had posted himself under the walls of a city named Nephoris, 24 miles distant from Carthage, and situated on a high mountain, which seemed inaccessible on all sides. From thence he made incursions into the neighbouring country, intercepted the Roman convoys, fell upon their detachments sent out to forage, and even ordered parties to insult the confederate army in their camp. Hereupon the consul resolved to drive the Carthaginian from this advantageous post, and set out for Nephoris. As he drew near the hills, Asdrubal\nbal suddenly appeared at the head of his army in order of battle, and fell upon the Romans with incredible fury. The consular army sustained the attack with great resolution; and Afdrubal retired in good order to his post, hoping the Romans would attack him there. But the consul, being now convinced of his danger, resolved to retire. This Afdrubal no sooner perceived, than he rushed down the hill, and falling upon the enemy's rear, cut a great number of them in pieces. The whole Roman army was now saved by the bravery of Scipio \u00c6milianus. At the head of 300 horse, he sustained the attack of all the forces commanded by Afdrubal, and covered the legions, while they passed a river in their retreat before the enemy. Then he and his companions threw themselves into the stream, and swam across it. When the army had crossed the river, it was perceived that four manipuli were wanting; and soon after they were informed that they had retired to an eminence, where they resolved to sell their lives as dear as possible. Upon this news \u00c6milianus, taking with him a chosen body of horse, and provisions for two days, crossed the river, and flew to the assistance of his countrymen. He seized a hill over against that on which the four manipuli were posted; and, after some hours' repose, marched against the Carthaginians who kept them invested; fell upon them at the head of his squadron with the boldness of a man determined to conquer or die; and, in spite of all opposition, opened a way for his fellow soldiers to escape. On his return to the army, his companions, who had given him over for lost, carried him to his quarters in a kind of triumph; and the manipuli he had saved gave him a crown of garlands. By these and some other exploits, \u00c6milianus gained such reputation, that Cato, who is said never to have commended anybody before, could not refuse him the praises he deserved; and is said to have foretold that Carthage would never be reduced till Scipio \u00c6milianus was employed in that expedition.\n\nThe next year, the war in Africa fell by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> to the consul L. Calpurnius Piso; and he continued to employ \u00c6milianus in several important enterprises, in which he was attended with uncommon success. He took several castles; and in one of his excursions, found means to have a private conference with Phameas, general, under Afdubal, of the Carthaginian cavalry, and brought him over, together with 2200 of his horse, to the Roman interest. Under the consul Calpurnius Piso himself, however, the Roman arms were unsuccessful. He invested Clupea; but was obliged to abandon the enterprise, with the loss of a great number of men killed by the enemy in their sallies. From this place he went to vent his rage on a city newly built, and thence called Neapolis, which professed a strict neutrality, and had even a safeguard from the Romans. The consul, however, plundered the place, and stripped the inhabitants of all their effects. After this he laid siege to Hippagretia, which employed the Roman fleet and army the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>; and, on the approach of winter, the consul retired to Utica, without performing a single action worth notice during the whole campaign.\n\nThe next year Scipio \u00c6milianus was chosen consul, and ordered to pass into Africa; and upon his arrival, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of affairs was greatly changed. At the time of his entering the port of Utica, 3500 Romans were Carthaginians in great danger of being cut in pieces before Carthage. There he feasted Megalia, one of the suburbs of the city: but as they had not furnished themselves with provisions to sustain there, and could not retire, being closely invested on all sides by the enemy's troops, the praetor Mancinus, who commanded this detachment, seeing the danger into which he had brought himself, despatched a light boat to Utica, to acquaint the Romans there with his situation. \u00c6milianus received this letter a few hours after his landing; and immediately flew to the relief of the beleaguered Romans, obliged the Carthaginians to retire within their walls, and safely conveyed his countrymen to Utica. Having then drawn together all the troops, \u00c6milianus applied himself wholly to the siege of the capital.\n\nHis first attack was upon Megalia; which he carried by assault, the Carthaginian garrison retiring into Afdubal, the citadel of Byrsa. Afdubal, who had commanded the Carthaginian forces in the field, and was now governor of the city, was so enraged at the loss of Megalia, that he caused all the Roman captives taken in the two years the war lasted, to be brought upon the ramparts, and thrown headlong, in the fight of the Roman army, from the top of the wall; after having, with an excess of cruelty, commanded their hands and feet to be cut off, and their eyes and tongues to be torn out. He was of a temper remarkably inhuman; and it is said that he even took pleasure in feeding some of these unhappy men flayed alive. \u00c6milianus, in the mean time, was busy in drawing lines of circumvallation and contravallation across the neck of land which joined the isthmus on which Carthage stood to the continent. By this means, all the avenues on the land side of Carthage being shut up, the city could receive no provisions that way. His next care was to raise a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOLE\">mole</a> in the sea, in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> up the old port, the new one being already shut up by the Roman fleet; and this great work he effected with immense labour. The mole reached from the western neck of land, of which the Romans were masters, to the entrance of the port; and was 90 feet broad at the bottom and 80 at the top. The beleaguered, when the Romans first began this surprising work, laughed at the attempt; but were no less alarmed than surprised, when they beheld a vast mole appearing above water, and by that means the port rendered inaccessible to ships, and quite useless. Prompted by despair, however, the Carthaginians, with incredible and almost miraculous industry, dug a new basin, and cut a pallage into the sea, by which they could receive the provisions that were sent them by their troops in the field. With the same diligence and expedition, they fitted out a fleet of 50 triremes; which to the great surprise of the Romans, appeared suddenly advancing into the sea through this new canal, and even ventured to give the enemy battle. The action lasted the whole day, with little advantage on either side. The day after, the consul endeavoured to make himself master of a terrace which covered the city on the side next the sea; and on this occasion the beleaguered signalized themselves in a most remarkable manner. Great numbers of them, naked and unarmed, went into the water in the dead of the night, with unlighted torches in their hands; and having, partly by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a>, partly by wading, got within reach of the Roman\nRoman engines, they struck fire, lighted their torches and threw them with fury against the machines. The sudden appearance of these naked men, who looked like so many monsters started up out of the sea, so terrified the Romans who guarded the machines, that they began to retire with the utmost confusion. The consul, who commanded the detachment in person, had continued all night at the foot of the terrace, endeavored to stop his men, and even ordered those who fled to be killed. But the Carthaginians, perceiving the confusion the Romans were in, threw themselves upon them like so many wild beasts; and having put them to flight only with their torches, they let fire to the machines, and entirely consumed them. This, however, did not discourage the consul; he renewed the attack a few days after, carried the terrace by assault, and lodged 4000 men upon it. As this was an important post, because it pent in Carthage on the sea side, \u00c6milianus took care to fortify and secure it against the fallies of the enemy; and then, winter approaching, he suspended all further attacks upon the place till the return of good weather. During the winter season, however, the consul was not inactive. The Carthaginians had a very numerous army under the command of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOGENES\">Diogenes</a>, strongly encamped near Nepheris, whence convoys of provisions were sent by sea to the besieged, and brought into the new bastion. To take Nepheris, therefore, was to deprive Carthage of her chief magazine. This \u00c6milianus undertook, and succeeded in the attempt. He first forced the enemy's intrenchments, put 70,000 of them to the sword, and made 10,000 prisoners; all the inhabitants of the country, who could not retire to Carthage, having taken refuge in this camp. After this he laid siege to Nepheris, which was reduced in 22 days. Adrubar being disheartened by the defeat of the army, and touched with the misery of the besieged, now reduced to the utmost extremity for want of provisions, offered to submit to what conditions the Romans pleased, provided the city was spared; but this was absolutely refused.\n\nEarly in the spring, \u00c6milianus renewed the siege of Carthage; and in order to open himself a way into the city, he ordered Laelius to attempt the reduction of Cotho, a small island which divided the two ports. \u00c6milianus himself made a false attack on the citadel, in order to draw the enemy thither. This stratagem had the desired effect; for the citadel being a place of the greatest importance, most of the Carthaginians hastened thither, and made the utmost efforts to repulse the aggressors; but in the mean time Laelius having, with incredible expedition, built a wooden bridge over the channel which divided Cotho from the isthmus, entered the island, scaled the walls of the forts which the Carthaginians had built there, and made himself master of that important post. The consul, who was engaged before Byrsa, no sooner understood, by the loud shouts of the troops of Laelius, that he had made himself master of Cotho, than he abandoned the false attack, and unexpectedly fell on the neighboring gate of the city, which he broke down, notwithstanding the showers of darts that were incessantly discharged upon his men from the ramparts. As night coming on prevented him from proceeding farther, he made a lodgment within the gate, and waited there for the return of day, with a design to advance through the city to the citadel, and attack it on that side, which was but indifferently fortified. Pursuant to this design, at day break, he ordered 4000 fresh troops to be sent from his camp; and having solemnly devoted to the infernal gods the unhappy Carthaginians, he began to advance at the head of his men through the streets of the city, in order to attack the citadel. Having advanced to the marketplace, he found that the way to the citadel lay through three exceeding steep streets. The houses on both sides were very high, and filled with Carthaginians, who overwhelmed the Romans as they advanced with darts and stones; so that they could not proceed till they had cleared them. To this end \u00c6milianus in person, at the head of a detachment, attacked the first house, and made himself master of it sword in hand. His example was followed by the officers and soldiers, who went on from house to house, putting all they met with to the sword. As fast as the houses were cleared on both sides, the Romans advanced in order of battle towards the citadel; but met with a vigorous resistance from the Carthaginians, who on this occasion behaved with uncommon resolution. From the marketplace to the citadel, two bodies of men fought their way every step, one above on the roofs of the houses, the other below in the streets. The slaughter was inexpressibly great and dreadful. The air rung with shrieks and lamentations. Some were cut in pieces, others threw themselves down from the tops of the houses; so that the streets were filled with dead and mangled bodies. But the destruction was yet greater, when the proconsul commanded fire to be set to that part of the quarter of the town which lay next to the citadel. Incredible multitudes, who had escaped the swords of the enemy, perished in the flames, or by the fall of the houses. After the fire, which lasted five days, had demolished a sufficient number of houses, \u00c6milianus ordered the rubbish to removed, and a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> to be made, where all the troops might have room to act. Then he appeared with his whole army before Byrsa; which so terrified the Carthaginians, who had fled thither for refuge, that first of all 25,000 women, and then 30,000 men, came out of the gates in such a condition as moved pity. They threw themselves prostrate before the Roman general, asking no favour but life. This was readily granted, not only to them but to all that were in Byrsa except the Roman defectors, whose number amounted to 900. Adrubar's cruelty and wife earnestly entreated her husband to suffer her to cowardice join the suppliants, and carry with her to the proconsul her two sons who were as yet very young; but the barbarian denied her request, and rejected her remonstrances with menaces. The Roman defectors, seeing themselves excluded from mercy, resolved to die sword in hand, rather than deliver themselves up to the vengeance of their countrymen. Then Adrubar, finding them all resolved to defend themselves to the last breath, committed to their care his wife and children; after which, he in a most cowardly and mean-spirited manner, came and privately threw himself at the conqueror's feet. The Carthaginians in the citadel no sooner understood that their commander had abandoned the place, than they threw open the gates, and put the Romans in possession of Byrsa. They had now\nno enemy to contend with but the 900 deserters, who, being reduced to despair, retreated into the temple of \u00c6sculapius, which was as a second temple within the first. There the proconsul attacked them; and these unhappy wretches, finding there was no way to escape, set fire to the temple. As the flames spread, they retreated from one part of the building to another, till they got to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a>. There A'druba's wife appeared in her best apparel, and having uttered the most bitter imprecations against her husband, whom she saw standing below with \u00c6milianus, \"Safe coward (said she), the mean things thou hast done to save thy life shall not avail thee: thou shalt die this infant, at least in thy two children.\" Having thus spoken, she stabbed both the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> with a dagger; and while they were yet struggling for life, threw them both from the top of the temple, and then leaped down after them into the flames.\n\n\u00c6milianus delivered up the city to be plundered, but in the manner prescribed by the Roman military law. The soldiers were allowed to appropriate to themselves all the furniture, utensils, and brass money, they should find in private houses; but all the gold and silver, the statues, pictures, &c. were referred to be put into the hands of the questors. On this occasion the cities of Sicily, which had been often plundered by the Carthaginian armies, recovered a number of statues, pictures, and other valuable monuments; among the rest the famous brazen bull, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHALARIS\">Phalaris</a> had ordered to be cast, and used as the chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of his cruelty, was restored to the inhabitants of Agrigentum. As \u00c6milianus was greatly inclined to spare what remained of this lately metropolis, he wrote to the senate on the subject, from whom he received the following orders: 1. The city of Carthage, with Byrsa and Megalia, shall be entirely destroyed, and no traces of them left. 2. All the cities that have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> Carthage any assistance shall be dismantled. 3. The territories of those cities which have declared for the Romans shall be enlarged with lands taken from the enemy. 4. All the lands between Hippo and Carthage shall be divided among the inhabitants of Utica. 5. All the Africans of the Carthaginian state, both men and women, shall pay an annual tribute to the Romans at so much per head. 6. The whole country, which was subject to the Carthaginian state, shall be turned into a Roman province, and be governed by a praetor, in the same manner as Sicily. Lastly, Rome shall send commissioners into Africa, there to settle jointly with the proconsul the state of the new province. Before \u00c6milianus destroyed the city, he performed these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> ceremonies which were required on such occasions: he first sacrificed to the gods, and then caused a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a> to be drawn round the walls of the city. After this, the towers, ramparts, walls, and all the works which the Carthaginians had raised in the course of many ages, and at vast expense, were levelled with the ground; and lastly, fire was set to the edifices of the proud metropolis, which consumed them all, not a single house escaping the flames. Though the fire began in all quarters at the same time, and burnt with incredible fury, it continued for 17 days before all the buildings were consumed.\n\nThus fell Carthage, about 146 years before the birth of Christ; a city whose destruction ought to be attributed more to the intrigues of an abandoned faction, composed of the most profligate part of its citizens, than to the power of its rival. The treasure which \u00c6milianus carried off, even after the city had been delivered up to be plundered by the soldiers, was immense, Pliny making it to amount to 4,470,000 pounds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of silver. The Romans ordered Carthage never to be inhabited again, denouncing dreadful imprecations against those who, contrary to this prohibition, should attempt to rebuild any part of it, especially Byrsa and Megalia. Notwithstanding this, however, about 24 years after, C. Gracchus, tribune of the people, in order to ingratiate himself with them, undertook to rebuild it; and, to that end conducted thither a colony of 6000 Roman citizens. The workmen, according to Plutarch, were terrified by many unlucky omens at the time they were tracing the limits and laying the foundations of the new city; which the senate being informed of, would have suspended the attempt. But the tribune, little affected with such preludes, continued to carry on the work, and finished it in a few days. From hence it is probable that only a slight kind of huts were erected; but whether Gracchus executed his design, or the work was entirely discontinued, it is certain that Carthage was the first Roman colony ever sent out of Italy. According to some authors, Carthage was rebuilt by Julius Caesar; and Strabo, who flourished in the reign of Tiberius, affirms it in his time to have been equal, if not superior, to any other city in Africa. It was looked upon as the capital of Africa for several centuries after the commencement of the Christian era. Maxentius laid it in ashes about the fifth or seventh year of Constantine's reign. Genseric, king of the Vandals, took it A.D. 439; but about a century afterwards it was re-annexed to the Roman empire by the renowned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELISARIUS\">Belisarius</a>. At last the Saracens, under Mohammed's successor, towards the close of the seventh century, destroyed it completely destroyed it, that there are now scarce any traces remaining.\n\nAt the commencement of the third Punic war, Carthage appears to have been one of the first cities in the world.\u2014It was seated on a peninsula 260 stadia or 180 ancient miles in circumference, joined to the continent by an isthmus 23 stadia or three miles and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FURLONG\">furlong</a> in breadth. On the west side there projected from it a long tract of land half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STADIUM\">stadium</a> broad; which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> out into the sea, separated it from a lake or morass, and was strongly fortified on all sides by rocks and a single wall. In the middle of the city stood the citadel of Byrsa, having on the top of it a temple sacred to \u00c6sculapius, seated upon rocks on a very high hill, to which the ascent was by 60 steps. On the south side the city was surrounded by a triple wall, 30 cubits high; flanked all round by parapets and towers, placed at equal distances of 480 feet. Every tower had its foundation sunk 32 feet deep, and was four stories high, though the walls were but two: they were arched; and, in the lower part, corresponding in depth with the foundation above-mentioned, were stalls large enough to hold 300 elephants, with their fodder, &c. Over these were stalls and other conveniences for 4000 horses; and there was likewise room for lodging 20,000 foot and 4000 cavalry, without\nCarthage, in the least incommending the inhabitants. There were two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>, so disposed as to have a communication with one another. They had one common entrance 70 feet broad, and shut up with chains. The first was appropriated to the merchants; and included in it a vast number of places of refreshment, and all kinds of accommodation for seamen. The second, as well as the island of Cothon, in the midst of it, was lined with large quays, in which were distinct receptacles for securing and sheltering from the weather 220 ships of war. Over these were magazines of all sorts of naval stores. The entrance into each of these receptacles was adorned with two marble pillars of the Ionic order; so that both the harbour and island represented on each side two magnificent galleries. Near this island was a temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a>, in which was a statue of the god all of massy gold; and the inside of the temple all lined with plates of the same metal, weighing 1000 talents. The city was 23 miles in circumference, and at the time we speak of contained 700,000 inhabitants. Of their power we may have some idea, by the quantity of arms they delivered up to the Roman consuls. The whole army was astonished at the long train of carts loaded with them, which were thought sufficient to have armed all Africa. At least it is certain, that on this occasion were put into the hands of the Romans 2000 catapults, 200,000 complete suits of armour, with an innumerable quantity of swords, darts, javelins, arrows, and beams armed with iron, which were thrown from the ramparts by the balistre.\n\nThe character transmitted of the Carthaginians is extremely bad; but we have it only on the authority of the Romans, who being their implacable enemies, cannot be much relied upon. As to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, manners, &c., being much the same with the Phoenicians, of which they were a colony, the reader is referred for an account of these things to the article PHOENICIA.\n\nOn the ruins of Carthage there now stands only a small village called Melcha. The few remains of Carthage consist only of some fragments of walls and 17 cisterns for the reception of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> water.\n\nThere are three eminences, which are so many masses of fine marbles pounded together, and were in all probability the sites of temples and other distinguished buildings. The present ruins are by no means the remains of the ancient city destroyed by the Romans; who after taking it entirely, razed it, and ploughed up the very foundations: so truly they adhered to the well-known advice perpetually inculcated by Cato the Elder, Delenda est Carthago. It was again rebuilt by the Gracchi family, who conducted a colony to repopulate it; and continually increasing in splendour, it became at length the capital of Africa under the Roman emperors. It subsisted near 700 years after its first demolition, until it was entirely destroyed by the Saracens in the beginning of the 7th century.\n\nIt is a singular circumstance that the two cities of Carthage and Rome should have been built just opposite one to the other; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of Tunis and the mouth of the Tiber being in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> line.\n\nLittora litoribus contraria, fluctibus undarum,\nArma armis.

The capital city, called likewise Carthagena, is situated in W. Long. 77. N. Lat. 11. on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> island, by most writers called a peninsula; which forming a narrow passage on the south-west, opens a communication with that called Tierra Bomba, as far as Bocca Chica. The little island which now joins them was formerly the entrance of the bay; but it having been filled up by orders of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, Bocca Chica became the only entrance: this, however, has been filled up since the attempt of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VERNON\">Vernon</a> and Wentworth, and the old passage again opened. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> side the land is so narrow, that, before the wall was begun, the distance from sea to sea was only 35 toises; but afterwards enlarging, it forms another island on this side; so that, excepting those two places, the whole city is entirely surrounded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> water. To the eastward it has a communication, by means of a wooden bridge, with a large suburb called Xemani, built on another island, which is also joined to the continent by a bridge of the same materials. The fortifications both of the city and suburbs are built after the modern manner, and lined with freestone; and, in time of peace, the garrison consists of ten companies of 77 men each, besides militia. The city and suburbs are well laid out, the streets straight, broad, uniform, and well paved. All the houses are built of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> or brick, only one story high, well contrived, neat, and furnished with balconies and lattices of wood, which is more durable in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> than iron, the latter being soon corroded by the acrimonious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. The climate is exceedingly unhealthy. The Europeans are particularly subject to the terrible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> called the black vomit, which sweeps off multitudes annually on the arrival of the galleons. It seldom continues above three or four days; in which time the patient is either dead or out of danger, and if he recovers, is never subject to a return of the same distemper.\n\nThis disease has hitherto foiled all the art of the Spanish physicians; as has also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEPROSY\">leprosy</a>, which is very common here. At Carthagena, likewise, that painful tumour in the legs, occasioned by the entrance of the Dracunculus or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUINEA\">Guinea</a>-worm, is very common and troublesome. Another disorder peculiar to this country, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a>, is occasioned by a little insect called Nigua, so extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> as scarce to be visible to the naked eye. This insect breeds in the dust, infuses itself into the foles of the feet and the legs, piercing the skin with such subtlety, that there is no being aware of it, before it has made its way to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>. If it is perceived in the beginning, it is extracted with little pain; but having once lodged its head, and pierced the skin, the patient must undergo the pain of an incision, without which a nidus would be formed, and a multitude of insects engendered, which would soon overspread the foot and leg. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of the nigua is venomous; and when it enters the toe, an inflammatory swelling, greatly resembling a venereal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUBO\">bubo</a>, takes place in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROIN\">groin</a>.\n\nCarthagena, a sea port town of Spain, in the kingdom\nCarthamus kingdom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURCIA\">Murcia</a>, and capital of a territory of the same name; built by Aldrubar, a Carthaginian general, and named after Carthage.

The carthamus tinctorius is at present cultivated in many parts of Europe, and also in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVANT\">Levant</a>, from whence great quantities of it are annually imported into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> for the purposes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYEING\">dyeing</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>. The good quality of this commodity is in the colour, which is of a bright saffron hue: and in this the British carthamus very often fails; for if there happens much rain during the time the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> are in flower, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> change to a dark or dirty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, as they likewise do if the flowers are gathered with any moisture remaining upon them.\u2014The seeds of carthamus have been celebrated as a cathartic; but they operate very slowly, and for the most part disorder the stomach and bowels, especially when given in substance: triturated with distilled aromatic waters, they form an emulsion less offensive, yet inferior in efficacy to the more common purgatives.

See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">Botany</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>.\n\nThe caryophyllus aromaticus is a native of the Molucca <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, particularly of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBOYNA\">Amboyna</a>, where it is principally cultivated. The clove tree resembles, in its bark the olive, and is about the height of the laurel, which it also resembles in its leaves. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> verdure is ever seen under it. It has a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of branches, at the extremities of which are produced vast quantities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, that are first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, then green, and at last pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> and hard. When they arrive at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of maturity, they are, properly speaking, cloves. As they dry, they assume a dark yellowish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>; and when gathered, become of a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>. The season for gathering the cloves is from October to February. The boughs of the trees are then strongly shaken, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the cloves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> reeds. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">Large</a> cloths are spread to receive them, and they are afterwards either dried in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> or in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> of the bamboo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANE\">cane</a>. The cloves which escape the notice of those who gather them, or are purposely left upon the tree, continue to grow till they are about an inch in thickness; and these falling off, produce new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, which do not bear in less than eight or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> years. Those which are called mother cloves are inferior to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> sort; but are preferred in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> by the Dutch; and in long voyages, eaten after their meals, to promote digestion.\n\nThe clove, to be in perfection, must be full sized, heavy, oily, and easily broken; of a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, and of a hot aromatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, so as almost to burn the throat. It should make the fingers smart when handled, and leave an oily moisture upon them when pressed. In the East Indies, and in some parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, it is so much admired as to be thought an indispensible ingredient in almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISH\">dish</a>. It is put into their food, liquors, wines, and enters likewise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of their perfumes. Considered as medicines, cloves are very hot stimulating aromatics, and possess in an eminent degree the general virtues of substances of this class. Their pungency resides in their resin; or rather in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of resin with essential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>; for the spirituous extract is very pungent; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the oil and the resin contained in this extract are separated from each other by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a>, the oil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be very mild; and any pungency which it does retain, proceeds from some small portion of adhering resin, and the remaining resin will be insipid. No plant, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of any plant, contains such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of oil as cloves do. From 16 ounces Newman obtained by distillation two ounces and two drachms, and Hoffmann obtained an ounce and a half of oil from two ounces of the spice. The oil is specifically heavier than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. Cloves acquire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> by imbibing water; and this they will do at some considerable distance. The Dutch, who trade in cloves, make a considerable advantage by knowing this secret. They sell them always by weight; and when a bag of cloves is ordered, they hang it, for several hours before it is sent in, over a vessel of water, at about two feet distance from the surface. This will add many pounds to the weight, which the unwary purchaser pays for on the spot. This is sometimes practised in Europe, as well as in the Spice Islands; but the degree of moisture must be more carefully watched in the latter; for there a bag of cloves will, in one night's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, attract so much water, that it may be pressed out of them by squeezing, them with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>.\n\nThe clove tree is never cultivated in Europe. At Amboyna the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a> have allotted the inhabitants 4000 parcels of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, on each of which they were at first allowed, and about the year 1720 compelled, to plant about 125 trees, amounting in all to 500,000.

Though inconsiderable as to its revenues, it was uniformly held in the highest estimation by the emperors of Hindoostan. Thither they repaired in the plenitude of their greatness, when the affairs of state would admit of their absence; and there they divested themselves of form and all the oppressive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> of state. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> manner of travelling to Cashmire was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a>, though tedious and unwieldy, and showed, in an eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, the splendour and magnificence of an eastern potentate.

Though he justly attained the character of being the Coryphaeus in that employment, he was not brought up to the business; and it is observed by Mr Mores, that this handiwork is so concealed among the artificers of it, that he could not discover that any one had taught it to another, but every person who had used it had learned it of his own genuine inclination. Mr Caslon served a regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPRENTICESHIP\">apprenticeship</a> to an engraver of ornaments on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUN\">gun</a> barrels; and after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, carried on this trade in Vine-street, near the Minories. He did not, however, solely confine his ingenuity to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, but employed himself likewise in making tools for the bookbinders, and for the chiselling of silver-plate. Whilst he was engaged in this business, the elder Mr Bowyer accidentally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>, in a bookbinder's shop, the lettering of a book uncommonly neat; and inquiring who the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> was by whom the letters were made, was hence induced to seek an acquaintance with Mr Caslon. Not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> after, Mr Bowyer took Mr Caslon to Mr James's foundery, in Bartholomew-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>. Caslon had never before that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> seen any part of the business; and being asked by his friend, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he thought he could undertake to cut types, he requested a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> to consider the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>; and then replied that he had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> doubt but he could. Upon this answer, Mr Bowyer, Mr Bettenham, and Mr Watts, had such a confidence in his abilities, that they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> him \u00a3500 to begin the undertaking, and he applied himself to it with equal assiduity and success. In 1720, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> for promoting Christian knowledge, in consequence of a representation from Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a> Negri, a native of Damascus in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, who was well skilled in the Oriental tongues, and had been professor of Arabic in places of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, deemed it expedient to print, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the Eastern churches, the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a> and Psalter, in the Arabic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. These were intended for the benefit of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a>, Syria, Mesopotamia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of which countries did not permit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a>. Upon this occasion Mr Caslon was pitched upon to cut the font; in his specimens of which he distinguished it by the name of English Arabic. Under the farther encouragement of Mr Bowyer, Mr Bettenham, and Mr Watts, he proceeded with vigour in his employment; and he arrived at length to such perfection, that he not only freed us from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of importing types from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, but in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and elegance of those made by him he so far exceeded the productions of the best artificers, that his workmanship was frequently exported to the continent. In short, his foundery became, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time, the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> one that existed in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> in foreign countries.

It is upwards of 400 miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> from south to north, and 300 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> from east to west. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> forms several gulfs, and embraces between Astrakhan and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASTRABAD\">Astrabad</a> an incredible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>. Its bottom is mud, but sometimes mixed with shells. At the distance of some German miles from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> it is 50 fathoms deep; but on approaching the shore it is everywhere so shallow, that the smallest vessels, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> loaded, are obliged to remain at a distance.\n\nWhen we consider that the Caspian is enclosed on all sides by land, and that its banks are in the neighbourhood of very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, we easily see why the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> in it should be perfectly different from that in every other sea. There are certain winds that dominate over it with such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> sway, that vessels are often deprived of every resource; and in the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of it there is not a port that can truly be called safe. The north, north-east, and east winds, blow most frequently, and occasion the most violent tempests. Along the eastern shore the east winds prevail; for which reason vessels bound from Persia to Astrakhan always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> their course along this shore.\n\nThe surface of the Caspian sea is lower than the ocean. Although its extent is immense, the variety of its productions is exceedingly small. This undoubtedly proceeds from its want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with the ocean, which cannot impart to it any portion of its inexhaustible stores. But the animals which this lake nourishes multiply to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, that the Russians, who alone are in condition to make them turn to account, justly consider them as a never-failing source of profit and wealth. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be understood that we speak of the fish of the Caspian, and of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a>, which make the sole occupation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> trade of the people inhabiting the banks of the Wolga and of the Jaik. This business is distinguished into the great and lesser fisheries. The fish comprehended under the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, such as the sturgeon and others, abound in all parts of the Caspian as well as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> that communicate with it, and which they ascend at spawning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. The small fishes, such as the salmon and many others, observe the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of quitting the salt waters for the fresh; nor is there an instance of one of them remaining constantly in the sea.\n\nSeals are the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a> that inhabit the Caspian; but they are there in such numbers as to afford the means of subsistence to many people in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> as well as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENLAND\">Greenland</a>. The varieties of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> are numerous, diversified, however, only by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. Some are quite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, others quite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>; there are some whitish, some yellowish, some of a mouse colour, and some streaked like a tiger. They crawl by means of their fore feet upon the islands, where they become the prey of the fishermen, who kill them.\nCaspian sea. As soon as one is despatched, he is succeeded by several who come to the assistance of their unhappy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>, but come only to share his fate. They are exceedingly tenacious of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, and endure more than thirty hard blows before they die. They will even live for several days after having received many mortal wounds. They are most terrified by fire and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>; and as soon as they perceive them, retreat with the utmost expedition to the sea. These animals grow so very fat, that they look rather like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> bags than animals. At Astrakhan is made a sort of gray <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a> with their fat mixed with pot-ashes, which is much valued for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of cleansing and taking grease from woollen stuffs. The greatest numbers of them are killed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> and autumn. Many small vessels go from Astrakhan merely to catch seals.\n\nIf the Caspian has few quadrupeds, it has in proportion still fewer of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> productions which are looked upon as proper only to the sea. There have never been found in it any zoophytes, nor any animal of the order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOLLUSCA\">mollusca</a>. The same may almost be said of shells; the only ones found being three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> four species of cockle, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> mussels, some species of snails, and one or two others.\n\nBut to compensate this sterility, it abounds in birds of different kinds. Of those that frequent the shores there are many species of the goose and duck kind, of the stork and heron, and many others of the wader <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>. Of birds properly aquatic, it contains the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GREBE\">grebe</a>, the crested diver, the pelican, the cormorant, and almost every species of gull. Crows are so fond of fish, that they haunt the shores of the Caspian in prodigious multitudes.\n\nThe waters of this lake are very impure, the great number of rivers that run into it, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of its bottom, affecting it greatly. It is true, that in general the waters are salt; but though the whole western shore extends from the 46th to the 35th degree of north latitude; and though one might conclude from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> that these waters would contain a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of salt, yet experiments prove the contrary: and it is certain that the saltness of this sea is diminished by the north, north-east, and north-west winds; although we may with equal reason conclude, that it owes its saltness to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of salt which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> along its two banks, and which are either already known or will be known to posterity. The depth of these waters also diminishes gradually as you approach the shores, and their saltness in the same way grows less in proportion to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROXIMITY\">proximity</a> to the land; the north winds not unfrequently causing the rivers to discharge into it vast quantities of troubled water impregnated with clay. These variations which the sea is exposed to are more or less considerable according to the nature of the winds; they affect the colour of the river waters to a certain distance from the shore, till these mixing with those of the sea, which then resume the alendency, the fine green colour appears, which is natural to the ocean, and to all those bodies of water that communicate with it.\n\nIt is well known, that besides its salt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, all sea water has a sensible bitterness, which must be attributed not only to the salt itself, but to the mixture of different substances that unite with it, particularly to different sorts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>, the ordinary effect of different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>. Besides this, the waters of the Caspian have another taste, bitter too, but quite distinct, which affects the tongue with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> similar to that made by the bile of animals; a property which is peculiar to this sea, though not equally sensible at all seasons. When the north and north-west winds have raged for a considerable time, this bitter taste is sensibly felt; but when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> has been south, very imperfectly. We shall endeavour to account for this phenomenon.\n\nThe Caspian is surrounded on its western side by the mountains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAUCASUS\">Caucasus</a>, which extend from Derbent to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK_SEA\">Black sea</a>. These mountains make a curve near Astrakhan, and directing their course towards the eastern shore of the Caspian, lose themselves near the mouth of the Jaik, where they become secondary mountains, being disposed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a>. As Caucasus is an inexhaustible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">magazine</a> of combustible substances, it consequently lodges an affluing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> in its bowels. Accordingly, along the foot of this immense chain of mountains, we sometimes meet with warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>, sometimes springs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPHTHA\">naphtha</a> of different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>; sometimes we find native sulphur, mines of vitriol, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a> heated by internal fires. Now the foot of Mount Caucasus forming the immediate western shore of the Caspian sea, it is very easy to imagine that a great quantity of the constituent parts of the former must be communicated to the latter; but it is chiefly to the naphtha, which abounds so much in the countries which surround this sea, that we must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> the true cause of the bitterness peculiar to its waters; for it is certain that this bitumen flows from the mountains, sometimes in all its purity, and sometimes mixed with other substances which it acquires in its passage through subterranean channels, from the most interior parts of these mountains to the sea, where it falls to the bottom by its specific gravity. It is certain too, that the north and north-west winds detach the greatest quantities of this naphtha; whence it is evident that the bitter taste must be most sensible when these winds prevail. We may also comprehend why this taste is not so strong at the surface or in the neighbourhood of the shore, the waters there being less impregnated with salt, and the naphtha, which is united with the water by the salt, being then either carried to a distance by the winds, or precipitated to the bottom.\n\nBut it is not a bitter taste alone that the naphtha communicates to the waters of the Caspian: these waters were analyzed by M. Gmelin, and found to contain, besides the common sea salt, a considerable proportion of Glauber salt, intimately united with the former, and which is evidently a production of the naphtha.\n\nAs the waters of the Caspian have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> outlet, they are discharged by subterranean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, where they deposit beds of salt; the surface of which corresponds with that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the sea. The two great deserts which extend from it to the east and west are chiefly composed of a saline earth, in which the salt is formed by efflorescence into regular crystals; for which reason salt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> and dews are exceedingly common in that neighbourhood. The salt of the marshes at Astrakhan, and that found in efflorescence in the deserts, is by no means pure sea salt, but\nbut much debased by the bitter Glauber salt we mentioned above. In many places indeed it is found with crystals of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOZENGE\">lozenge</a> shape, which is peculiar to it, without any cubical appearance, the form peculiar to crystals of sea salt.\n\nA great deal has been written on the successive augmentation and decrease of the Caspian sea, but with little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. There is indeed to be perceived in it a certain rise and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of its waters; in which, however, no observation has ever discovered any regularity.\n\nMany suppose (and there are strong presumptions in favour of the supposition), that the shores of the Caspian were much more extensive in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> times than they are at present, and that it once communicated with the Black sea. It is probable too, that the level of this last sea was once much higher than it is at present. If then it be allowed, that the waters of the Black sea, before it procured an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXIT\">exit</a> by the straits of Constantinople, rose several fathoms above their present level, which from many concurring circumstances may easily be admitted, it will follow, that all the plains of the Crimea, of the Kuman, of the Wolga, and of the Jax, and those of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a> beyond the lake of Aral, in ancient times formed but one sea, which embraced the northern extremity of Caucasus by a narrow strait of little depth; the vestiges of which are still obvious in the river Mantyfch.","sp":246,"ep":248},{"h":"CASSANA","t":"Giovanni Agostino, called L'Abate Cassana, was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> to the preceding, and born in 1664.

His early proficiency in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a> procured him an invitation to be mathematical professor at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a> when he was no more than 15 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>; and a comet appearing in 1652, he discovered that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMETS\">comets</a> were not accidental meteors, but of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and probably governed by the same laws, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>. In the same year he solved a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> given up by Kepler and Bullialdus as insolvable, which was, to determine geometrically the apogee and eccentricity of a planet from its true and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> place. In 1663, he was appointed inspector general of the fortifications of the castle of Urbino, and had afterwards the care of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> state; he still however prosecuted his astronomical studies, by discovering the revolution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a> round its own axis; and, in 1666, published his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>'s satellites. Cassini was invited into France by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIV. in 1669, where he settled as the first professor in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">observatory</a>. In 1677 he demonstrated the line of Jupiter's diurnal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a>; and in 1684 discovered four more satellites belonging to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a>, Huygens having found one before. He inhabited the royal observatory at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> more than forty years; and when he died in 1712, was succeeded by his only son James Cassini.\n\nCassini, James, another celebrated astronomer, was the younger son of the former. He was born at Paris 18th February 1677. It would appear that his early studies were conducted in his father's house, where, from the pursuits and studies of his father, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, and their application to astronomy, it is probable, were not neglected. He became a student afterwards at the Mazarine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that the celebrated Vivignon was professor of mathematics. With the affluence of this eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> young Cassini made such progress, that at 15 years of age he supported a mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THESIS\">thesis</a> with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>. At the age of 17 he was admitted a member of the Academy of Sciences; and the same year he accompanied his father in a journey to Italy, where he assisted him in the verification of the meridian at Bologna and other measurements. After his return he performed similar operations in a journey into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, and he discovered some errors in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> by Snell, the result of which was communicated to the Academy in 1702. In 1696 he made also a visit to England, where he was made a member of the Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>. In 1712 he succeeded his father as astronomer royal at the observatory of Paris. In 1717 he gave to the Academy his researches on the distance of the fixed stars; in which he showed that the whole annual orbit, of near 200 millions of miles diameter, is but as a point in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of that distance. The same year he communicated also his discoveries concerning the inclination of the orbits of the satellites in general, and especially of those of Saturn's satellites and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a>. In 1725 he undertook to determine the cause of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>'s libration, by which she shows sometimes a little towards one side, and sometimes a little on the other, of that half which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> behind or hid from our view.\n\nIn 1732 an important question in astronomy enga-\nCassini, ged the ingenuity of our author. His father had determined, by his observations, that the planet Venus revolved about her axis in the space of 23 hours; and M. Bianchini had published a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> in 1729, in which he settled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of the same revolution at 24 days 8 hours. From an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of Bianchini's observations which were upon the spots in Venus, he discovered that he had intermitted his observations for the space of three hours, from which cause he had probably mistaken new spots for the old ones, and so had been led into the mistake. He also determined the nature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of Jupiter at half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> per year, and of that of the retardation of Saturn at two minutes per year; that these quantities would go on increasing for 2000 years, and then would decrease again. In 1740 he published his Astronomical Tables, and his Elements of Astronomy; very extensive and accurate works.\n\nAstronomy was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of our author's consideration, but he did not confine himself absolutely to that pursuit, but made occasional excursions into other fields. We owe to him Experiments on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">Electricity</a>, Experiments on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOIL\">Recoil</a> of Fire-arms; Researches on the Rise of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAROMETER\">Barometer</a> at different Heights; Reflections on the perfecting of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-BURNING_GLASSES\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">Burning</a>-glasses; and some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a>.\n\nOne of the most important objects of the French academy was the measurement of the earth. In 1669 Picard measured a little more than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of latitude to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of Paris; but as that extent appeared too small from which to conclude the whole circumference with sufficient accuracy, it was resolved to continue that measurement on the meridian of Paris to the north and the south, through the whole extent of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. Accordingly, in 1683, the late M. de la Hire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> that on the north side of Paris, and the older Cassini that on the south side. The latter was assisted in 1700 in the continuation of this operation by his son our author. The same work was farther continued by the same academicians; and, finally, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> left unfinished by De la Hire in the north was finished in 1718 by our author, with the late Maraldi, and De la Hire the younger.\n\nThese operations produced a considerable degree of precision. From this measured extent of five degrees, it appeared also, that the degrees were of different lengths in different parts of the meridian; and our author concluded, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> published for 1718, that they decreased more and more towards the pole, and that therefore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of the earth was that of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> spheroid, or having its axis longer than the equatorial diameter. He also measured the perpendicular to the same meridian, and compared the measured distance with the differences of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> as before determined by the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites: from which he concluded that the length of the degrees of longitude was smaller than it would be on a sphere, and that therefore again the figure of the earth was an oblong spheroid, contrary to the determination of Newton by the theory of gravity. Newton was indeed of all men the most adverse to controversy; but the other mathematicians in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> did not tamely submit to conclusions in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> opposition to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> doctrine of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> was, that the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> sent two different sets of measurers, the one to measure Cassini's degree at the equator, the other at the polar circle; and the comparison of the whole determined the figure to be an oblate spheroid, contrary to Cassini's determination.\n\nAfter a long and laborious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, James Cassini died in April 1756, and was succeeded in the Academy and Observatory by his second son. He published, A Treatise on the Magnitude and Figure of the Earth; as also, The Elements or Theory of the Planets, with Tables; beside a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of papers in the Memoirs of the Academy, from the year 1699 to 1755.\n\nCassini de Thury, C\u00e9sar Fran\u00e7ois, a celebrated French astronomer, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a> of the observatory, and member of most of the learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, was born at Paris <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 17, 1714. He was the second son of James Cassini, whose occupations and talents he inherited and supported with great honour. He received his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LESSONS\">lessons</a> in astronomy and mathematics from MM. Maraldi and Camus; and made such a rapid progress, that when he was not more than ten years of age he calculated the phases of a total eclipse of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>. At the age of eighteen he accompanied his father in his two journeys undertaken for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> the perpendicular to the observatory meridian from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STRASBOURG\">Strasbourg</a> to Brest. A general chart of France was from that time devised; for which purpose it was necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> the country by several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> and perpendicular to the meridian of Paris. Our author was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with the conduct of this business; in which he was so scrupulous as to measure again what had been measured by his father. This great work was published in 1740, with a chart shewing the new meridian of Paris, by two different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of triangles, passing along the sea coasts to Bayonne, traversing the frontiers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIBES\">Antibes</a>, and thence along the eastern limits of France to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUNKIRK\">Dunkirk</a>, with parallel and perpendicular lines described at the distance of 6000 toises from one another, from side to side of the country.\n\nOur author made a tour in 1741, in Flanders, in the train of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>. This gave rise, at his majesty's instance, to the chart of France; relative to which Cassini published different works, as well as a great number of the sheets of the chart itself. He undertook, in 1761, an expedition into Germany, for the purpose of continuing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a> the perpendicular of the Paris meridian; to unite the triangles of the chart of France with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> taken in Germany; to prepare the means of extending into that country the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> as in France; and thus to establish successively for all Europe a most useful uniformity.\u2014Our author was at Vienna the 6th of June 1761, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of the transit of the planet Venus over the sun, of which he observed as much as the state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> would permit him to do, and published the account of it in his Voyage en Allemagne.\n\nCassini, always meditating the perfection of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, profited of the peace of 1783 to propose the joining of certain points taken upon the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> with those which had been determined on the coast of France, and thus to connect the general chart of the latter with that of the British isles, as he had before united it with those of Flanders and Germany. The proposal was favourably received by the English government,\nBetween the years 1735 and 1770, M. Cassini published, in the volumes of Memoirs of the French Academy, a great number of pieces, consisting chiefly of astronomical observations and questions; among which are researches concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLAX\">parallax</a> of the sun, the moon, Mars, and Venus; on astronomical refractions, and the effect caused in their quantity and laws by the weather; numerous observations on the obliquity of the ecliptic, and on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of its variations. He cultivated astronomy for 50 years, the most important for that science that ever elapsed for the magnitude and variety of objects; and in which he commonly sustained a principal share.\n\nM. Cassini was of a very strong and vigorous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, which carried him through the many laborious operations in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a> and astronomy which he conducted. An habitual retention of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>, however, rendered the last twelve years of his life very painful and distressing, till it was at length terminated by the smallpox the 4th of September 1784, in the 71st year of his age. He was succeeded in the academy, and as director of the observatory, by his only son John-Dominic Cassini, the fourth in order of direct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> who has filled that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> station.

He also formed a library; and composed several works, the best edition of which is that of Father Garet, printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROUEN\">Rouen</a> in 1679. Those most esteemed are his Divine Institutions, and his Treatise on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">Soul</a>.

To appease the god, her daughter Andromeda was exposed to the monster, but was rescued by Perseus; who obtained of Jupiter, that Cassiopeia might be placed after her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> among the stars: hence the constellation of that name.\n\nCassiopeia, in Astronomy, one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTELLATIONS\">constellations</a> of the northern hemisphere, situated next to Cepheus. In 1572, there appeared a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a> in this constellation, which at first surpassed in magnitude and brightness Jupiter himself; but it diminished by degrees, and at last disappeared, at the end of eighteen months. It alarmed all the astronomers of that age, many of whom wrote dissertations on it; among the rest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TYCHO_BRAHE\">Tycho Brahe</a>, Kepler, Maurolycus, Lycetus, Gramineus, &c.

The extraordinary genius of Andrea became at last a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> topic of discourse in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a>; and so far excited the curiosity of Bernadetto de Medici, that he sent for Andrea: and perceiving that he had promising talents, he placed him under the care of the best masters who were at that time in Florence. Andrea diligently pursued his studies, devoted himself entirely to practice under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of his instructors, became particularly eminent in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, and in a few years made so great a progress, that he found as much employment as he could possibly execute. He painted only in tempera, and fresco, with a manner of colouring that was not very agreeable, being rather dry and hard, till he learned the secret of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> from Domenico Venetiano, who had derived his knowledge of that new discovery from Antonello da Messina. Andrea was the first of the Florentine artists who painted in oil; but although he was in the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> indebted to Domenico for disclosing the secret, yet he secretly envied the merit of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> who taught him the art; and because his own works seemed to be much less admired than those of Domenico, he determined to affront his friend and benefactor. He executed his design with the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INGRATITUDE\">ingratitude</a> and treachery (for Domenico at that time lived with him, and painted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTNERSHIP\">partnership</a> with him), and he stabbed him at a corner of a street so secretly, that he escaped, unobserved and unsuspected, to his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, where he composedly sat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to work; and thither Domenico was soon after conveyed, to die in the arms of his murderer.

As much plaster as will be sufficient to cover and rise to such a thickness as may give sufficient strength to the mould, as also to fill the hollow betwixt the frame and the model, must be moistened with water, till it be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> of such consistence as will allow it to be poured upon the model. This must be done as soon as possible; or the plaster would concrete or set, so as to become more troublesome in the working, or unfit to be used. The whole must then be suffered to remain in this condition, till the plaster has attained its hardness; and then the frame being taken away, the preparatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> or mould thus formed may be taken off from the subject entire.\n\nWhere the model or original subject is of a round or erect form, a different method must be pursued; and the mould must be divided into several pieces; or if the subject consists of detached and projecting parts, it is frequently most expedient to cast such parts separately, and afterwards join them together.\n\nWhere the original subject or mould forms a round, or spheroid, or any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of such round or spheroid, more than one half the plaster must be used without any frame to keep it round the model; and must be tempered with water to such a consistence, that it may be wrought with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> like very soft paste; but though it must not be so fluid as when prepared for flat-figured models, it must yet be as moist as is compatible with its cohering sufficiently to hold together; and being thus prepared, it must be put upon the model, and comprimbed with the hand, or any flat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, that the parts of it may adapt themselves, in the most perfect manner, to those of the subject, as well as to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> with respect to themselves. When the model is so covered to a convenient thickness, the whole must be left at rest till the plaster be set and firm, so as to bear dividing without falling to pieces, or being liable to be put out of its form by flight violence; and it must then be divided into pieces, in order to its being taken off from the model, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> it with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a> with a very thin blade; and being divided, must be cautiously taken off, and kept till dry; but it must be always carefully observed, before the separation of the parts be made, to notch them across the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, at proper distances, that they may with ease and certainty be properly joined again; which would be much more precarious and troublesome without such directive marks. The art of properly dividing the moulds, in order to make them separate from the model, requires more dexterity and skill than any other thing in the art of casting; and does not admit of rules for the most advantageous conduct of it in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. Where the subject is of a round or spheroidal form, it is best to divide the mould into three parts, which will then easily come off from the model; and the same will hold good of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> or any regular curved figure.\n\nThe mould being thus formed, and dry, and the parts put together, it must be first greased, and placed in such a position that the hollow may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> upwards, and then filled with plaster mixed with water, in the same proportion and manner as was directed for the casting the mould; and when the cast is perfectly set and dry, it must be taken out of the mould, and repaired where it is necessary; which finishes the operation.\n\nThis is all that is required with respect to subjects where the surfaces have the regularity above-mentioned; but where they form curves which intersect each other, the conduct of the operation must be varied with respect to the manner of taking the cast of\nthe mould from off the subject or model; and where there are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> projecting parts, such as legs or arms, they should be wrought in separate casts. The operator may easily judge, from the original subjects, what parts will come off together, and what require to be separated: the principle of the whole consists only in this, that where under-workings, as they are called, occur, that is, wherever a straight line drawn from the basis or insertion of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a>, would be cut or crossed by any part of such projection, such part cannot be taken off without a division; which must be made either in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where the projection would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> the straight line; or, as that is frequently difficult, the whole projection must be separated from the main body, and divided also lengthwise into two parts; and where there are no projections from the principal surfaces, but the body is so formed as to render the surface a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of such curves, that a straight line being drawn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the surface of one part would be cut by the outline, in one or more places, of another part, a division of the whole should be made, so as to reduce the parts of it into regular curves, which must then be treated as such.\n\nIn larger masses, where there would otherwise be a great thickness of the plaster, a core or body may be put within the mould, in order to produce a hollow in the cast; which both saves the expense of the plaster, and renders the cast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a>.\n\nThis core may be of wood, where the forming a hollow of a straight figure, or a conical one with the basis outward, will answer the end: but if the cavity require to be round, or of any curve figure, the core cannot be then drawn while entire; and consequently should be of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> as may be taken out piecemeal. In this case, the core is best formed of clay; which must be worked upon wires to give it a tenacity, and suspended in the hollow of the mould by cross wires lying over the mouth; and when the plaster is sufficiently set to bear handling, the clay must be picked out by a proper instrument.\n\nWhere it is desired to render the plaster harder, the water with which it is tempered should be mixed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARCHMENT\">parchment</a> size properly prepared, which will make it very firm and tenacious.\n\nIn the same manner, figures, busts, &c., may be cast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, or any other metal, in the moulds of plaster; only the expense of plaster, and the tediousness of its becoming sufficiently dry, when in a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, to bear the heat of melted metal, render the use of clay, compounded with some other proper materials, preferable where large subjects are in question. The clay, in this case, should be washed over till it be perfectly free from gravel or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>; and then mixed with a third or more of fine sand to prevent it cracking; or, instead of sand, coal ashes sifted fine may be used. Whether plaster or clay be employed for the casting in metal, it is extremely necessary to have the mould perfectly dry: otherwise the moisture, being rarefied, will make an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a> that will blow the metal out of the mould, and endanger the operator, or at least crack the mould in such a manner as to frustrate the operation. Where the parts of a mould are larger, or project much, and consequently require a greater tenacity of the matter they are formed of to keep them together, flocks of cloth, prepared like those designed for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> hangings, or fine cotton plucked or cut till it is very short, should be mixed with the ashes or sand before they are added to the clay to make the composition for the mould. The proportion should be according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> required; but a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> will answer the end, if the other ingredient of the composition be good, and the parts of the mould properly linked together by means of the wires above directed.\n\nThere is a method of taking casts in metals from small animals, and the parts of vegetables, which may be practised for some purposes with advantage: particularly for the decorating grottoes or rock work, where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> is imitated. The proper kinds of animals are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIZARDS\">lizards</a>, snakes, frogs, birds, or insects; the casts of which, if properly coloured, will be exact representations of the originals.\n\nThis is to be performed by the following method. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COFFIN\">coffin</a> or proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a> for forming the mould being prepared of clay, or four pieces of boards fixed together, the animal or parts of vegetables must be suspended in it by a string; and the leaves, tendrils or other detached parts of the vegetables, or the legs, wings, &c., of the animals, properly separated and adjusted, in their right position by a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of pincers: a due quantity of plaster of Paris and calcined tallow, in equal quantities, with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> arabic, must then be tempered with water to the proper consistence for casting; and the subject from whence the cast is to be taken, also the sides of the coffin, moistened with spirit of wine. The coffin or chest must then be filled with the tempered composition of the plaster and tallow, putting at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> a piece of straight stick or wood to the principal part of the body of the subject, and pieces of thick wire to the extremities of the other parts, in order that they may form, when drawn out after the matter of the mould is properly set and firm, a channel for pouring in the melted metal, and vents for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; which otherwise by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a> it would undergo from the heat of the metal would blow it out or burst the mould. In a short time the plaster and tallow will set and become hard, when the stick and wires may be drawn out, and the frame or coffin in which the mould was cast taken away; and the mould must then be put first into a moderate heat, and afterwards, when it is as dry as it can be rendered by that degree, removed into a greater; which may be gradually increased till the whole be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> hot. The animal or part of any vegetable, which was included in the mould, will then be burnt to a coal; and may be totally calcined to ashes, by blowing for some time gently into the channel and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> made for pouring in the metal, and giving vent to the air, which will, at the same time that it destroys the remainder of the animal or vegetable matter, blow out the ashes. The mould must then be suffered to cool gently; and will be perfect; the destruction of the substance of the animal or vegetable having produced a hollow of a figure correspondent to it; but it may be nevertheless proper to shake the mould, and turn it upside <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, as also to blow with the bellows into each of the air vents, in order to free it wholly from any remainder of the ashes; or where there may be an opportunity of filling the hollow with quicksilver without expense, it will be found a very effectual method of clearing the cavity, as all dust, ashes, or small detached bodies, will necessarily\nCasting necessarily rise to the surface of the quicksilver, and be poured out with it. The mould being thus prepared, it must be heated very hot when used, if the cast be made with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>; but a less degree will serve for lead or tin; and the matter being poured in, the mould must be gently struck; and then suffered to rest till it be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>; at which time it must be carefully taken from the cast, but without the least force; for such parts of the matter as appear to adhere more strongly, must be softened by soaking in water till they be entirely loosened, that none of the more delicate parts of the cast may be broken off or bent.\n\nWhere the alumen plumbosum, or talk, cannot easily be procured, the plaster may be used alone; but it is apt to be calcined by the heat used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> the animal or vegetable from whence the cast is taken, and to become too incohering and crumbly texture; or, for cheapness, Sturbridge or any other good clay, washed over, till it be perfectly fine, and mixed with an equal part of sand, and some flours cut small, may be employed. Pounded pumice <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> and plaster of Paris, taken in equal quantities, and mixed with washed clay in the same proportion, is said to make excellent moulds for this and parallel uses.\n\nCasts of medals, or such small pieces as are of a similar form, may be made in plaster by the method directed for bas relieves.\n\nIndeed there is nothing more required than to form a mould by laying them on a proper board, and having surrounded them by a rim made by the piece of a card or any other pastebone, to fill the rim with soft tempered plaster of Paris; which mould, when dry, will serve for several casts. It is nevertheless a better method to form the mould of melted sulphur; which will produce a sharper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> in the cast, and be more durable than those made of plaster.\n\nThe casts are likewise frequently made of sulphur, which being melted must be treated exactly in the same manner as the plaster.\n\nFor taking casts from medals, Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEWIS\">Lewis</a> recommends a mixture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> of brimstone and red lead: equal parts of these are to be put over the fire in a ladle, till they soften to the consistence of pap; then they are kindled with a piece of paper, and stirred for some time. The vessel being afterwards covered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> on the fire, the mixture grows fluid in a few minutes. It is then to be poured on the metal, previously oiled and wiped clean. The casts are very neat; their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> sometimes a pretty deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, sometimes a dark grey; they are very durable; and when soiled, may be washed clean in spirits of wine.\n\nDr Lettfrom recommends tin foil for taking off casts from medals. The thinnest kind is to be used. It should be laid over the subject from which the impression is to be taken, and then rubbed with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>, the point of a skewer, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a>, till it has perfectly received the impression. The tin foil should now be prepared close to the edge of the medal, till it is brought to the same circumference: the medal must then be reversed, and the tin foil will drop off into a chip box or mould placed ready to receive it. Thus the concave side of the foil will be uppermost, and upon this plaster of Paris, prepared in the usual manner, may be poured. When dry, the whole is to be taken out, and the tin foil sticking on the plaster will give a perfect representation of the medal, almost equal in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> to silver. If the box or mould is a little larger than the medal, the plaster running round the tin foil will give the appearance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> frame or circular border; whence the new made medal will appear more neat and beautiful.\n\nCasts may be made likewise with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, prepared in the following manner: \"Take any iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>, or piece of a similar form; and having heated it red-hot, hold it over a vessel containing water, and touch it very slightly with a roll of sulphur, which will immediately dissolve it, and make it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> in drops into the water. As much iron as may be wanted being thus dissolved, pour the water out of the vessel; and pick out the drops formed by the melted iron from those of the sulphur, which contain little or no iron, and will be distinguishable from the other by their colour and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>.\" The iron will, by this means, be rendered so fusible, that it will run with less heat than is required to melt lead; and may be employed for making casts of medals, and many other such purposes, with great convenience and advantage.\n\nImpressions of medals, having the same effect as casts, may be made also of isinglass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLUE\">glue</a>, by the following means. Melt the isinglass, beaten, as when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> used, in an earthen pipkin, with the addition of as much water as will cover it, stirring it gently till the whole is dissolved; then with a brush of camel's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, cover the medal, which should be previously well cleaned and warmed, and then laid horizontally on a board or table, greased in the part around the medal. Let them rest afterwards till the glue be properly hardened; and then, with a pin, raise the edge of it; and separate it carefully from the medal: the cast will be thus formed by the glue as hard as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>; and so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, that a thousand will scarcely weigh an ounce. In order to render the relief of the medal more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>, a small quantity of carmine may be mixed with the melted isinglass; or the medal may be previously coated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> by breathing on it, and then laying it on the leaf, which will by that means adhere to it; but the use of leaf gold is apt to impair a little the sharpness of the impression.\n\nImpressions of medals may be likewise taken in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTTY\">putty</a>; but it should be the true kind made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALX\">calx</a> of tin, and drying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>. These may be formed in the moulds, previously taken in plaster or sulphur; or moulds may be made in its own substance, in the manner directed for those of the plaster. These impressions will be very sharp and hard; but the greatest disadvantage that attends them, is their drying very slowly, and being liable in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time to be damaged.\n\nImpressions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a>, or other engravings, may be taken from copperplates, by cleansing them thoroughly, and pouring plaster upon them; but the effect in this way is not strong enough for the eyes; and therefore the following method is preferable, where such impressions on plaster are desired.\n\nTake <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMILION\">vermilion</a>, or any other coloured pigment, finely powdered, and rub it over the plate; then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> a folded piece of paper, or the flat part of the hand, over the\nthe plate, to take off the colour from the lights or parts where there is no engraving; the proceeding must then be the same as where no colour is used. This last method is also applicable to the making of impressions of copperplates on paper with dry colours; for the plate being prepared as here directed, and laid on the paper properly moistened, and either passed under the rolling press, or any other way strongly forced down on the paper, an impression of the engraving will be obtained.\n\nImpressions may be likewise taken from copperplates, either on plaster or paper, by means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>; if, instead of rubbing them with any colour, the plate be held over the candle or lamp till the whole surface become black, and then wiped off by the flat of the hand, or paper.\n\nThese methods are not, however, of great use in the case of copperplates, except where impressions may be desired on occasions where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INK\">ink</a> cannot be procured; but as they may be applied likewise to the taking impressions from snuff boxes, or other engraved subjects, by which means designs may be instantly borrowed by artists or curious persons, they may in such instances be very useful.\n\nThe expedient of taking impressions by the smoke of a candle or lamp may be employed also for botanical purposes in the case of leaves, as a perfect and durable representation of not only the general figure, but the contexture and disposition of the larger fibres, may be contemporaneously obtained at any time. The same may be nevertheless done in a more perfect manner, by the use of linseed oil, either alone, or mixed with a small proportion of colour, where the oil can be conveniently procured: but the other method is valuable on account of its being applicable at almost all seasons, and in all places, within the time that the leaves will keep fresh and plump. In taking these impressions it is proper to bruise the leaves, so as to take off the projections of the large ribs, which might prevent the other parts from plying to the paper.\n\nLeaves, as also the petals, or flower leaves, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, may themselves be preserved on paper, with their original appearance, for a considerable length of time, by the following means.\u2014Take a piece of paper, and rub it over with shellac glue treated as above directed for taking impressions from medals; and then lay the leaves in a proper position on the paper. The glue laid on the paper being let, brush over the leaves with more of the same; and that being dry likewise, the operation will be finished, and the leaves so secured from the air and moisture, that they will retain their figure and colour much longer than by any other treatment.\n\nButterflies, or other small animals of a flat figure, may also be preserved in the same manner.\n\nCasting is also sometimes used for the quitting, laying, or throwing aside any thing; thus deer cast their horns, snakes their skins, lobsters their shells, hawks their feathers, &c. annually.\n\nCasting of feathers is more properly called moulting or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEWING\">mewing</a>.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> casts his hair, or coat, at least once a year, viz. in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, when he casts his winter coat; and sometimes, at the close of autumn, he casts his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> coat, in case he has been ill kept. Horses also sometimes cast their hoofs, which happens frequently to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COACH\">coach</a> horses brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>; these being bred in a moist marshy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, have their hoofs too flabby; so that coming into a drier <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, and less juicy provender, their hoofs fall off, and others that are firmer succeed.\n\nCasting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLT\">Colt</a>, denotes a mare's proving abortive.\n\nCasting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">Net</a>, a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> net, so called, because it is to be cast or thrown out; which when exactly done, nothing escapes it, but weeds and every thing within its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> are brought away.","sp":255,"ep":258},{"h":"CASTLE","t":"Edmund.** See CASTEL.\n\n**CASTLE-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">BAR</a>,** a borough and market town, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of Mayo in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, is a well-inhabited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and carries on a brisk trade: it has a barrack for a troop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>; and there is here a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a> school capable of receiving 50 children, and endowed with two acres of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, rent free, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Lucan, who has also granted a lease of 20 acres more at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a> corn yearly.\n\n**CASTLE-CARY,** a remarkable Roman station about four miles west from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALKIRK\">Falkirk</a> on the borders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STIRLINGSHIRE\">Stirlingshire</a> in Scotland.

From that impregnated by Jupiter proceeded Pollux and Helena, who were both immortal: from the other Castor and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLYTEMNESTRA\">Clytemnestra</a>, who being begot by Tyndarus were both mortal. They were all, however, called by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> name of Tyndaridae. These two brothers entered into an inviolable friendship; they went with the other noble youths of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> in the expedition to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLCHIS\">Colchis</a>, and, on several occasions, signalized themselves by their courage; but Castor being at length killed, Pollux obtained leave to share his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a> with him; so that they are said to live and die alternately every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>: for, being translated into the skies, they form the constellation of Gemini, one of which stars rises as the other sets.\n\nA martial dance, called the Pyrrhic or Caistorian dance, was invented in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of those deities, whom the Cephelenes placed among the Dii Magni, and offered to them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMBS\">lambs</a>.

Castor and Pollux are called by the Spaniards, San Elmo; by the French St. Elme, St Nicholas, St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLARE\">Clare</a>, St Helene; by the Italians, Heremo; by the Dutch, Tree Vuuren.\n\nCastor and Pollux are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> judged to portend a cessation of the storm, and a future calm; being rarely seen till the tempest is nigh spent.

The best sort of castor is what comes from Ruffia. So much is Rufian castor superior to the American, that two guineas per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> are paid for the former, and only 8s. 6d. for the latter. The Ruffian castor is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> hard round cods, which appear, when cut, full of a brittle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> coloured substance, interperforated with membranes and fibres exquisitely interwoven. An inferior sort is brought from Dantzig, and is generally fat and moist. The American calior, which is the worst of all, is in longish thin cods. Ruffia castor has a strong disagreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>; and an acrid, bitterish, and nauseous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">Water</a> extracts the nauseous part, with little of the finer bitter; rectified spirit extracts this last without much of the nauseous; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> spirit both: water elevates the whole of its flavour in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a>; rectified spirit brings over nothing.

Cicuta and other poisonous herbs do the same office, as is shown by Paulus Aegineta. Those eunuched in this manner are called thlibia. Besides which there is another sort called thlofia, in whom the genitals are left entire, and only the veins which should feed them are cut; by which means the parts do indeed remain, but so lax and weak, as to be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> use.\n\nCastration was for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADULTERY\">adultery</a>.

The offence of Mayhem by castration is, according to all our old writers, felony; though committed upon the highest provocation. See a record to this purpose of Henry III. transcribed by Sir Edward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COKE\">Coke</a>, 3 Inst. 62. or Blackstone's Commentaries, vol. iv. p. 266.\n\nCastration is sometimes found necessary on medicinal considerations, as in mortifications, and some other diseases of the testicles, especially the farcocele and varicocele. Some have also used it in maniac <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>.\n\nCastration is also in some fort practised on women. Athenaeus mentions that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> Andromytes was the first who castrated women. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HESYCHIUS\">Hesychius</a> and Suidas say Gygges did the same thing. Galen observes, that women cannot be castrated without danger of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; and Dalechampius, on the fore-mentioned passage of Athenaeus, holds, that it is only to be understood of simple padding.\n\nCastration, in respect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a>, is called gelding and spaying.","sp":262,"ep":262},{"h":"CASTRATION ALSO","t":"n also denotes the art of retrenching, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> away any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a thing from its whole.\u2014Castrating a book, among bookellers, is the taking out some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>, sheet, or the like, which renders it imperfect and unfit for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>.

The castration of plants consists in cutting off the antherae, or tops of the stamens, before they have attained maturity, and dispersed the pollen or fine dust contained within their substance. This operation has been frequently practised by the moderns, with a view to establish or confute the doctrine of the sexes of plants; the antherae or tops being considered by the sexualists as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> organs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>. The experiment of castration succeeds principally on plants which, like the melon, have their male <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> detached from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a>. In such as have both male and female flowers contained within the same covers, this operation cannot be easily performed without endangering the neighbouring organs. The result of experiments on this subject by Linn\u00e6us, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTON\">Alton</a>, and other eminent botanists, may be seen under the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">Botany</a>.","sp":262,"ep":262},{"h":"CASTREL","t":"a kind of hawk resembling the lanner in shape, but the hobby in size.

The lady having no children, she resolved to bring him up, and educated him as carefully as he had been her own. She intended him for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>; but he was scarcely 14 years old when he began to devote himself to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> sports, and those violent exercises which suited his great strength of body. The factions named the Guelfs and Gibelines then shared all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> between them; divided the popes and the emperors; and engaged in their different interests not only the members of the same town, but even those of the same family. Francisco, a considerable person on the side of the Gibelines, observing Castruccio's uncommon spirit and great qualities, prevailed with Antonio to let him turn soldier; on which Castruccio soon became acquainted with everything belonging to that profession, and was made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of foot by Francisco Guinigi. In his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> he gave such proofs of his courage and conduct as spread his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> all over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOMBARDY\">Lombardy</a>; and Guinigi, dying soon after, committed to him the care of his son and the management of his estate. Still distinguishing himself by his exploits, he filled his commander in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> with such jealousy and envy, that he was imprisoned by stratagem in order to be put to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. But the people of Lucca soon released him, and afterwards chose him for their sovereign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>.\u2014The Gibelines considered him as the chief of their party;\nCastruccio, party; and those who had been banished from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> fled to him for protection, and unanimously promised, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he could restore them to their estates, they would serve him so effectually that the sovereignty of their country should be his reward. Flattered by these promises, he entered into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> with the prince of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a>. He kept his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> constantly on foot, employing it as best suited his own designs. For services he had done the pope, he was made senator of Rome with more than ordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>; but while there, received news which obliged him to hasten back to Lucca. The Florentines entered into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with him, but Castruccio fought his way through them; and the supreme authority of Tuscany was ready to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> was put to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>.\n\nIn May 1328, he gained a complete victory over his enemies, who amounted to 30,000 foot and 10,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>; in which 22,000 of them were slain, with the loss of not quite 1600 of his own men; but as he was returning from the field of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, tired with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, and covered with sweat, he halted a little, in order to thank and care for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> as they passed; when, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> blowing upon him, he was immediately seized with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGUE\">ague</a>, which he at first neglected, but it carried him off in a few days, in the 44th year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>.\n\nMachiavel, who has written the life of Castruccio, says, that he was not only an extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> in his own age, but would have been so in any other.

No man was more forward to encounter dangers; no man more careful to escape them. He had an uncommon presence of mind, and often made repartees with great smartness.

Chatelet observes, that, among the more knowing of the people of Rome, the word catacomb is never applied to the subterraneous burying-places hereafter mentioned, but only to a chapel in St Sebastian, one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> national churches; where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Roman calendars say the body of St Peter was deposited, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUTATION\">confutation</a> of Tufcus and Baffus, in 258.\n\nCATACOMBS of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>; a vast assemblage of subterraneous sepulchres about Rome, chiefly at about three miles from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, in the Via Appia; supposed to be the sepulchre of the martyrs; and which are visited accordingly out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>, and relics thence taken and dispersed throughout the catholic countries, after having been first baptized by the pope under the name of some saint. These catacombs are said by many to be caves or cells wherein the primitive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> hid and assembled themselves together, and where they interred such among them as were martyred. Each catacomb is three feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and eight or ten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>; running in form of an alley or gallery, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> with others: in many places they extend within a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> of Rome. There is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> masonry or vaulting therein, but each supports itself: the two sides,\nCatacombs, which we may look on as the *parietes* or walls, were the places where the dead were deposited; which were laid lengthwise, three or four rows over one another, in the same catacomb, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the alley. They were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> cloathed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> thick tiles, and sometimes pieces of marble, cemented in a manner imitable by the moderns. Sometimes, though very rarely, the name of the deceased is found on the tile: frequently a palm is seen, painted or engraven, or the cypher Xp, which is commonly read pro Christo. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> held by many Protestant authors is, that the catacombs are heathen sepulchres, and the same with the puticuli mentioned by Feftus Pompeius; maintaining, that whereas it was the practice of the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> to burn their dead, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> was, to avoid expense, to throw the bodies of their slaves to rot in holes of the ground; and that the Roman Christians, observing at length, the great veneration paid to relics, resolved to have a stock of their own: entering therefore the catacombs, they added what cyphers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSCRIPTIONS\">inscriptions</a> they pleased; and then shut them up again, to be opened on a favourable occasion. Those in the secret, add they, dying or removing, the contrivance was forgot, till chance opened them at last. But this opinion has even less of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> than the former. Mr Monro, in the Philosophical Transactions, supposes the catacombs to have been originally the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> sepulchres of the first Romans, and dug in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of these two opinions, viz. that shades hate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>; and that they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> to hover about the places where the bodies are laid.\n\nThough the catacombs of Rome have made the greatest noise of any in the world, there are such belonging to many other cities. Those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>, according to Bishop Burnet, are much more noble and spacious than the catacombs of Rome. Catacombs have also been discovered at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a> and Catanea in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a>. The Roman catacombs take particular names from the churches in their neighbourhood, and seem to divide the circumference of the city without the walls between them, extending their galleries everywhere under, and a vast way from it; so that all the ground under Rome, and for many miles about it, some say 20, is hollow. The largest, and those commonly shown to strangers, are the catacombs of San <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEBASTIANO\">Sebastiano</a>, those of Saint Agnese, and the others in the fields a little off Saint Agnese. Women are only allowed to go into the catacombs in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCHYARD\">churchyard</a> of the Vatican on WhitSunday Monday, under pain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCOMMUNICATION\">excommunication</a>. There are men kept constantly at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> in the catacombs. As soon as the labourers discover a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> with any of the supposed marks of a saint upon it, intimation is given to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">cardinal</a> camerlingo, who immediately sends men of reputation to the place, where finding the palm, the monogram, the coloured glass, &c., the remains of the body are taken up with great respect, and translated to Rome. After the labourers have examined a gallery, they stop up the entry that leads to it; so that most of them remain thus closed up; only a few being left open to keep up the trade of showing them to strangers. This, they say, is done to prevent people from losing themselves in these subterraneous labyrinths, which indeed has often happened; but more probably to deprive the public of the means of knowing whither Catacombs, and how far the catacombs are carried.\n\nThe method of preserving the dead in catacombs seems to have been common to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the ancient nations. The catacombs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> are still extant about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> leagues from the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a>, and two miles from the city of Zaccara. They extend from thence to the pyramids of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARAOH\">Pharaoh</a>, which are about eight miles distant. They <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in a field covered with a fine running <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, of a yellowish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> is dry and hilly; the entrance of the tombs is choked up with sand; there are many open, but more that are still concealed.\n\nThe bodies found in catacombs, especially those of Egypt, are called mummies; and as their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> was formerly reckoned an efficacious medicine, they were much sought after. In this work the labourers were often obliged to clear away the sand for weeks together, without finding what they wanted. Upon coming to a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> opening of about 18 feet in depth, they descend into it by holes for the feet placed at proper intervals; and there they are sure of finding a mummy. These caves, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELLS\">wells</a> as they call them there, are hollowed out of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, which is found in all this country a few feet below the covering of sand. When one gets to the bottom of these, which are sometimes 40 feet below the surface, there are several square openings on each side into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of 10 or 15 feet wide; and these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to chambers of 15 or 20 feet square. These are all hewn out in the rock; and in each of the catacombs are to be found several of these apartments communicating with one another. They extend a great way underground, so as to be under the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMPHIS\">Memphis</a>, and in a manner to undermine its environs. In some of the chambers the walls are adorned with figures and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIEROGLYPHICS\">hieroglyphics</a>; in others the mummies are found in tombs, round the apartment, hollowed out in the rock.\n\nThe Egyptians seem to have excelled in the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMBALMING\">embalming</a> and preserving their dead bodies; as the mummies found in the Egyptian catacombs are in a better state than the bodies found either in the Italian catacombs or those of any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the world. See Embalming and Mummy.\n\nLaying up the bodies in caves, is certainly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> way of disposing of the dead; and appears to have been propagated by the Phoenicians throughout the countries to which they sent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>; the interring as we now do in the open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> or in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> was first introduced by the Christians. When an ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> died, or was killed in a foreign expedition, as his body was liable to corruption, and for that reason unfit to be transported entire, they fell on the expedient of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>, in order to bring home the ashes, to oblige the *manes* to follow; that so his country might not be destitute of the benefit of his tutelage. It was thus burning seems to have had its original; and by degrees it became common to all who could bear the expenses of it, and took place of the ancient burying; thus catacombs became diffused among the Romans, after they had borrowed the manner of burning from the Greeks, and then none but slaves were laid in the ground.

Some even prefer it to Thuanus's catalogue, as containing a greater variety of classes and books on particular subjects.\n\nThe conditions required in a catalogue are, that it indicate at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the order of the authors and of the matters, the form of the book, the number of volumes, the chronological order of the editions, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> it is written in, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the library; so as that all these circumstances may appear at once in the shortest, clearest, and easiest manner possible. In this view all the catalogues yet made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be found to be defective.\n\nAn anonymous French writer has laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of a catalogue, which shall unite all the advantages and avoid all the inconveniences of the rest.\n\nThe Jesuits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTWERP\">Antwerp</a> have given us a catalogue of the popes; which makes what they call their Propileum.","sp":266,"ep":266},{"h":"CATALOGUE OF THE STARS","t":"is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of the fixed stars, disposed in their several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTELLATIONS\">constellations</a>; with the longitudes, latitudes, &c., of each; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> according to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> ascensions, that is, the order of their passing over the meridian.\n\nThe first who undertook to reduce the fixed stars into a catalogue was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIPPARCHUS\">Hipparchus</a> Rhodius, about 120 years before Christ; in which he made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the observations of Timocharis and Arityllus for about 180 years before him. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a> retained Hipparchus's catalogue containing 1026 fixed stars; though he himself made abundance of observations, with a view to a new catalogue, A.D. 140. About the year of Christ 880, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBATEGNI\">Albategni</a>, a Syrian, brought <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the same to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. Anno 1437, Ulugh Beigh, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTHIA\">Parthia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, made a new catalogue of 1022 fixed stars, since translated out of Persian into Latin by Dr. Hyde. The third who made a catalogue from his own observations was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TYCHO_BRAHE\">Tycho Brahe</a>, who determined the places of 777 stars for the year 1600, which Kepler from other observations of Tycho afterwards increased to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of 1000 in the Rudolphine tables; adding those of Ptolemy omitted by Tycho, and of other authors; so that his catalogue amounts to above 1160. At the same time, William landgrave of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HESSE\">Hesse</a>, with his mathematicians Christopher Rothmannus and Julius Byrgius, determined the places of 400 fixed stars by his own observations, with their places rectified for the year 1593; which Havelius prefers to those of Tycho's. Ricciolus, in his Astronomia Reformata, determined the places of 101 stars for the year 1700, from his own observations; for the rest he followed Tycho's catalogue, altering it where he thought fit. Anno 1667, Dr. Halley, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of St. Helena, observed\nCatalogue observed 350 southern stars not visible in our horizon.\n\nThe same labour was repeated by F. Noel in 1710, who published a new catalogue of the same stars constructed for the year 1687.\n\nBayer, in his Uranometria, published a catalogue of 1160 stars, compiled chiefly from Ptolemy and Tycho, in which every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a> is marked with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> of the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a>; the biggest star in any constellation being denoted by the first letter, the next by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, &c., and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the number exceeds the Greek alphabet, the remaining stars are marked by letters of the Roman alphabet, which letters are preferred by Flamsteed, and by Senex on his globes. The celebrated Hevelius composed a catalogue of 1888 stars, 1553 of which were observed by himself; and their places were computed for the year 1660.\n\nThe last and greatest is the Britannic catalogue, compiled from the observations of the accurate Mr. Flamsteed; who for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of years devoted himself wholly thereto. As there was nothing wanting either in the observer or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>, we may look on this as a perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> so far as it goes. It is to be regretted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> had not passed through his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>: that now extant was published by authority, but without the author's consent: it contains 2734 stars. There was another published in 1725, pursuant to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">testament</a>; containing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less than 3000 stars, with their places rectified for the year 1689: to which is added Mr Sharp's catalogue of the southern stars not visible in our hemisphere, adapted to the year 1726.\n\nThe first catalogue, we believe, that was printed in the new or second form, according to the order of the right ascensions, is that of De la Caille, given in his Ephemerides for the ten years between 1755 and 1765, and printed in 1755. It contains the right ascensions and declinations of 307 stars, adapted to the beginning of the year 1750. In 1757 De la Caille published his Astronomiae Fundamenta, containing a catalogue of the right ascensions and declinations of 398 stars, likewise adapted to the beginning of 1750. And in 1763, the year after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, was published the Catalogus Astrale Stelliferum of the same author; containing a catalogue of the places of 1042 stars, all situated to the southward of the tropic of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPRICORN\">Capricorn</a>, and observed by him while he was at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good Hope in 1751 and 1752; their places being also adapted to the beginning of 1750. In the same year was published his Ephemerides for the ten years between 1765 and 1775; in the introduction to which are given the places of 515 zodiacal stars, all deduced from the observations of the same author; the places adapted to the beginning of the year 1765.\n\nIn the Nautical Almanac for 1773, is given a catalogue of 387 stars, in right ascension, declination, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> and latitude, derived from the observations of the late celebrated Dr Bradley, and adjusted to the beginning of the year 1760. This small catalogue, and the results of about 1200 observations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, are all that the public have yet seen of the multiplied labours of this most accurate and indefatigable observer, although he has now (1798) been dead upwards of 36 years.\n\nIn 1775 was published a thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, entitled, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">Opera</a> Medita, containing several papers of the late Tobias Mayer, and among them a catalogue of the right ascensions and declinations of 998 stars, which may be occulted by the moon and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>; the places being adapted to the beginning of the year 1756.\n\nAt the end of the first volume of \"Astronomical Observations made at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">Observatory</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a>,\" published in 1776, Dr Maskelyne, the present astronomer royal, has given a catalogue of the places of 34 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> stars, in right ascension and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> polar distance, adapted to the beginning of the year 1770.\n\nThese being the result of several years repeated observations, made with the utmost care, and the best instruments, it may be presumed are exceedingly accurate.\n\nIn 1782, M. Bode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a> published a very extensive catalogue of 1058 of the fixed stars, collected from the observations of Flamsteed, Bradley, Hevelius, Mayer, De la Caille, Messier, Monnier, D'Arquier, and other astronomers; all adapted to the beginning of the year 1780; and accompanied with a celestial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATLAS\">atlas</a> or set of maps of the constellations, engraved in a most delicate and beautiful manner.\n\nTo these may be added Dr Herschel's catalogue of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> stars, printed in the Phil. Trans. for 1782 and 1783; Messier's nebulae and clusters of stars, published in the Connaissance des Temps for 1784; and Herschel's catalogue of the same kind, given in the Phil. Trans. for 1786.\n\nIn 1789 Mr Francis Wollaston published \"A Specimen of a General Astronomical Catalogue, in Zones of North-polar Distance, and adapted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1, 1790.\" These stars are collected from all the catalogues before-mentioned, from that of Hevelius downwards. This work contains five distinct catalogues; viz.: Dr Maskelyne's new catalogue of 36 principal stars; a general catalogue of all the stars, in zones of north polar distance; an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a> to the general catalogue; a catalogue of all the stars in the order in which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> the meridian; and a catalogue of zodiacal stars, in longitude and latitude.\n\nFinally, in 1792, Dr Zach published at Gotha, Tabula Motuum Solis; to which is annexed a new catalogue of the principal fixed stars, from his own observations made in the years 1787, 1788, 1789, 1790. This catalogue contains the right ascensions and declinations of 381 principal stars, adapted to the beginning of the year 1800. Hutton's Math. Dict.\n\nBesides these two methods of forming catalogues of the stars, Dr Herschel has proposed a new one, in which the comparative brightness of the stars is accurately expressed. It is long since astronomers were first led to arrange the stars in classes of different magnitudes by their various degrees of brilliancy or lustre. Brightness and size have at all times been considered as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a> terms; so that the brightest stars have been referred to the class comprehending those of the first magnitude; and as the subsequent orders of stars have been supposed to decrease in lustre, their magnitude has been determined in the same decreasing progression: but the want of some fixed and satisfactory standard of lustre has been the source of considerable confusion and uncertainty in settling the relative magnitudes of the stars. A star marked 1. 2m. is supposed to be between the first and second magnitude; but 2. 1m. intimates, that the star is nearly of the second magnitude,\nCatalogue magnitude, and that it partakes somewhat of the lustre of the Stars, of a star of the first order. Such subdivisions may be of some use in ascertaining stars of the first, second, and third classes; but the expressions 5m, 6m, 7m, 8m, must be very vague and indefinite. Dr Herchel observes that he has found them so in fact; and he therefore considers this method of pointing out the different lustre of stars as a reference to an imaginary standard. If any dependence could be placed on this method of magnitudes, \"it would follow, that no less than 11 stars in the constellation of the Lion, namely \u03b2, \u03c3, \u03c0, \u03be, A, b, c, d, 54, 48, 72, had all undergone a change in their lustre since Flamsteed's time: For if the idea of magnitudes had been a clear one, our author, who marked \u03b2 1.2m. and \u03b3 2m. ought to be understood to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> that \u03b2 is larger than \u03b3; but we now find that actually \u03b3 is larger than \u03b2. Every one of the eleven stars (says Dr Herchel) which I have pointed out may be reduced to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>.\"\n\nThe author has pointed out the insufficiency of the insufficiency of this method, and of the uncertain conclusions that are deduced from it, in determining the comparative brightness of stars found not only in Mr Flamsteed's catalogue, but also in the catalogues of other astronomers. It is sufficiently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> that the present method of expressing the brightness of the stars is very defective. Dr Herchel therefore proposes a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a>, that is more precise and satisfactory.\n\n\"I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> each star (he says), instead of giving its magnitude, into a short series, constructed upon the order of brightness of the nearest proper stars. For instance, to express the lustre of D, I say CDE. By this short notation, instead of referring the star D to an imaginary uncertain standard, I refer it to a precise and determined existing one. C is a star that has a greater lustre than D, and E is another of less brightness than D. Both C and E are neighbouring stars, chosen in such a manner that I may see them at the same time with D, and therefore may be able to compare them properly. The lustre of C is in the same manner ascertained by BCD; that of B by ABC; and also the brightness of E by DEF; and that of F by EFG.\n\n\"That this is the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a>, as well as the most effectual way to express the brightness of a star, and by that means to detect any change that may happen in its lustre, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> appear, when we consider what is requisite to ascertain such a change. We can certainly not wish for a more decisive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, than to be assured, by actual inspection, that a certain star is now no longer more or less bright than such other stars to which it has been formerly compared; provided we are at the same time assured that those other stars remain still in their former unaltered lustre. But if the star D will no longer stand in its former order CDE, it must have undergone a change; and if that order is now to be expressed by CED, the star has lost some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of its lustre; if, on the contrary, it ought now to be denoted by DCE, its brightness must have had some addition. Then, if we should doubt the stability of C and E, we have recourse to the orders BCD and DEF, which express their lustre; or even to ABC and EFG, which continue the series both ways. Now having before us the series BCDEF, or if necessary even the more extended one ABCDEFG, it will be impossible to mistake a change of brightness in D, when every member of the series is found in its proper order except D.\"\n\nIn the author's journal or catalogue, in which the order of the lustre of the stars is fixed, each star bears its own proper name or number, e.g., \"the brightness of the star \u03b4 Leonis may be expressed by \u03b4 & Leonis, or better by 94\u201468\u201417 Leonis; these being the numbers which the three above stars bear in the British catalogue of fixed stars.\"\n\nThis method of arrangement occurred to Dr Herchel so early as the year 1782; but he was diverted from the regular pursuit of it by a variety of other astronomical engagements. After many trials, he proposed, in the Transactions of the Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> for 1796, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> which appeared to him the most eligible. It is as follows:\u2014Instead of denoting particular stars by letters, he makes use of numbers; and in his choice of the stars which are to express the lustre of any particular one, he directs his first view to perfect equality. When two stars seem to be similar both in brightness and magnitude, he puts down their numbers together, separated merely by a point, as 30.24 Leonis; but if two stars, which at first seemed alike in their lustre, appeared on a longer inspection to be different, and the preference should be always decidedly in favour of the same star, he separates these stars by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMA\">comma</a>, thus, 41.94 Leonis. This order must not be varied; nor can three such stars, as 20, 40, 39 Librae, admit of a different arrangement. If the state of the heavens should be such as to require a different order in these numbers, we may certainly infer that a change has taken place in the lustre of one or more of them. When two stars differ very little in brightness, but so that the preference of the one to the other is indisputable, the numbers that express them are separated by a short line, as\u201417\u201470 Leonis, or 68\u201417\u201470 Leonis. When two stars differ so much in brightness, that one or two other stars might be interposed between them, and still leave sufficient room for distinction, they are distinguished by a line and comma, thus,\u2014, or by two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, as 32\u201441 Leonis. A greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> than this is denoted by a broken line, thus\u2014\u201429 Bootis. On the whole, the author observes the marks and distinctions which he has adopted cannot possibly be mistaken; \"a point denoting equality of lustre; a comma indicating the least perceptible difference; a short line to mark a decided but small superiority; a line and comma, or double line, to express a considerable and striking excess of brightness; and a broken line to mark any other superiority which is to be looked upon as of no use in estimations that are intended for the purpose of directing changes.\"\n\nThe difficulties that attend this arrangement are not disguised; but the importance and utility of it more than compensate for the labour which it must necessarily require. By a method of this kind, many discoveries of changeable and periodical stars might probably have been made, which have escaped the most diligent and accurate observers. We might then, as the author suggests, be enabled to resolve a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> in which we are all immediately concerned.\n\n\"Who, for instance, would not wish to know what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of permanency we ought to ascribe to the lustre of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>? Not only the stability of our climates, but...\"\nCatalogue the very existence of the whole animal and vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> itself, is involved in the question. Where can we hope to receive information upon this subject but from astronomical observations? If it be allowed to admit the similarity of stars with our own as a point established, how necessary will it be to take notice of the fate of our neighbouring suns, in order to guess at that of our own? That star, which among the multitude we have dignified by the name of sun, to-morrow may slowly begin to undergo a gradual decay of brightness, like \u03b1 Leonis, \u03b1 Ceti, \u03b1 Draconis, \u03b1 Ursae majoris, and many other diminishing stars that will be mentioned in my catalogues. It may suddenly increase, like the wonderful star in the back of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASSIOPEIA\">Cassiopeia</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a>, and the no less remarkable one in the foot of Serpentarius; or gradually come on, like \u03b2 Geminorum, \u03b2 Ceti, \u03b3 Sagittarii, and many other increasing stars, for which I also refer to my catalogues; and, lastly, it may turn into a periodical one of 25 days <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, as Algol is one of three days, \u03b4 Cephei of five, \u03b2 Lyrae of six, \u03b1 Antiohi of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> days, and as many others as are of various periods.\n\nHaving thus explained the general principle on which this catalogue is formed, as we find it in the author's first memoir on the subject, we must refer the reader to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a>'s own account for its particular arrangement, observing only that the catalogue subjoined comprehends <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> constellations, which are arranged in alphabetical order, with the comparative brightness of the stars accurately stated. In a subsequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, published in the same volume, he has completely verified the utility of his method by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, and shown that there is no permanent change of lustre in the stars. In the notes to his first catalogue he mentioned \u03b1 Herculis as a periodical star. By a series of observations on this star, compared with \u03b1 Ophiuchi, which was most conveniently situated for his purpose, he has been able not only to confirm this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, but to ascertain its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>. His observations are arranged in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, by means of which he determines that this star had gone through four successive changes in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of 241 days; and therefore the duration of its period must be about 60 days and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>. This fact concurs with other circumstances in evincing the rotatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the stars on their axes. \"Dark spots, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> portions of the surface less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> than the rest, turned alternately in certain directions, either towards or from us, will account for the phenomena of periodical changes in the lustre of the stars, so satisfactorily, that we certainly need not look out for any other cause.\" If it be alleged that the periods in the change of lustre of some stars, such as Algol, \u03b2 Lyrae, \u03b4 Cephei, and \u03b1 Antiohi, are short, being only 3, 5, 6, and 7 days respectively; while those of \u03b1 Ceti, and of the changeable star in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HYDRA\">Hydra</a>, and that in the neck of the Swan, are long, amounting to 331, 394, and 497 days; and that we cannot ascribe phenomena so different in their duration to the same cause\u2014it may be answered to this objection, that the force of it is founded on our limited acquaintance with the state of the heavens. To the 7 stars, the periodical changes of which were before known, we may now add \u03b1 Herculis, which performs a revolution of its changes in 60 days.\n\n\"The step from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> of \u03b1 Herculis to that of \u03b1 Ceti is far less considerable than that from the period of Algol to the rotation of \u03b1 Herculis; and thus a link in the chain is now supplied, which removes the objection that arose from the vacancy.\" The rotation of the fifth satellite of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a> is proved by the change observable in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>; and \"this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of light, owing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> exposition of a more or less bright hemisphere of this periodical satellite, plainly indicates, that the similar phenomenon of a changeable star arises from the various lustre of the different parts of its surface, successively turned to us by its rotatory motion.\"\n\nBesides, we perceive a greater similarity between the sun and the stars, by means of the spots that must be admitted to exist on their surfaces, as well as on that of the sun.\n\nDr Herschel farther observes, that the stars, besides a rotatory motion on their axes, may have other movements; \"such as nutations or changes in the inclination of their axes; which, added to bodies much flattened by quick rotatory motions, or surrounded by rings like Saturn, will easily account for many new phenomena that then offer themselves to our extended views.\"","sp":266,"ep":269},{"h":"CATALONIA","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, bounded on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> by the Pyrenean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, which divide it from France; by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of Arragon and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VALENCIA\">Valencia</a> on the west; and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> on the south and east.

It was founded by the Chalcidians soon after the settlement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a>, and enjoyed great tranquillity till Hiero I. expelled the whole body of citizens; and after replenishing the town with a new stock of inhabitants, gave it the name of Aetna: immediately after his decease, it regained its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> name, and its citizens returned to their abodes. Catania fell into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, among their earliest acquisitions in Sicily, and became the residence of a praetor. To make it worthy of such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>, it was adorned with sumptuous buildings of all kinds, and every convenience was procured to supply the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> wants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. It was destroyed by Pompey's son, but restored with superior magnificence by Augustus. The reign of Decius is famous in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of this city, for the martyrdom of its patroness St Agatha. On every emergency her intercession is implored. She is piously believed to have preserved Catania from being overwhelmed by torrents of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAVA\">lava</a>, or shaken to pieces by earthquakes; yet its ancient edifices are covered by repeated streams of volcanic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>; and almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, even her own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, has been thrown to the ground. In the reign of William the Good, 20,000 Catanians, with their palaces at their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, were destroyed before the sacred veil could be properly placed to check the flames. In the last century the eruptions and earthquakes raged with redoubled violence, and Catania was twice demolished. See AETNA.\n\nThe present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of Biscari has been at infinite pains, and spent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, in working <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the ancient town, which, on account of the numerous torrents of lava that have flowed out of Mount Aetna for these last thousand years, is now to be sought for in dark caverns many feet below the present surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. Mr Swinburne informs us that he descended into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a>, sepulchres, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMPHITHEATRE\">amphitheatre</a>, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>, all very much injured by the various catastrophes that have befallen them. They were erected upon old beds of lava, and even built with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> pieces of the same substance, which in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> instance appears to have been fused by the contact of new lavas. The scoria or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> lava, have constantly proved as strong a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> against the flowing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a> of fire as any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> could have been, though some authors were of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that the hot matter would melt the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASTS\">masts</a> and incorporate with it.\n\nThis city has been frequently defended from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> streams by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> walls of its own ramparts, and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> compressed between them and the lava; as appears by the torrent having floated within a small distance of the walls, and taken another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. But when the walls were broken or low, the lava collected itself till it rose to a great height, and then poured over in a curve. A similar instance is seen at the Torre del Greco near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>, where the stream of liquid fire from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VESUVIUS\">Vesuvius</a> divided itself into two branches, and left a church untouched in the middle. There is a well at the foot of the old walls of Catania, where the lava, after running along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAPET\">parapet</a>, and then falling forwards, has produced a very complete lofty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>.\n\nThe church here is a noble fabric. It is accounted the largest in Sicily, though neither a porch nor cupola has been erected, from a doubt of the solidity of the foundations, which are no other than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of lava that ran out of Aetna in 1669, and is supposed to be full of cavities. The organ is much esteemed by connoisseurs in musical instruments.\n\nCatania, according to Mr Swinburne's account, is reviving with great splendour. \"It has already (he says) much more the features of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> residence than Palermo: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> streets are wide, straight, and well paved with lava. An obelisk of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a>, placed on the back of an antique elephant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOUCHSTONE\">touchstone</a>, stands in the centre of the great square, which is formed by the townhall, seminary, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a>. The cathedral erected by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABBOT\">abbot</a> Angerius in the year 1094, was endowed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> Roger with the territories of Catania and Aetna, for the small acknowledgement of a glass of wine and a loaf of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> offered once a-year. It has suffered so much by earthquakes, that little of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> structure remains, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> parts have hardly anything except their materials to recommend them. The other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> edifices of the city are profusely ornamented, but in a bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. The spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> seems to have seized upon the people, and the prince of Biscari's example adds fresh vigour. It were natural to suppose men would be backward in erecting new habitations, especially with any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a>, on ground so often shaken to its centre, and so often buried under the ashes of a volcano; but such is their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to their native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, and their contempt of dangers they are habituated to, that they rebuild their houses on the warm cinders of Vesuvius, the quaking plains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALABRIA\">Calabria</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> of Etna at Catania; it is however surprising to see such embellishments lavish'd in so dangerous a situation. There is a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> in the disposition of this people: they know by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> that their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> carried on a flourishing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>; and that before the fiery river filled it up, they had a spacious convenient harbour, where they now have scarce a creek for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELUCCA\">felucca</a>: they therefore wish to restore those advantages to Catania, and have often applied to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> for assistance towards forming a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOLE\">mole</a> and port, an undertaking their strength alone is unequal to; but whether the refusal originates in the deficiencies of the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a> or the jealousy of the other cities, all the projects have ended in fruitless applications. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of inhabitants dwelling in Catania amounts to 30,000; the Catanians make it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a>: A considerable portion of this number pertains to the university, the only one in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, and the nursery of all the lawyers.\"\n\nE. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">Long</a>, 15\u00b0 10' N.

In the centre of each of the beams of the bale, and near two-thirds of their length, a hole, perfectly round, and 16 inches in diameter, should be bored; these holes must be exactly opposite to each other, and should increase gradually to the inside of the beams, so that each of them, being 16 inches on the outside towards the capitals 9, should be 17\u00bd at the opening on the inside, and the edges carefully rounded off.

This piece, or nut, ought to be about two inches and one third thick at the top 18, as represented in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> at B; and rounded off and polished as much as possible, that the cords folded over it may not be hurt or cut by the roughness or edges of the iron. Its height ought to be eight inches, decreasing gradually in thickness to the bottom, where it ought to be only one inch. It must be very exactly inserted in the capitals.\n\nAfter placing the two capitals in the holes of the two beams in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> line with each other, and fixing the two cross diametrical nuts or pieces over which the cordage is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, one end of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> is reeved through a hole in one of the capitals in the base, and made fast to a nail withinside of the beam. The other side of the cord is then carried through the hole in the opposite beam and capital, and so wound over the cross pieces of iron in the centre of the two capitals, till they are full, the cordage forming a large skein. The tension or straining of the cordage ought to be exactly equal, that is, the several foldings of the cord over the capital pieces should be equally strained, and so near each other as not to leave the least space between them. As soon as the first folding or skein of cord has filled up one whole space or breadth of the capital pieces, another must be carried over it; and so on, always equally straining the end till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through the capitals, and the skein of cordage entirely fills them, observing to rub it from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to time with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>.\n\nAt three or four inches behind the cordage, thus wound over the capital pieces, two very strong upright beams 21 are raised: these are posts of oak 14 inches thick, crossed over at top by another of the same solidity. The height of the upright beams is 7\u00bd diameters; each supported behind with very strong props 25, fixed at bottom in the extremities of the base 2, 3. The cross beam 24 is supported in the same manner by a prop in the centre.\n\nThe tree, arm, or stylus 22, should be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> ash. Its length is from 15 to 16 diameters of the bore of the capitals. The end at the bottom, or that fixed in the middle of the skein, is 10 inches thick, and 14 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>. To strengthen the arm or tree, it should be wrapped round with a cloth dipped in strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLUE\">glue</a> like the tree of a saddle, and bound very hard with waxed thread of the sixth of an inch in diameter, from the large end at bottom, almost to the top, as represented in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>.\n\nAt the top of the arm, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> under the iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> or receiver 27, a strong cord is fastened, with two loops twisted one within another, for the greater strength. Into these two loops the hook of a brass pulley 28 is put. The cord 29 is then reeved through the pulley, Catapulta and fastened to the roll 30. The cock or trigger 31, which serves as a stay, is then brought to it, and made fast by its hook to the extremity of the hand 27, in which the body to be discharged is placed. The pulley at the neck of the arm is then unhooked; and when the trigger is to let it off, a stroke must be given upon it with an iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> or crow of about an inch in diameter; on which the arm flies up with a force almost equal to that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a>. The cushion or stomacher 23, placed exactly in the middle of the cross beam 24, should be covered with tanned ox hide, and stuffed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, the arm striking against it with inconceivable force. It is to be observed, that the tree or arm 22 describes an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of 90 degrees, beginning at the cock, and ending at the stomacher or cushion.\n\nCATAPULTA for Arrows, Spears, or Darts. Some of the spears, &c., thrown by these engines, are said to have been 18 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, and to have been thrown with such velocity as to take fire in their course.\n\nABCD is the frame that holds the darts or arrows, which may be of different numbers, and placed in different directions. EF is a large and strong iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, which is bent by a rope that goes over three pulleys, I, K, L; and is drawn by one or several men; this rope may be fastened to a pin at M. The rope, therefore, being set at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, the spring must strike the darts with great violence, and send them with surprising velocity, to a great distance. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> differs in some particulars from the description we have of that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>; principally in the throwing of several darts at the same time, one only being thrown by theirs.","sp":271,"ep":272},{"h":"CATARACT","t":"in Medicine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURGERY\">Surgery</a>, a disorder of the humours of the eye, by which the pupilla, that ought to appear transparent and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, looks opaque, blue, gray, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>, &c., by which vision is variously impeded, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> totally destroyed.

Every one of them, he observes, spins itself a very beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of a cylindric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, made of a very strong sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>; these are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> in which this animal spends its state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRYSALIS\">chrysalis</a>; and they have a mark by which they may be known from all other animal productions of this kind, which is, that they have always a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> stripe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> band surrounding their middle, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> when the rest of the case is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, and white when that is black. M. Reaumur has had the pains and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> to find out the reason of this singularity, which is this: the whole shell is spun of a silk produced out of the creature's body; this at first runs all white, and towards the end of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINNING\">spinning</a> turns black. The outside of the case must necessarily be formed first, as the creature works from within: consequently this is truly white all over, but it is transparent, and shows the last spun or black silk through it. It might be supposed that the whole inside of the shell should be black; but this is not the case: the whole is fashioned before this black silk comes; and this is employed by the creature, not to line the whole, but to fortify certain parts only; and therefore is all applied either to the middle, or to the two ends omitting the middle; and so gives either a black band in the middle, or a blackness at both ends, leaving the white in the middle to appear. It is not unfrequent\nCATHERINE. I. Empress of Russia, a most extraordinary personage, whose history deserves to be given in detail. She was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> girl; and was born at Ringen, a small village upon the lake Virtscheve, near Dorpt, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVONIA\">Livonia</a>. The year of her birth is uncertain; but, according to her own account, she came into the world on the 5th of April 1687. Her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> name was Martha, which she changed for Catherine when she embraced the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Rosen, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLONEL\">colonel</a> in the Swedish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, who owned the village of Ringen, supported, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of the country, both the mother and the child; and was, for that reason, supposed by many persons to have been her father. She lost her mother when she was but three years old; and, as Count Rosen died about the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, she was left in so deplorable a situation, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> clerk of the village received her into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>. Soon afterwards Gluck, Lutheran minister of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARIENBURG\">Marienburg</a>, happening, in a journey through those parts, to see the foundling, took her under his protection, brought her up in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and employed her in attending his children. In 1701, and about the 14th year of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, she espoused a dragoon of the Swedish garrison of Marienburg. Many different accounts are given of this transaction: one author of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> affirms that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDE\">bride</a> and bridegroom remained together eight days after their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>; another, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less authority, affirms, on the contrary, that on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of the nuptials her husband being sent with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGA\">Riga</a>, the marriage was never consummated. Thus much is certain, that the dragoon was absent when Marienburg surrendered to the Russians; and Catherine, who was reserved for a higher fortune, never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> him more.\n\nGeneral Bauer, upon the taking of Marienburg, saw Catherine among the prisoners; and, being smitten with her youth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, took her to his house, where she superintended his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> affairs, and was supposed to be his mistress. Soon afterwards she was removed into the family of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> Mensikof, who was no less struck with the attractions of the fair captive. With him she lived until 1704; when, in the 17th year of her age, she became the mistress of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> the Great, and won so much upon his affections, that he espoused her on the 29th of May 1711. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> was secretly performed at Jawetow in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a>, in the presence of General Bruce; and on the 29th of February 1712, it was publicly solemnized with great pomp at Petersburgh.\n\nCatherine, by the most unrestrained affluence and unremitting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, by the softness and complacency of her disposition, but above all by an extraordinary liveliness,\nCatherine's liveliness and gaiety of temper, acquired a wonderful ascendancy over the mind of Peter. The latter was subject to occasional horrors, which at times rendered him gloomy and suspicious, and raised his passions to such a height as to produce a temporary madness. In these dreadful moments Catherine was the only person who durst venture to approach him; and such was the kind of fascination she had acquired over his senses, that her presence had an instantaneous effect, and the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> composed his mind and calmed his agonies. From these circumstances she seemed necessary not only to his comfort, but even to his very existence; she became his inseparable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> on his journeys to foreign countries, and even in all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> expeditions.\n\nThe peace of Pruth, by which the Russian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> was rescued from certain destruction, has been wholly attributed to Catherine, though she was little more than an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> in procuring the consent of Peter. The latter, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> of 1711 against the Turks, having imprudently led his troops into a disadvantageous situation, took the desperate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> his way through the Turkish army in the night. With this resolution he retired to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENT\">tent</a> in an agony of despair, and gave positive orders that no one should be admitted under pain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. In this important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> officers and the vice <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> Shafirov assembled in the presence of Catherine, and drew up certain preliminaries in order to obtain a truce from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> vizier. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this determination, plenipotentiaries were immediately despatched, without the knowledge of Peter, to the grand vizier, and a peace obtained upon more reasonable conditions than could have been expected. With these conditions Catherine, notwithstanding the orders issued by Peter, entered his tent, and prevailed upon him to sign them. Catherine, by her conduct on this occasion, acquired great popularity; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> particularly specifies her behaviour at Pruth as one of the reasons which induced him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> her publicly at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSCOW\">Moscow</a> with his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. This ceremony was performed in 1724; and although designed by Peter only as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of his affection, was the principal cause of her subsequent elevation.\n\nHer influence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> undiminished until a short time before the death of the emperor, when some circumstances happened which occasioned such a coolness between them as would probably have ended in a total rupture, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> his death had not fortunately intervened. The original cause of this misunderstanding arose from the following discovery of a secret connexion between Catherine and her first chamberlain, whose name was Mons. The emperor, who was culpable of this connexion, quitted Petersburgh under pretence of removing to a villa for a few days, but privately returned to his winter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>. From thence he occasionally sent one of his confidential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a> with a complimentary message to the empress, as if he had been in the country, and with secret orders to observe her motions. From the page's information the emperor, on the third night, surprized Catherine in an arbour of the garden with her favourite Mons; while his sister, Madame Balke, who was first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> of the bedchamber to the empress, was, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with a page, upon the watch without the arbour.\n\nPeter, whose violent temper was inflamed by this discovery, struck Catherine with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANE\">cane</a>, as well as the page, who endeavoured to prevent him from entering the arbour, and then retired without uttering a single word either to Mons or his sister. A few days after this transaction these persons were taken into custody, and Mons was carried to the winter palace, where no one had admission to him but Peter, who himself brought him his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>. A report was at the same time circulated, that they were imprisoned for having received bribes, and making their influence over the empress subservient to their own mercenary views. Mons being examined by Peter, in the presence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a>-general Ushakov, and threatened with the torture, confessed the corruption which was laid to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>. He was beheaded; his sister received five strokes of the knout, and was banished into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>; two of her sons, who were chamberlains, were also degraded, and sent as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> among the Russian troops in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> subsequent to the execution of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>, Peter conveyed Catherine in an open carriage under the gallows, to which was nailed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of Mons. The empress, without changing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> at this dreadful sight, exclaimed, \"What a pity it is that there is so much corruption among courtiers!\"\n\nThis event happened in the latter end of the year 1724; and as it was soon followed by Peter's death, and Catherine upon her accession recalled Madame Balke, it has been suspected that the shortened the days of her husband by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a>. But notwithstanding the critical situation for Catherine in which he died, and her subsequent elevation, this charge is totally destitute of the least shadow of proof; for the circumstances of Peter's disorder were too well known, and the peculiar symptoms of his last illness sufficiently account for his death, without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of recurring to poison.\n\nWhile Peter was yet lying in the agonies of death, several opposite parties were caballing to dispose of the crown. At a considerable meeting of many among the principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, it was secretly determined, on the moment of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a>, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARREST\">arrest</a> Catherine, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> Peter Alexievitch upon the throne. Baffevitz, apprised of this resolution, repaired in person to the empress, although it was already night. \"My grief and consternation,\" replied Catherine, \"render me incapable of acting myself: do you and Prince Mensikof consult together, and I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> embrace the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> which you shall approve in my name.\" Baffevitz, finding Mensikof asleep, awakened and informed him of the pressing danger which threatened the empress and her party. As no time remained for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> deliberation, the prince instantly seized the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a>, secured the fortresses, gained the officers of the guards by bribes and promises, also a few of the nobility, and the principal clergy. These partizans being convened in the palace, Catherine made her appearance; she claimed the throne in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of her coronation at Moscow; she expounded the ill effects of a minority; and promised, that, \"so far from depriving the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of the crown, she would receive it only as a sacred deposit, to be restored to him when she should be united, in another world, to an adored husband, whom she was now upon the point of losing.\"\nThe pathetic manner with which she uttered this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, and the tears which accompanied it, added to the previous distribution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> sums of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> and jewels, produced the desired effect: at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of this meeting the remainder of the night was employed in making the necessary preparations to ensure her accession in case of the emperor's death.\n\nPeter at length expired on the morning of the 28th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1725. This event being made known, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>, the generals, the principal nobility and clergy, hastened to the palace to proclaim the new sovereign. The adherents of the great duke seemed secure of success, and the friends of Catherine were avoided as persons doomed to destruction. At this juncture Baflevitz whispered one of the opposite party, \"The empress is mistress of the treasure and the fortresses; she has gained over the guards and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNOD\">synod</a>, and many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> nobility; even here she has more followers than you imagine; advise therefore your friends to make no opposition as they value their heads.\" This information being rapidly circulated, Baflevitz gave the appointed signal, and the two regiments of guards, who had been gained by a largess to declare for Catherine, and had already surrounded the palace, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> to arms. \"Who has dared (exclaimed Prince Repnin, the commander in chief), to order out the troops without my knowledge?\" \"I, (returned General Butterlin), without pretending to dispute your authority, in obedience to the commands of my most gracious mistress.\" This short reply was followed by a dead silence. In this moment of suspense and anxiety Menzikof entered, preceding Catherine, supported by the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLSTEIN\">Holstein</a>. She attempted to speak, but was prevented by sobs and tears from giving utterance to her words: at length, recovering herself, \"I come (she said), notwithstanding the grief which now overwhelms me, to assure you, that, submissive to the will of my departed husband, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> will be ever dear to me, I am ready to devote my days to the painful occupations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> until <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a> shall summon me to follow him.\" Then, after a short pause, she artfully added, \"If the great duke will profit by my instructions, perhaps I shall have the consolation, during my wretched widowhood, of forming for you an emperor worthy of the blood and the name of him whom you have now irretrievably lost.\" \"As this crisis (replied Menzikof) is a moment of such importance to the good of the empire, and requires the most mature deliberation, your majesty will permit us to confer, without restraint, that this whole affair may be transacted without reproach, as well in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of the present age as in that of posterity.\" \"Acting as I do (answered Catharine), more for the public good than for my own advantage, I am not afraid to submit all my concerns to the judgment of such an enlightened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>: you have not only my permission to confer with freedom; but I lay my commands upon you all to deliberate maturely on this important subject, and I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> to adopt whatever may be the result of your decisions.\" At the conclusion of these words the assembly retired into another apartment, and the doors were locked.\n\nIt was previously settled by Menzikof and his party that Catherine should be empress; and the guards, who surrounded the palace with drums <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> and colours <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a>, effectually vanquished all opposition. The only circumstance, therefore, which remained, was to give a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> colour to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>, by persuading the assembly that Peter intended to have named her his successor. For this purpose Menzikof demanded of that emperor's secretary, whether his late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> had left any written <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> of his intentions? The secretary replied, \"That a little before his last journey to Moscow he had destroyed a will; and that he had frequently expressed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of making another, but had always been prevented by the reflection, that if he thought his people whom he had raised from a state of barbarism to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of power and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, could be ungrateful, he would not expose his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> inclinations to the insult of a refusal; and that if they recollected what they owed to his labours, they would regulate their conduct by his intentions, which he had disclosed with more solemnity than could be manifested by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERCATION\">altercation</a> now began in the assembly; and some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a> having the courage to oppose the accession of Catharine, Theophanes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of Plecoff called to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a> the oath which they had all taken in 1722 to acknowledge the successor appointed by Peter; and added, that the sentiments of that emperor delivered by the secretary were in effect an appointment of Catherine. The opposite party, however, denied these sentiments to be so clear as the secretary chose to intimate; and insisted, that as their late monarch had failed to nominate his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of the new sovereign should revert to the estate. Upon this the archbishop farther testified, that the evening before the coronation of the empress at Moscow, Peter had declared, in the house of an English merchant, that he should place the crown upon her head with no other view than to leave her mistress of the empire after his decease. This attestation being confirmed by many persons present, Menzikof cried out, \"What need have we of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">testament</a>? A refusal to conform to the inclination of our great sovereign, thus authenticated, would be both unjust and criminal. Long live the empress Catherine!\" These words being instantaneously repeated by the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of those who were present, Menzikof, saluting Catherine by the title of empress, paid his first obeisance by kissing her hand; and his example was followed by the whole assembly. She next presented herself at the window to the guards, and to the people, who shouted acclamations of \"Long live Catherine!\" while Menzikof flattered among them handfuls of money. Thus (says a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a>) the empress was raised to the throne by the guards, in the same manner as the Roman emperors by the praetorian cohorts, without either the appointment of the people or of the legions.\n\nThe reign of Catharine may be considered as the reign of Menzikof, that empress having neither inclination or abilities to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the helm of government; and she placed the most implicit confidence in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> who had been the original author of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a>, and the sole instrument of her elevation to the throne.\n\nDuring her short reign her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> was very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>; she was extremely averse to business; would frequently, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> was fine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> whole nights in the open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; and was particularly intemperate in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of\nCatherine, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TOKAY\">tokay</a> wine. These irregularities, joined to a cancer and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DROPSY\">dropsy</a>, hastened her end; and she expired on the 17th of May 1727, a little more than two years after her accession to the throne, and in about the 40th year of her age.\n\nAs the deaths of sovereigns in despotic countries are seldom imputed to natural causes, that of Catherine has also been attributed to poison; as if the disorders which preyed upon her frame were not sufficient to bring her to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>. Some assert that she was poisoned in a glass of spirituous liquor; others by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEAR\">pear</a> given her by General Diever. Suspicious also fell upon Prince Menzikof, who, a short time before her decease, had a trifling misunderstanding with her, and who was accused of hastening her death, that he might reign with still more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> power during the minority of Peter II. But these reports deserve not the least credit, and were merely dictated by the spirit of party, or by popular rumour.\n\nCatherine was in her person under the middle size, and in her youth delicate and well formed, but inclined to corpulency as she advanced in years. She had a fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>, dark eyes, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, which she was always accustomed to dye with a black colour. She could neither read nor write: her daughter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> usually signed her name for her, and particularly to her last will and testament; and Count Otterman generally put her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIGNATURE\">signature</a> to the public decrees and despatches. Her abilities have been greatly exaggerated by her panegyrists. Gordon, who had frequently seen her, seems, of all writers to have represented her character with the greatest justness, when he says, \"She was a very pretty well-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> woman, of good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, but not of that sublimity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>, or rather that quickness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, which some people have believed. The great reason why the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CZAR\">czar</a> was so fond of her, was her exceeding good temper; she never was seen peevish or out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>; obliging and civil to all, and never forgetful of her former condition: withal, mighty grateful.\" Catherine maintained the pomp of majesty with an air of ease and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> united; and Peter used frequently to express his admiration at the propriety with which she supported her high station, without forgetting that she was not born to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>.\n\nThe following anecdotes will prove that she bore her elevation meekly; and, as Gordon affirms, was never forgetful of her former condition. When Wurm, who had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> to Gluck's children at the time that Catherine was a domestic in that clergyman's family, presented himself before her after her marriage with Peter had been publicly solemnized, she recollected and addressed him with great complacency, \"What, thou good man, art thou still alive! I will provide for thee.\" And she accordingly settled upon him a pension. She was no less attentive to the family of her benefactor Gluck, who died a prisoner at Moscow: she pensioned his widow; made his son a page; portioned the two eldest daughters; and advanced the youngest to be one of her maids of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>. If we may believe Weber, she frequently inquired after her first husband; and, when she lived with Prince Menzikof, used secretly to send him small sums of money, until, in 1705, he was killed in a skirmish with the enemy.\n\nBut the most noble part of her character was her Catherine, peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> and compassion for the unfortunate. Motraye has paid a handsome tribute to this excellence. \"She had, in some sort, the government of all his (Peter's) passions; and even saved the lives of a great many more persons than Le Fort was able to do: she inspired him with that humanity which, in the opinion of his subjects, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> seemed to have denied him. A word from her mouth in favour of a wretch, just going to be sacrificed to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>, would disarm him; but if he was fully resolved to satisfy that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, he would give orders for the execution when he was absent, for fear she should plead for the victim.\" In a word, to use the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of the celebrated Munich, \"Elle estoit proprement la mediatrice entre le monarque et ses sujets.\"\n\nCatherine II., empress of Russia, whose original name was Sophia Augusta Frederica, was the daughter of Christian Augustus of Anhalt Zerbitz, a small district in Upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a>, and was born in the castle of Zerbitz, on the 23rd of May 1729. She was educated under the eye of her parents, along with her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Prince Frederic Augustus, and at an early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> displayed a masculine spirit. Elegant, majestic, and handsome, in her person, her complexion exhibited the union of the lily and the rose, while a native dignity was tempered by a smile of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>. But it was early observed, that she concealed under this a certain austerity of disposition, and an ambition, which was even then considered as excessive, and proved afterwards to be infatiable.\n\nShe soon learned all the fashionable accomplishments of that day. In addition to her native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, she wrote and conversed in French; of music she acquired a competent knowledge, and excelled particularly in needlework, which she did not disdain to practice after her elevation to the throne.\n\nThe empress Elizabeth, who had pitched upon her nephew the duke of Holstein Gottorp Oldenbourg for her successor, was also desirous to choose a consort for him, and the princess of Anhalt Zerbitz was selected upon this occasion, when only fourteen years of age. She was chiefly indebted for so unexpected an honour to the tender regard which her imperial majesty always entertained for the memory of her uncle, who had been her lover; and in an evil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> she united the fate of the prince, better known afterwards by the name of Peter III., to that of the princess of Anhalt Zerbitz. In consequence of a special invitation, the future empress repaired to St Petersburg, accompanied by her mother, and being admitted into the bosom of the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONIAL\">ceremonial</a> of marriage, after some delay, took place; on which these august personages were formally acknowledged, by her imperial majesty and the senate, as grand duke and duchess of Russia. Elizabeth, at the same time, presented them with the palace of Oranienbaum, delightfully situated on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRONSTADT\">Cronstadt</a>, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> residence; this had formerly belonged to Menzikof, the favourite of Peter the Great, who, in this capricious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, had been by turns a pie-boy, a prince, and an exile.\n\nThe grand duke was far from being handsome; on the contrary, his person was disagreeable, and almost disgusting. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> had been greatly neglected, and he was passionately fond of military parade. Fre-\nCatherine derick of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a> was at once his friend and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a>; he kept up a secret correspondence with that monarch, at the time when Russia was at open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with him; he was accustomed in his cups to kneel before a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a>; and, after quaffing a bumper, he would exclaim, \"My brother! we shall conquer the world together.\"\n\nThe first moments of this union seemed to be peculiarly auspicious. The illustrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> were accustomed to withdraw themselves daily, as if desirous to enjoy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of each other's company, in preference to the giddy dissipation of a court. It was perceived at last, that grandeur was not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>, and that nuptial felicity was not confined to plebeian life.\n\nThe empress hoped that the name and pretensions of Prince Ivan would be obliterated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> of the grand duke, and the whole empire impatiently wished for and now expected an heir to the throne of Peter the Great. It has since been discovered, that this young couple occupied their time in a far different manner than was then suspected! His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIGHNESS\">highness</a>, it seems, retired from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> on purpose to perfect himself in the Prussian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, and his comfort on these occasions participated in his diversions, for he was accustomed to make her stand for hours together, as a centinel, with a musket at her shoulder. This species of entertainment did not altogether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> the disposition of a young princess of an ardent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">temperament</a>, and her highness accordingly began, in her own language, to think \"that she was made for something else.\" Although she did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>, she at this period governed her husband, and even concealed his foibes; imagining at first that she could not reign but by means of him, she wisely determined to make him appear worthy of a throne.\n\nA marriage of eight years was not productive of any issue, and strange suspicions began to be entertained. This alarmed the court, for a formidable rival, who possessed a superior claim to the throne, still existed; it is true he was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONDAGE\">bondage</a>, but in a country like Russia, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> might not be long between a dungeon and a throne. The birth of a son and daughter, soon after this, put an end to all apprehensions of this kind, and tended not a little to give stability to the empire.\n\nThe grand duke, who at times discovered noble, and even magnanimous sentiments, had about this period formed a most unfortunate connexion with Elizabeth Voronoff, a lady of high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, but neither celebrated for her beauty nor her talents. He seldom saw his comfort in private, and all the hours that were not occupied either by military exhibitions, or the pleasures of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, were entirely devoted to his mistress.\n\nThe grand duchess, on the other hand, is said to have spent much of her time in company with a young Pole, whose history, like that of Catherine's, has since been interwoven with the annals of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. This was Count Poniatowski, afterwards known as Stanislaus Augustus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Poland. He was the third son of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEE\">grandee</a> of the same name, the favourite of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> XII. of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>, by the princess Ezatoryka, who boasted the possession of the noblest blood in Poland, as she traced her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> from the Jagellon, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> sovereigns of Lithuania. His person was of exquisite symmetry, his air noble, his manners agreeable; in short, he possessed a charming exterior, and his mind, a Catherine, circumstance extremely rare, was no less graceful than his person. At this period he was in no higher station, than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> in the suite of the minister <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLENIPOTENTIARY\">plenipotentiary</a> from England, who had formed an intimacy with his family during a former mission at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARSAW\">Warsaw</a>. Being now taught to look higher, he returned to his native country, and appeared soon after at Petersburg, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> from the king of Poland. In this new capacity he did not forget to pay his respects at the little court of Oranienbaum, and the young plenipotentiary, with a view of ingratiating himself with the grand duke, smoked, drank, and praised the king of Prussia. At length Paul Petrovitch received the Polish minister with coolness, and he was actually forbidden to visit at the palace. This, however, it is said, did not deter him from concealing the order of the white eagle, and disguising himself as a mechanic, under which assumed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> he repaired one summer's evening to the gardens, in the neighbourhood of the gulf of Cronstadt; but he was discovered by his highness, who ordered him to be brought before him, and, after affecting to reprimand the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> for his disrespect to the representative of a crowned head, told him he was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to depart.\n\nFrom this moment the grand duchess is said to have changed both her system and her conduct. She had formerly aspired only to direct the counsels of the future emperor; she now resolved, if possible, to obtain the crown for her son, and the regency for herself. Such a task would have discouraged a common mind, for it was impossible to achieve this without prevailing on the empress to consent to dethrone her own nephew, Befluchef, the grand chancellor, who hated the heir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>, joined cordially in this scheme; and Elizabeth, who herself had obtained the crown by means of a revolution, was taught to tremble for her life, in consequence of the designs of her successor, who was represented as having resolved to shorten her days by poison. But a sudden and unexpected revolution in the ministry put an end to these intrigues; for Befluchef was driven into exile, and Poniatowski recalled.\n\nA long and melancholy interval now ensued, during which the ambition of the grand duchess was rather suspended than annihilated. She, however, had recourse to, and soothed her anguish by means of books; it was in her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> that she laid the foundation of her future greatness, and rendered herself in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> deserving of a throne. During her leisure moments she found means to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> partisans, and she acquired the favour of the soldiery, who did duty around her person, by means of her liberality and condescension. Peter, on the other hand, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> exertions of a common soldier, added the orgies of a debauchee. Surrounded by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> favourites, he consumed whole days and nights in intoxication, and forgot that he was a prince. There were some few moments, however, when he appeared great, and even magnanimous, but unfortunately they were of short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>; and it was his misfortune to have a weak woman for his mistress, and an able and ambitious one for his wife.\n\nSuch was the situation of the court, when Elizabeth died, on the 5th of January 1762. This event, so productive of interesting effects, had been long foreseen\nCatherine, by Catherine, who now began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> a more conspicuous part on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a> of public affairs. Her sorrow, which appeared unbounded, was only equalled by her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>. She was constantly employed either at her prayers in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a>, or occupied in public processions, during which she scrupulously adhered to all the ceremonious practices of the Greek church. The courtiers were astonished at the sudden change, and affected to survey it with contempt; but it imposed on the populace, and the priests were highly gratified with the zeal of the empress, more especially as her consort had always treated their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> with indignity.\n\nAnother design, meditated with no less art, proved unsuccessful. She is said to have made use of all her eloquence to persuade Peter, that he ought to leave off the barbarous custom of being proclaimed emperor by the army, in the same manner as his predecessors: instead of this, the proposal that his title should be recognized by the senate alone, and produced a speech which she herself had composed for the occasion; but Godowitz, one of the favourites, and the only friend of the new sovereign, perceived the snare, and partly owing to his entreaties, and partly from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to every thing military, the soldiery were as usual gratified with the ceremony of saluting the czar.\n\nThe grand duke now ascended the throne, by the name of Peter III., and the commencement of the new reign appeared to be peculiarly auspicious. The catastrophe, which terminated a short reign of six months, may be attributed to three apparently trifling, but, in reality, irretrievable errors; for it is allowed on all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, that if they did not constitute the original cause, they at least afforded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> for his dethronement and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a>. The first of these was, the sudden peace with, and marked predilection for, the king of Prussia, certainly the greatest monarch of his age; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, an attempt to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> a barbarous and fanatical clergy, whose power Peter I. had curbed, but whose persons he still affected to consider as sacred; the third was, the war against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>.\n\nLet it be recollected, however, in honour to his memory, that the young monarch, immediately after his elevation, threw open the state <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRISONS\">prisons</a>, recalled Munich, Biron, Leibnitz, and several others, who had offended him during the late reign, from Siberia; that he limited the despotism of his officers, abridged his own power, by abolishing a state <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INQUISITION\">inquisition</a>, exercised under the name of the Secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">Council</a> of Chancellors; and that he framed the memorable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> which enfranchised the nobles from compulsory service in the army, and permitted them to travel without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> permission.\n\nThe following answer to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> from the king of Prussia, who had requested him to be on his guard against the plot then meditating, conveys no unfavourable opinion of his heart.\n\n\"Touching the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> you express for my safety, I request you will rest contented. I am called the father of my soldiers\u2014they prefer a male to a female government. I walk alone constantly in St Petersburg\u2014if any mischief is meditated, it would have been effected long since; but I am a general benefactor. I repose myself on the protection of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>; trusting to that, I have nothing to fear.\"\n\nThis false security proved his ruin. While his mind was occupied with plans of reform, and he aspired to Catherine-rival, and even to excel, his illustrious predecessor, whose name he had assumed, a person who had sworn fidelity to him at the altar, and who owed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> ties of a wife and a subject, was actually employed in planning a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a>, and organizing a revolt, against him. It has been said that he intended to have shut up his consort and son in a convent. But did a meditated imprisonment justify treachery, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a>, and murder? On the other hand, it is known that, so far from this being the intention of Peter, he was preparing for a journey to Holstein, and had actually empowered his consort to act as regent during his absence.\n\nThe intrigues of the emperor did not escape the eagle eyes of his enemies. He purposed to carry his guards into Holstein, with a view to recover the possessions wrested from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>. The regiments that had hitherto done duty at the palace, and were inured to the indulgences of the capital, revolted at the idea of a foreign war: they had been accustomed to be governed by women, and they were taught to fix their eyes on the comfort of the czar.\n\nIt is not the least wonderful part of her conduct, that, previously to the great catastrophe now meditating, Catherine contrived to appear abandoned by all the world. She knew how interesting a female, and more especially an empress, appeared while in distress; and she took care to heighten the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> of the public, by bursting at times into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a> of tears. This artful woman had found means to attach many persons to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTINY\">destiny</a>: it must be owned, however, that her adherents were neither so powerful, nor so numerous, as to afford her any well-founded hopes of success. She had gained several favourites, and some privates, of the guards: but her principal partisans consisted of the princesses d'Archevoff, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIECE\">niece</a> to the new chancellor; Prince Rozamouffski, who had risen from obscurity, having been originally a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a>; Odart, an intriguing Italian; and Panin, governor to the grand duke. The arrest of Pasliek, one of the conspirators, seemed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to a discovery, which would have proved fatal to the malcontents; but this very circumstance induced them to declare instantly, and in the end crowned an apparently rash attempt with success.\n\nThe empress, who was asleep at the castle of Petershaff, received intimation of their design by a common soldier, who soon after returned with a carriage and eight horses. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> of this man, and accompanied only by a few peasants, a German female domestic, and a French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VALET\">valet</a> de chambre, she arrived at eight o'clock in the morning in the capital, and stopped opposite the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRACKS\">barracks</a> of the regiment of Linaloff. There she addressed the soldiers in an eloquent speech, intermingled with sighs and tears, and actually found means to persuade them that she and her son had but that moment escaped from the hands of assassins, sent by the emperor to murder them. This story, by agitating the passions of the troops, had a wonderful effect on them, and they all swore, with the exception of only one regiment, to die in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of her and the young archduke. On this the empress ordered a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRUCIFIX\">crucifix</a> to be brought, and commanded the priests to administer a new oath of allegiance. She afterwards repaired to one of the principal churches, where she was met\nCatherine met by the bishop of Novgorod and the clergy, and having returned thanks to Almighty God, ascended a balcony, and presented her son to the people. In a few hours she was again seen, dressed in the uniform of the guards, riding at the head of a numerous and well-appointed army against her husband.\n\nThat unfortunate prince first made a show of resistance, and manned his Lilliputian batteries, at Oranienbaum, with his Holstein guards, in order to oppose what appeared to him to be a contemptible sedition. When it was too late, he attempted to get possession of Cronstadt. He might still have escaped to Revel, but the women in his galley were apprehensive of danger, and the courtiers thuddered at the proposition of old Munich, who wished them to assist the sailors in rowing.\n\nOn the first intelligence of the plot this intrepid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a> had repaired to his benefactor, and advised him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> directly to the capital, at the head of his German troops. \"I shall precede you (said the generous veteran), and my dead body shall be a rampart to your sacred person.\" But, on the other hand, the emissaries of the empress, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a> their hands in their crocodile tears, deprecated resistance, magnified the danger, and invited him to repose in the inviolable fidelity of his consort. In short, on the 14th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>, 1762, he was taken prisoner by the orders of his own wife, to whom he had been married 14 years, prevailed on by the threats and entreaties of Count Panin to renounce his crown, conveyed to the castle of Robetcha, and three days afterwards put to death. Of the titled minions, who perpetrated this daring murder, one carried the guilty marks of the czar's scymitar on his forehead to the grave, and another, tortured for years by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> of the last bloody <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> in the tragedy of his expiring sovereign, exhibited a shocking spectacle of insanity and remorse.\n\nThe empress, on her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> of the new vacant crown, notified the event to all the courts of Europe, under her new name of Catherine Alexeiwna II. But there was still a competitor for the empire, and suspicion never flutters near a throne. This was Prince Ivan, son to the princes of Mecklenburg, and grand nephew to Peter the Great and the empress <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNA\">Anna</a> Ivanowna, who had destined him for her successor; but, in consequence of a former revolution, he was fettered while yet an infant, and doomed to lead a life of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a>. During 18 years of precarious existence, he had been shut up in the castle of Schlusfeldbourg, and never in all that time did he breathe the open air, or behold the sky, but once. This prince was visited by Peter III. who finding him in an arched room, 20 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, determined to set him at liberty; but alas! the youth, in consequence of his long and solitary confinement, had been deprived of his senses. In this situation, the emperor determined to build a house for him, with a convenient terrace, where he might take the air daily within the fortress. Such, however, are the changes of fortune, that, in three weeks, he himself was also precipitated from a throne, and exposed to a violent death. This event was but the prelude to that of Ivan; for, as orders had been given, in case of an attempt to rescue him, that an end should be put to his life, and a real or pretended plot having been hatched for this purpose, the motives and details of which have hitherto been involved in the most profound obscurity, the unhappy prince experienced the same fate as his generous protector.\n\nCatherine being now firmly seated on the throne, wisely determined to divert the thoughts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> from the late horrid scenes, and fix them on more agreeable objects. Having foothold Prussia, acquired a preponderance in the cabinet of Denmark, long become an absolute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>, and entered into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> with the popular party in Sweden, not yet bereft of its liberties, she <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> her eyes on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURLAND\">Courland</a>, then governed by Prince Charles of Saxony, the second son of Augustus III., king of Poland; and, finding that country admirably situated for the increase of her present, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of her future power, she, in 1762, expelled the lawful sovereign, and invested Biron, a creature of her own, with the ducal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. Not content with this, the new duke, soon reduced to the most abject dependence, was prevented from resigning his precarious power, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> assembled at Mitau were actually interdicted from nominating a successor. This, however, was only a prelude to far greater scenes, for she had hardly dethroned one sovereign before she undertook to create another. Augustus II., or as he is called by some, Augustus III., of Poland, having died at Dresden, in 1763, her imperial majesty did not let slip so fair an opportunity for interfering in the appointment to the vacant throne, and even placing one of her dependents on it. Count Poniatowski, on the elevation of Catherine, had sent a friend to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETERBURGH\">Peterburgh</a>, to sound the disposition of the empress about his return to that capital, where he naturally hoped to participate in her power, and bask in the sunshine of the royal smiles. But the more prudent German, who was at this very moment meditating a splendid provision for him elsewhere, prohibited the journey from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> motives. Accordingly, notwithstanding the opposition of the grand chancellor Bestuchew, and indeed of all her ministers, she determined to invest him with the ensigns of royalty. The head of the house of Brandenburgh, swayed by his hatred to Saxony and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a>, or, what is still more likely, the Prussian eagle having perhaps, even now, scented his future prey, Catherine was enabled to send 10,000 men into Poland, who, encamping on the banks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VISTULA\">Vistula</a>, overawed the deliberations of the diet, assembled on the 9th of May 1764, and placed Stanislaus-Augustus on the throne. Thus, by the appearance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a> filled with Russian mercenaries, was violated one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> laws of the commonwealth, established ever since the time of Sigismund-Augustus two centuries before, in consequence of which the election of a king is deemed void while there are any foreign troops within the territories of the republic; and so jealously were the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">Poles</a> of their national independence, that the marshal of the diet, on those occasions, was accustomed to request all ambassadors to absent themselves, as he could not be answerable for the safety of their persons.\n\nHaving conferred the crown of Poland, September 7, 1764, on an amiable and accomplished prince, who, on account of his youth, his poverty, and even his dependence on Russia, would have been excluded from that painful pre-eminence had the free suffrage of the nation been collected; and who was, in consequence of\nCatherine, of the hatred of his countrymen, still more subjected to the dominion of the empress, began to prepare for a war against the Turks, which was accordingly declared in 1768. During this contest the Greek cause was triumphant both by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>. On the first of these elements her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, under Count Orloff, entered the straits of Gibraltar, and carried terror and devastation among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> in the Archipelago, and throughout the defences of shores of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASIA_MINOR\"><a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a>; on the second, her armies, under Galitzin and Romanoff, achieved many important victories, seized on the fortresses of Choczin, and prevailed on the Greek inhabitants of Wallachia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOLDAVIA\">Moldavia</a> to acknowledge her as their sovereign.\n\nIn the meantime, however, a dangerous insurrection broke out in the heart of her dominions, instigated by a Cossack of the name of Pugatcheff, who pretended to be Peter III. After displaying great valour and considerable talents, which had enabled him, at the head of raw and undisciplined levies, to contend against veteran troops and experienced generals, this unfortunate man was at length seized, enclosed in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAGE\">cage</a>, and beheaded at Moscow on the 21st of January 1775.\n\nA peace had been concluded on the 21st of July, in the preceding year, with the Porte, which proved highly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> to Russia; but it was productive of little benefit, for the liberty of navigating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK_SEA\">Black Sea</a>, and a free trade with all the ports of the Turkish empire, which would have afforded inestimable advantages to a civilized people, was scarcely of any consequence to a nation unacquainted alike with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>.\n\nAccordingly, we find her imperial majesty still unsatisfied. Ambition, which in a female bosom is ever insatiable, stimulated her to attempt new acquisitions, and we learn with astonishment that her diplomatic artifices proved infinitely more hostile to the Turkish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRESCENT\">crescent</a>, than even her victorious arms. Scarcely had four years elapsed, when, after an armed negotiation, a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> of pacification was agreed to by the reluctant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SULTAN\">sultan</a>, on the 21st of March, 1779, in consequence of which the Crimea was declared independent: an event not calculated to close ancient jealousies, but, on the contrary, to produce fresh differences, as it afforded an opening into the very heart of the Turkish empire, and a ready pretext for future interference. New claims and new concessions immediately followed. Russia insisted on establishing consuls in the three provinces of Moldavia, Wallachia, and Bessarabia, which she was accordingly permitted to do by the treaty of 1781. Mortifying as this compliance was, it produced but a short respite. The emperor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> was now brought upon the political stage, and the Roman and Russian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAGLES\">eagles</a>, after hovering over the carcass of the Turkish empire, and meditating to devour the whole, were at last content with a part of the prey. The empress, as it may be readily believed, was not indifferent to her own interests, and by the treaty of Constantinople, signed January 9, 1784, to Russia was ceded the entire sovereignty of the Crimea, which then received its ancient name of Taurica, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of Gamara, and part of Cuban.\n\nIt was now in the 58th year of her age, and the 25th of her reign, that Catherine may be said to have attained the very summit of her wishes. There was no one who pretended to the throne, unless her son Paul Petrovitch, an amiable prince, who had attained his 33rd year, without displaying the least symptom of ambition, and who besides was superintended with the most watchful jealousy. She had triumphed over a nation, supposed to be the natural enemy of Russia, both by arms and negotiations, and she dazzled her barbarous subjects with the blaze of her glory, for they were eager to forget her errors, in order to contemplate a grandeur which soothed their national vanity. Knowing the effect of splendour upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, she ushered in the year 1787 with a brilliant journey to Chernov. Accompanied thither at once by a court and an army, with foreign ambassadors, an emperor and a king in her train, she intended to have assumed the high founding titles of Empress of the East, and Liberator of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>. At Kiow, where she remained during three months, she was received under triumphal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>, and, having heard the petitions of the deputies from distant nations, and extended the walls of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, she <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a>, with an arrogant anticipation, the following motto, in Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> next to Constantinople: \"Through this gate lies the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to Byzantium.\"\n\nScarcely, however, had the empress, after visiting Moscow, returned to her capital, than the Turk thought proper to declare war. Her majesty, long since prepared for an event which was far from being displeasing, called forth the stipulated succours of her ally the emperor; and the combined army under the Prince de Cobourg made itself master of Choczin, at the end of a siege of three months. Oczakow, after a still more obstinate resistance, was taken by storm, by the Russians alone. A diversion, however, was made by the king of Sweden, who, subsidized with Turkish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, and directed by Prussian counsels, fought his own battles at the expense of his ally. But the exertions of this monarch were principally confined to the indecisive naval actions of Stoogland, in which both parties claimed the victory, and this was soon after followed by a convention for peace.\n\nDismayed by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>, if not a powerful enemy, the empress no longer confined her conquests to the course of the Danube, but crowned the campaign with the capture of Ilmael, which was taken by storm on the 22nd of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>. On this occasion Suvarrow, one of her favourite generals, displayed a horrid mixture of courage and cruelty, and thus proved, to a demonstration, that personal bravery is far from being incompatible with the deadliest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a>. Incensed at the gallant resistance of the Turks, like Caesar, he snatched a standard from a furlantern, and planted it with his own hand on the walls of the city; like Sylla, he doomed the vanquished to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> a bloody proscription, and upwards of 30,000 men, women, and children, if we are to credit the boastful account of the barbarians themselves, perished by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> and bayonet of the unsparing Russians.\n\nInstead of regaining the Crimea, as had been expected by the sultan, the fortresses of Oczakow, and all the territories between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> Bog and Dnieper, were assigned to the empress, who now found herself nearer\nCatherine, nearer to that Byzantium, on which she had so eagerly fixed her eye, by a whole campaign, than at the commencement of hostilities.\n\nHaving concluded a final treaty of peace with the Turk, on the 9th of January 1792, by which the river Dnieper became the boundary of the two empires, and was to be navigated by both, the empress had more time to apply her attention to European politics. Part of Poland had been dismembered and partitioned during the year 1772, not only in contravention to the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of nations, but in direct opposition to the most solemn treaties on the part of Russia, Prussia, and Austria. The revolution which took place in that ill-fated country on May 3, 1791, and which afforded the prospect of a happy and stable government to the remains of the republic, was the signal of its annihilation. The imperial and royal spoilers feasted this opportunity to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> once more in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> on their prey, which they forced to expire under their talons; and they have since cut it into shares, and attempted to disfigure it by new names, lest it should one day be reclaimed by the lawful owners. After this insult to humanity, Stanislaus, whom posterity may acknowledge as an unfortunate, but surely not as a great king, was forced soon after to abdicate, and allowed to retire into obscurity with his mitre, his children, and a pension.\n\nAnother great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> had for some time engaged the attention of Catherine and her cabinet. This was the French revolution; an event pregnant with consequences that involved the claims, or, more properly speaking, the existence of all the sovereigns of Europe. With a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a> nearly exhausted by the war with the Ottoman Porte, which was not then terminated, and at a distance from the scene of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, the empress could not well engage in the contest; but she readily entered into the coalition, and soon after subsidized her late enemy the king of Sweden; but that enterprising prince met his fate, on the night of the 16th of March 1792, by the hand of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSASSIN\">assassin</a>.\n\nNotwithstanding this sinister event, the head of the Greek church, compassionating the fate of the pretended father of the Christian world, promised to exert herself for the restoration of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVIGNON\">Avignon</a> to the holy see. She also launched forth a menacing manifesto against France, and prepared for a new war.\n\nThe empress has hitherto been contemplated in her public character. It may not be amiss now to fix our eyes on the individual; to pay some attention to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a> of the sovereign, and, viewing majestically as it were in an undress, behold the woman lurking behind the princess.\n\nIt might have been supposed, that in the neighborhood of the Hyperborean regions, the passions, if not dormant, would be at least moderate, and that the men would consequently be temperate, and the women chaste. The contrary, however, is the case: and it is left to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> to determine, whether the double windows and heated rooms of St Petersburg, added to an affectation of oriental manners, be not to the full as critical, in respect to female <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURIN\">Turin</a>. Certain it is, however, that, during the reign of Catherine II, no remarkable increase of indecorum took place, and that any occasional indiscretions appear to have made but little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on the public mind.\n\nCount Gregory Orloff, distinguished in Russia by the appellation of Gregorevitch, was one of the handsomest men in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">Gratitude</a> and affection both conspired to procure him a favourable reception at court: and from an obscure condition he soon rose to the highest offices of the state, which he, in fact, governed. His opinion in the cabinet was listened to with deference, and he was invested with the supreme military command. Still higher honours awaited him. The empress-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> was solicited to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> him a diploma of prince of the empire; it was next in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> to decorate him with the titles of duke of Ingria and Carelia, and the chancellor Besluchoff actually proposed to the empress that he should be admitted as the partner of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> and throne. But this scheme was blasted by the interference of Count Panin; who, not content with his own remonstrances, invoked the intervention of Razumofsky and Vorontzoff, and found means to divert Catherine from her purpose.\n\nSoon after this the conduct of Orloff began to give dissatisfaction: for he absented himself from court; went but seldom to the palace; resided principally in the country; and, being extremely addicted to hunting, dedicated whole weeks to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a> of the bear. Panin, who had frequently experienced his arrogance, deemed this a happy opportunity to procure his disgrace. He accordingly introduced a young officer named Vasilchikoff, a subaltern in the guards, and advantage was taken of the absence of Orloff to introduce him at the Hermitage. This officer was young and handsome; but nature, which had been lavish to his person, seems to have been at no pains with his mind. He was immediately appointed chamberlain to the empress, enriched with splendid presents, and treated with the most flattering attention. In the meantime Gregorevitch, who had been appointed to treat with the Turkish plenipotentiaries relative to a peace, on hearing of this unexpected event, instantly returned to the capital from Fokshani, but was arrested at the gates of Peterburgh, and stripped of all his employments. He, however, experienced the imperial bounty, and received, as a recompense for his submission, the sum of 100,000 rubles in hand, a pension of 150,000 more, a magnificent service of plate; and, to crown the whole, an estate, with 6000 peasants upon it, was made over to him.\n\nVasilchikoff, during 22 months, enjoyed all the distinction belonging to the reigning favourite; but at the end of that period he also found occasion to lament the inconstancy of fortune. This young man had conducted himself with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, for he had never abused his influence. He possessed none of that haughtiness so common to upstarts; and he did not appear\nCAT\n\nCatherine, pear eager to increase his own fortune, or to diminish that of his rivals. Such was his moderation, that, as his elevation excited no envy, so his disgrace was unaccompanied by exultation. His faults are still unknown; and most probably he had ceased to please. His retreat, however, was accompanied by every mark of respect; and as he repaired to Moscow, the place of his destined exile, he received presents on his journey, which might be styled imperial on account of their magnificence.\n\nNo sooner was this change made public than Orloff appeared once more on the scene, and was readmitted to all his former influence. Supposing Panin to be the cause of his late exile, he extorted a promise from his royal mistress to dismiss him from all his employments. Her assent was given with reluctance; and the prayers of the grand duke, who was too generous to suffer his preceptor to fall a prey to the suspicions of a man he did not love, induced her to revoke her intentions.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time the manly air and elegant appearance of Potemkin made a great impression on an illustrious personage. This officer had been bred in the guards; and, perceiving on that memorable day when the empress mounted on a fine charger and dressed in regimentals, exhibited herself at the head of the troops, that she had forgotten to place a plume in her hat, he snatched this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECORATION\">decoration</a> from his own, and presented it to the new sovereign. Neither this action, nor the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> with which it was performed, had escaped unnoticed; and the time was now arrived when his attachment was to receive an ample remuneration.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> of favourite is almost peculiar to Russia, and was during many years considered as an official employment. Ever since 1730 the nation had been governed by women, except during the short and unfortunate reign of Peter III. In fine, it seemed to be sanctioned, if not by a fundamental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of the empire, at least by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESCRIPTION\">prescription</a>; as four empresses had successively consecrated it by their practice, and the age of the last Elizabeth made it be considered in some measure as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> appendage to imperial grandeur.\n\nPotemkin soon grew giddy with success, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> and presumption keeping pace with his elevation, he accordingly exposed himself to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of disagreeable events. Boasting one day of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of his power, in presence of Count <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXIS\">Alexis</a> Orloff, the brother of his predecessor, he received a blow which deprived him of an eye; and Prince Gregory Orloff having requested his dismission, he was forced to repair to Smolensk, at once the place of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATIVITY\">nativity</a> and exile. Such was his vexation, partly from the loss of his eye, and partly from his disgrace, that he actually entertained some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> monk; but a submissive letter produced his recall; and from that moment he seemed to have dropped all thoughts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COWL\">cowl</a>.\n\nAmbition now appears to have taken complete possession of the bosom of Potemkin; and this was amply gratified, for his influence soon extended to every department of the state, and he himself, after procuring the dismission of Count Zachar Chernicheff, became vice-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> at war, with a seat in the council. But his aspiring hopes were not yet gratified, for he entertained still higher expectations.\n\nWith a view to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a> of these, he affected to be once more seized with a fit of religion; and kept <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENT\">Lent</a> with great strictness, living upon roots Catherine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> during that holy season. He also wore all the saints in the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALENDAR\">calendar</a> with his prayers; went daily to confession; and, having selected on this occasion the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> that afforded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTION\">absolution</a> to a great personage, he beheld him to inform her, that his alarmed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> could no longer permit him to indulge in an intercourse, which, by marriage alone, would cease to become criminal.\n\nThis project, however, failed of success; and, soon after the empress's return to Petersburg (for it was at Moscow that it had been first conceived), a young man from the Ukraine, of the name of Zavadoffsky, was honoured with the imperial countenance, while the haughty Potemkin received the customary intimation, \"that he must prepare to travel.\" Potemkin did not dare to disobey; but he evaded the order; for, setting out in great form, he proceeded a few miles towards the place indicated for his exile, but returned in the course of next day, and placed himself in the evening exactly opposite to the empress as she was about to sit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to whist. Every one expected to behold some signal mark of the imperial displeasure; but, on the contrary, Catherine, handing him a pack of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDS\">cards</a>, defied the ex-favourite to cut in, observing that he had always been a fortunate player. His posts, his honours, his influence, were all restored to him, and he now occupied a new situation about the person of her imperial majesty, for he became her friend.\n\nIn the mean time the bosom of the humble Zavadoffsky began to catch the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> of ambition; and, as he was jealous of the grandeur of Potemkin, he aimed at a deadly blow at his consequence. But the minister at war, become wily in his turn, warded it off, and made it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOIL\">recoil</a> on the head of his rival. Perceiving a handsome young Servian officer of hussars, of the name of Zoritch, who had repaired to Petersburg in search of promotion, he presented him with a captain's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>, and in a few days he was perceived behind the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> of the empress. A large estate, the rank of major-general, and an immense sum of money, soon became the appanage of this fortunate youth; but the empress perceiving that he was ignorant, and being disgusted at his want of accomplishments, recommended, as he could speak no language but that of the Russian boors, that he should be sent abroad for improvement.\n\nFortune seems to have been in a playful mood when she elevated Rimsky Korzakoff to the post of chamberlain, and successor to the Servian. This man had actually been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERGEANT\">sergeant</a> in the guards; he was now declared aide-de-camp general to the empress, and presented with the palace of Vasilchikoff.\n\nHe proved to be a vain upstart, whose dress exhibited a profusion of diamonds, and whose conduct was such as could not fail to involve him in ruin. This speedily occurred; for, being detected in a secret correspondence with a lady, he was banished from court, and he was obliged to repair to Moscow.\n\nThe same day that beheld his disgrace, witnessed the good fortune of Lantkoi, a Pole by descent, and an officer of the body guards by profession. The education of this young man had been neglected; but this defect was in some measure remedied by the zeal and attachment of an illustrious personage, who superintended...\nCatherine tended his improvement; and in a short time he became as remarkable for the superior elegance of his manners, as the graces of his person: but, while in the flower of his youth, and the very height of his favour, he was attacked by a mortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, which cut him off after a short illness. He died in the arms of his mistress, who was inconsolable on the occasion, and refused to take any sustenance during three whole days.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAUSOLEUM\">mausoleum</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of which was sketched out by an English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>, attested the respect of the empress, who burst into tears on seeing it two years after. His fortune he had bequeathed to her imperial majesty, but she presented it, with her accustomed generosity, to the father of this handsome youth.\n\nThe next person who aspired to the post of favourite was a young man educated in Scotland, and who had become a fellow of the Royal Society of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. This was Prince Dalhoff, son to the celebrated princes of the same name, who had participated in the memorable revolution that levelled Peter III. with the dust. A lieutenant of the name of Yermoloff anticipated him, however, in this post, to which he was raised by the interest of Potemkin; but, proving ungrateful to his benefactor, he was suddenly disgraced, being replaced by Momonoff, who attended her imperial majesty during her journey to the Crimea. He fell in love, however, with a lady of the court; and no sooner was the empress informed of this circumstance, than she insisted on his marrying her immediately; after which they were sent into exile at Moscow.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> Zuboff, an officer of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> guards, supplied his place. This aspiring young man, not content with wealth and honours, affected public employments; and it is asserted that the idea of the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of Poland originated with him. In a short time he became omnipotent at Peterburgh. He was decorated with the title of prince; received the post of grand master of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>; all the admirals, generals, and ministers of the empire, were to be seen at his levee <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> lowly before him; and, if we are to believe the author of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of some reputation, paying their compliments at the same time, in great form, to his favourite monkey.\n\nCatherine hitherto had only afforded empty promises to the enemies of France; but, at the instigation of Zuboff, she now formed the design of giving effectual assistance to the confederated kings; and, as a proof of her intentions, issued orders for a squadron of men of war to join the English fleet, and commanded a levy of 60,000 troops. She at the same time prosecuted a war on the frontiers of Persia, where her army, under the command of a near relation of the grand master of the artillery, had experienced a most humiliating defeat; and she was now preparing to send fresh succours to his assistance.\n\nSuch were the projects that occupied the mind of Catherine, the overthrow of the French republic, and the subjugation of the distant Persians, when she was smitten by the hand of death. This fortunate princess had hitherto enjoyed an almost uninterrupted state of good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> during the whole of her long reign. She was sometimes, indeed, subject to a colic, and her legs were now and then observed to swell; but neither of these symptoms were alarming.\n\nOn the morning of the 9th of November she rose at her usual hour, and breakfasted on coffee according to Catherine's custom. Some time after she retired to her closet, and her long absence affording cause of suspicion to her attendants, they entered the apartment and found her lying speechless. Dr Rogeron, her physician, being sent for, he treated her disease as an apoplexy; and considerable relief seemed to ensue after the application of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANCET\">lancet</a>. But the empress never entirely recovered her senses; and did not utter a single word during the remainder of her life, which was prolonged to ten o'clock in the evening of November 10, 1797.\n\nThus, with her usual good fortune, after a very short illness, died Catherine II., empress of all the Russias. During her youth she had been extremely handsome, but the got fat as she increased in years; she, however, preserved a certain air of gracefulness, intermingled with dignity, until the last moment of her life.\n\nHer majesty in person was not above the middle size, but, being well proportioned and carrying her head high, she appeared tall. Her forehead was open, her nose aquiline, her mouth agreeable, and her chin, without being ugly, was rather long. Her hair, in which she took great delight, was auburn, and her eye-brows dark and thick. Her eyes, according to some, were blue, while others insist that they were of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> hue. Upon the whole, her physiognomy was not deficient in expression; but she had such a command of her countenance, that no one could there discover the secrets of her heart.\n\nHer imperial majesty was accustomed, on great occasions, to dress in a splendid manner, and to wear a profusion of jewels. Being particularly fond of diamonds, she possessed a prodigious number; and one in particular was the largest that had ever been seen in Europe. Catherine, however, was accustomed in general to affect the ancient Russian fashions, for the most part wearing green, out of compliment to the nation. Her hair was powdered but lightly. On the other hand, her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> was covered with rouge; and as her imperial majesty, like the ladies in the French court, wore it in proportion to her rank, it is not to be wondered if it was of a high colour.\n\nThe strictest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a> was regularly preserved by Catherine, in a country, and at a court, where a little deviation would not have given occasion to much scandal. A slight breakfast, a moderate dinner, and two or three glasses of wine (for she never indulged in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>), constituted her usual diet.\n\nIt is far more easy to describe the empress than the woman. The acts of the former have now become history, but those of the latter must be left to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> of genius, that can analyze the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> action.\n\nIt must be confessed that both she and the empire appear to have been frequently a prey to favouritism; and this part of her conduct, by being connected with the happiness of millions of her subjects, is highly censurable.\n\nAs a sovereign she stands conspicuous. She increased the extent of Russia, and added not only new countries, but new nations, to that mighty empire. As a conqueror her victories were numerous and brilliant; she triumphed equally by sea and by land, and, had she lived but ten years longer, might have realized\nCatherine, the proud dream of her ambition, and beheld her grandson Constantine sitting on the throne of the Ottomans. Her merit as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a>, too, is great; but she would have been far more worthy of our admiration, had she effected the generous idea of enfranchising all the peasantry of her immense dominions.\n\nShe was the only sovereign of Russia who ever exhibited a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for letters. This was not all; she was an author herself, and did not disdain to compose little treatises for her grandchildren, whose education she superintended.\n\nFor music she also possessed an exquisite relish, and brought Gabrielli, and a number of singers of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, allowing them liberal salaries, and treating them with great attention. Throughout the whole of her long reign Catherine also evinced a marked predilection for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>. In the midst of a war with the Turks she purchased pictures in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, to the amount of 60,000 rubles, all of which were lost in consequence of a ship's being wrecked on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINLAND\">Finland</a>. This, however, rather served to stimulate her to fresh exertions, and her agents accordingly procured whatever was to be found in Italy worthy of notice. The Houghton collection from England was also transferred, by an act of her munificence, to the shores of the Baltic; and, while it added to her glory, disgraced this nation, in the eyes of foreigners.\n\nHer conduct to learned men was truly worthy of a woman of genius. She was proud of the correspondence and friendship of Voltaire; she invited Diderot to her court, and lived with him, while there, in habits of the utmost familiarity; to D'Alembert she looked up as to a superior being, and endeavoured, although in vain, to seduce him to reside at St Peterburgh; but he possessed a haughty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>, was devoted to liberty, and would not consent to degrade the mind of a freeman, by residing among a nation of slaves.\n\nTo the honour of Catherine, she was extremely attentive to the education of her people, and instituted a prodigious number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> for their instruction. To remove their prejudices against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INOCULATION\">inoculation</a>, she herself submitted to the operation, and thus hazarded her life for her nation. Amidst the schemes of grandeur, the allurements of power, and the gratification of the passions, she found leisure to civilize and instruct her subjects; this added not a little to her glory, as it contributed to the benefit of so large a portion of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>; but it will infallibly operate against a despotic government, by rendering the boors unfit for their chains, which they will some day <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a>, perhaps, on the heads of the boyars, who at once enslave and oppress them.\n\nNo woman could so easily forgive, and in this point of view her conduct must be allowed to have possessed a great share of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a>. She generously pardoned old Munich and Godowitz, the one the counsellor, the other the favourite of Peter III. She even admitted the former of these into her confidence, and would have conferred honours and preferments on the latter; but he loved his late sovereign, and with a noble scorn spurned at the proffered friendship of his successor. To the misfortunes of Peter III., although her own rival, she granted her life, restored her fortune, and at length admitted her daughters to honourable situations at court.\n\nNo personage in our own times has attracted a greater share of censure and eulogium than Catherine; and no woman in any age ever exhibited more of the masculine greatness of one sex, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMININE\">feminine</a> weakness of another. As a female, she appears at times the slave of passion, and the puppet of her courtiers; but while we behold her diminishing, in this point of view, into insignificance, we look again, and contemplate the sovereign, towering like an immense colossus, and with one foot placed on Cherlon, and another at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KAMTSCHATKA\">Kamtschatka</a>, waving her iron sceptre over the subject nations, and regulating the destiny of a large portion of mankind.\n\nThe frailties, however, of the woman will soon be forgotten, while the glory that encircles the brows of the legislator and conqueror will long continue to dazzle the eyes of an admiring world. The present age, however, flutters at the untimely fate of Peter and of Iwan, and posterity will not easily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a> of Stanislaus, the partition of Poland, and the massacres of Ismailow and of Praga.","sp":276,"ep":288},{"h":"CATHERINE","t":"Order of St., in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, belongs to ladies of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> in the Russian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>.

Valce ascribes the origin of it to Alphonso in 738. Some allege that it was used only since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of Ferdinand and Isabella. Colombiere says, it was given them on occasion of the expulsion of the Moors. The Bollandists pretend it had been borne by their predecessors the Visigoth kings of Spain; and that Alexander VI. only renewed it to Ferdinand and Isabella. Others say that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> de Valois first bore the title; which was given him after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a>, on account of his favouring their interests.\n\nIn some epistles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> popes, the title catholic is given to the kings of France and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, as well as to several patriarchs and primates.\n\nCatholicon, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARMACY\">Pharmacy</a>, a kind of soft purgative electuary, so called, as being supposed an universal purger of all humours.\n\nCatiline, Lucius, a Roman of a noble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, who, having spent his whole fortune in debauchery, formed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of oppressing his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, destroying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>, seizing the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>, setting Rome on fire, and usurping a sovereign power over his fellow citizens. In order to succeed in this design, he drew some young noblemen into his plot; whom he prevailed upon, it is said, to drink <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> blood as a pledge of their union. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a>, however, was discovered by the vigilance of Cicero, who was then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a>. Upon which, retiring from Rome, he put himself at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, with several of the conspirators, and fought with incredible valour against Petreius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> to Antony, who was colleague with Cicero in the consulship; but was defeated and killed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>. See (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of) Rome.\u2014Sallust has given an excellent history of this conspiracy.\n\nCato, Marcus Porcius, the censor, one of the greatest men among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, was born at Tusculum in the year of Rome 519, about the 23rd before Christ. He began to bear arms at 17; and, on all occasions, showed extraordinary courage. He was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of great sobriety, and reckoned no bodily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> unworthy of him. He had but one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> for himself and his baggage, and he looked after and dressed it himself. At his return from his campaigns, he took himself to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a> his ground; not that he was without slaves to do it, but it was his inclination. He dressed also like his slaves, sat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> with them, and partook of the same fare. He did not in the meanwhile neglect to cultivate his mind, especially in regard to the art of speaking; and he employed his talents, which were very great, in generously pleading causes in the neighbouring cities without fee or reward. Valerius Flaccus, who had a country seat near Cato, conceiving an esteem for him, persuaded him to come to Rome; where Cato, by his own merit, and the influence of so powerful a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a>, was soon taken notice of, and promoted. He was first of all elected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUNE\">tribune</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>; he was next made quaestor in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a> under Scipio. Having in this last office reproved him for his profuseness to his soldiers, the general answered, that \"he did not want to exact a quid pro quo, but would make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> at what expense he pleased; nor was he to give an account to the Roman people of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> he spent, but of his enterprises, and the execution of them.\" Cato, provoked at this answer, left Sicily, and returned to Rome.\n\nAfterwards Cato was made praetor, when he fulfilled the duties of his office with the strictest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. He conquered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDINIA\">Sardinia</a>, governed with admirable moderation, and was created consul. Being tribune in the war of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, he gave distinguished proofs of his valour against Antiochus the Great; and at his return stood candidate for the office of censor. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a>, who not only envied him as a new man, but dreaded his severity, set up against him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> powerful competitors. Valerius Flaccus, who had introduced him into public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, and had been his colleague in the consulship, was a ninth candidate, and these two united their interests. On this occasion Cato, far from employing soft words to the people, or giving hopes of gentleness or complaisance in the execution of his office, loudly declared from the rostra, with a threatening look and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, \"That the times required firm and vigorous magistrates to put a stop to that growing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> which menaced the republic with ruin; censors who would cut up the evil by the roots; and restore the rigour of ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>.\" It is to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the people of Rome, that notwithstanding these terrible intimations, they preferred him to all his competitors, who courted them by promises of a mild and easy administration; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMITIA\">comitia</a> also appointed his friend Valerius to be his colleague, without whom he had declared that he could not hope to compass the reforms he had in view. Cato's merit, upon the whole, was superior to that of any of the great men who stood against him. He was temperate, brave, and indefatigable; frugal of the public money, and not to be corrupted. There is scarce any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> requisite for public or private life which he had not received from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, or acquired by industry. He was a great soldier, an able statesman, an eloquent orator, a learned historian, and very knowing in rural affairs. Yet, with all these accomplishments, he had very great faults. His ambition being poisoned with envy, disturbed both his own peace and that of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> as long as he lived. Though he would not take bribes, he was unmerciful and unconciliatory in amassing wealth by all such means as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> did not punish.\n\nThe first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of Cato in his new office, was naming his colleague to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of the senate: after which the censors struck out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of the senators the names\nnames of seven persons; among whom was Lucius the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> of T. Flaminius. Lucius, when consul, and commanding in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a>, had with his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> murdered a Boian of distinction, a deserter to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>; and he had committed this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> purely to gratify the curiosity of his pathic, a young Carthaginian, who longing to see somebody die a violent death, had reproached the general for bringing him away from Rome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> when there was going to be a fight of gladiators. Titus Flaminius, full of indignation at the dishonour done to his brother, brought the affair before the people; and insisted upon Cato's giving the reason of his proceeding. The censor related the story; and when Lucius denied the fact, put him to his oath. The accused, refusing to swear, was deemed guilty; and Cato's censure was approved. But no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the censor's conduct seemed so cruel to the nobles and their wives as the taxes he laid upon luxury in all its branches; drefs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a> furniture, women's toilets, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARIOTS\">chariots</a>, slaves, and equipage. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> were all taxed at three per cent. of the real value. The people, however, in general, were pleased with his regulations; inasmuch that they ordered a statue to be erected to his honour in the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">Health</a>, with an inscription that mentioned nothing of his victories or triumphs, but imported only, that by his wife ordinances in his censorship he had reformed the manners of the republic. Plutarch relates, that before this, upon some of Cato's friends expressing their surprise, that when many persons without merit or reputation had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a>, he had none; he answered, \"I had much rather it should be asked why the people have not erected a statue to Cato, than why they have.\" Cato was the occasion of the third Punic war. Being despatched to Africa to terminate a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the Carthaginians and the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMIDIA\">Numidia</a>, on his return to Rome he reported that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a> was grown excessively rich and populous, and he warmly exhorted the senate to destroy a city and republic, during the existence of which Rome could never be safe. Having brought from Africa some very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> figs, he showed them to the conscript fathers in one of the lapses of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOWN\">gown</a>. \"The country (says he), where this fine fruit grows is but a three days voyage from Rome.\" We are told, that from this time he never spoke in the senate upon any subject, without concluding with these words, \"I am also of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that Carthage ought to be destroyed.\" He judged, that for a people debauched by prosperity, nothing was more to be feared than a rival state, always powerful, and now from its misfortunes grown wise and circumspect. He held it necessary to remove all dangers that could be apprehended from without, when the republic had within so many distempers threatening her destruction.\n\nFrom the censor dignified and severe, the reader <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not perhaps be disheartened to turn his view upon Cato sociable and relaxed. For we should have a false notion of him, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we imagined that nothing but a sad austerity prevailed in his speech and behaviour. On the contrary, he was extremely free; and often with his friends at table intermixed the conversation with lively discourses and witty sayings. Of these Plutarch has collected a pretty large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>; we shall relate but one, and make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of Balzac's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAPHRASE\">paraphrase</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a> with which he introduces it. \"The very censors, though sadness seemed to be one of the functions of their office, did not altogether lay aside railing. They were not always bent upon severity; and the first Cato, that troublesome and intolerable honest man, ceased sometimes to be troublesome and intolerable. He had some glimpses of mirth, and some intervals of good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>. He dropped now and then some words that were not unpleasant, and you may judge of the rest by this. He had married a very handsome wife; and history tells us that she was extremely afraid of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>, and loved her husband well. These two passions prompted her to the same thing; she always pitched upon her husband as a sanctuary against thunder, and threw herself into his arms at the first noise she fancied she heard in the sky. Cato, who was well pleased with the storm, and very willing to be careful, could not conceal his joy. He revealed that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> secret to his friends; and told them one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, speaking of his wife, \"that she had found out a way to make him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>; and that he never was so happy as when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> was angry.\" It is worth observing, that this was during his censorship; when he degraded the senator Manlius, who would probably have been consul the year after, only for giving a kiss to his wife in the day time, and in the presence of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>.\n\nCato died in the year of Rome 604, aged 85. He wrote several works. 1. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMAN_HISTORY\">Roman History</a>. 2. Concerning the art of war. 3. Of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a>. 4. A treatise of husbandry. Of these, the last only is extant.\n\nCato, Marcus Porcius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called Cato <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a>, or Cato of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UTICA\">Utica</a>, was great-grandson of Cato the Censor. It is said, that from his infancy he discovered by his speech, by his countenance, and even his childish sports and recreations, an inflexibility of mind; for he would force himself to go through with whatever he had undertaken, though the task was ill suited to his strength. He was rough towards those that flattered him, and quite untractable when threatened; was rarely seen to laugh, or even to smile; was not easily provoked to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>; but if once incensed, hard to be pacified. Sylla having had a friendship for the father of Cato, sent often for him and his brother, and talked familiarly with them. Cato, who was then about 14 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, seeing the heads of great men brought there, and observing the sights of those that were present, asked his preceptor, \"Why does nobody kill this man?\" Because, said the other, he is more feared than he is hated. The boy replied, Why then did you not give me a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> when you brought me hither, that I might have stabbed him, and freed my country from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>?\n\nHe learned the principles of the Stoic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, which so well suited his character, under Antipater of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRE\">Tyre</a>, and applied himself diligently to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of it. Eloquence he likewise studied, as a necessary means to defend the cause of justice, and he made a very considerable proficiency in that science. To increase his bodily strength, he insured himself to suffer the extremes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>; and used to make journeys on foot and bare-headed in all seasons. When he was sick, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a> were his only remedies; he shut himself up, and would see nobody till he was well. Though remarkably sober in the beginning of his\nCato's life, making it a rule to drink but once after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>, and then retire; he infensibly contracted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of drinking more freely, and of sitting at table till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>. His friends endeavoured to excuse this, by saying that the affairs of the public engrossed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> all the day; and that, being ambitious of knowledge, he passed the night in the conversation of philosophers. C\u00e6sar wrote, that Cato was once found dead drunk at the corner of a street, early in the morning, by a great number of people who were going to the levee of some great man; and that when, by uncovering his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, they perceived who it was, they blushed for shame: \"You would have thought (added C\u00e6sar), that Cato had found them drunk, not they him.\" Pliny observes, that by this reflection C\u00e6sar praises his enemy at the same time that he blames him. And Seneca, his extravagant panegyrist, ventures to assert, that it is easier to prove <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRUNKENNESS\">drunkenness</a> to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, than Cato to be vicious. He affected singularity; and in things indifferent, to act directly contrary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and fashions of the age. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">Magnanimity</a> and confidence are generally ascribed to him; and Seneca would fain make that heighten his contempt for others which, in Cato, accompanied those virtues, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of praise. Cato, says Seneca, having received a blow in the face, neither took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> nor was angry; he did not even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> the affront, but denied that he had received it. His virtue raised him so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, that injury could not reach him. He is reputed to have been chaste in his youth. His first love was Lepida; but when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> was upon the point of being concluded, Metellus Scipio, to whom she had been promised, interfered, and the preference was given to him. This affront extremely exasperated our Stoic. He was for going to law with Scipio; and when his friends had diverted him from that design, by showing him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> of it, he revenged himself by making verses upon his rival. When this first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> subsided, he married Attilia the daughter of Serranus, had two children by her, and afterwards divorced her for her very imperfect conduct.\n\nHe served as a volunteer under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALLUS\">Gallus</a> in the war of Spartacus; and when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> rewards were offered him by the commander, he refused them, because he thought he had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to them. Some years after, he went a legionary tribune into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACEDONIA\">Macedonia</a> under the praetor Rubrius: in which station he appeared, in his dress, and during a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a>, more like a private soldier than an officer: but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of his manners, the elevation of his sentiments, and the superiority of his views, set him far above those who bore the titles of generals and proconsuls. It is said, that Cato's design in all his behaviour was to engage the soldiers to the love of virtue; whose affections he engaged thereby to himself, without his having that in his intention. \"For the sincere love of virtue,\" (adds Plutarch) \"implies an affection for the virtuous. Those who praise the worthy without loving them, pay homage to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>; but are neither admirers nor imitators of their virtues.\" When the time of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> expired, and he was leaving the army, the soldiers were all in tears; for effectually had he gained their hearts by his condescending manners, and sharing in their labours. After his return home, he was chosen to the qu\u00e6storship; and had scarce entered on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>, when he made a great reformation in the qu\u00e6stor's office, and particularly with regard to the registers. These registers, whose places were for life, and through whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> passed incessantly all the public accounts, being to act under young magistrates inexperienced in business, assumed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of importance; and, instead of taking orders from the qu\u00e6stors, pretended to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> and govern as if they themselves were the qu\u00e6stors. Cato reduced them to their proper sphere.\n\nOne thing by which Cato extremely pleased the people, was his making the affluents to whom Sylla had given considerable rewards out of the treasury for murdering the proscribed, disgorge their gains. Plutarch tells us, that Cato was so exact in discharging the duties of a senator, as to be always the first who came to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, and the last who left it; and that he never quitted Rome during those days when the senate was to sit. Nor did he fail to be present at every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> of the people, that he might awe those who, by an ill judged facility, bestowed the public money in large gifts, and frequently, through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> favour, granted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMISSION\">remission</a> of debts due to the state. At first his austerity and stiffness displeased his colleagues; but afterwards they were glad to have his name to oppose to all the unjust solicitations, against which they would have found it difficult to defend themselves. Cato very readily took upon him the task of refusing.\n\nCato, to keep out a very bad man, put in for the tribunate. He sided with Cicero against Catiline, and opposed C\u00e6sar on that occasion. His enemies sent him to recover Cyprus, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a> had forfeited, thinking to hurt his reputation by so difficult an undertaking; yet none could find fault with his conduct.\n\nCato laboured to bring about an agreement between C\u00e6sar and Pompey; but seeing it in vain, he sided with the latter. When Pompey was slain he fled to Utica; and being pursued by C\u00e6sar, advised his friends to be gone, and throw themselves on C\u00e6sar's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLEMENCY\">clemency</a>. His son, however, remained with him; and Statilius, a young man, remarkable for his hatred to C\u00e6sar.\n\nThe evening before the execution of the purpose he had formed with regard to himself, after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a>, he supped with his friends and the magistrates of the city. They sat late at table, and the conversation was lively. The discourse falling upon this maxim of the Stoics, that \"the wife man alone is free, and that the vicious are slaves?\" Demetrius, who was a Peripatetic, undertook to confute it from the maxims of his school. Cato in answer, treated the matter very amply; and with so much earnestness and vehemence of voice, that he betrayed himself, and confirmed the suspicions of his friends that he designed to kill himself. When he had done speaking, a melancholy silence ensued; and Cato perceiving it, turned the discourse to the present situation of affairs, expressing his concern for those who had been obliged to put to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, as well as for those who had determined to make their escape by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, and had a dry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SANDY_DESERT\"><a class=\"xr</a>ef\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>. After supper, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> being dismissed, he walked for some time with a few friends, and gave his orders to the officers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a>; and going into his chamber, he embraced his son and his friends with more than usual\nusual tendernefs, which farther confirmed the suspic-\ntions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> he had taken. Then laying\nhimself down on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, he took up <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALOGUE\">Dialogue</a>\non the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">Immortality</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">Soul</a>. Having read for fome\ntime, he looked up, and missing his sword, which his\nfon had removed while he was at supper, he called a\nslave, and asked who had taken it away; and receiving\nno pertinent anfwer, he resumed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a>. Some\ntime after, he asked again for his sword; and, without\nshowing any impatience, ordered it to be brought to\nhim: but, having read out the book, and finding no-\nbody had brought him his sword, he called for all his\nservants, fell into a rage, and struck one of them on the\nmouth with fo much violence that he very much hurt his\nown hand, crying out in a passionate manner, \"What!\ndo my own fon and family confpire to betray me, and\ndeliver me up naked and unarmed to the enemy?\" Im-\nmediately his fon and friends rushed into the room;\nand began to lament, and to befeech him to change\nhis resolution. Cato raising himself, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> fiercely\nat them, \"How long is it,\" said he, \"since I have loft\nmy fenfes, and my fon is become my keeper? Brave\nand generous fon, why do you not bind your father's\nhands, that when Caesar comes, he may find me un-\nable to defend myself? Do you imagine that without\na sword I cannot end my life?\" Cannot I destroy my-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ELF\">elf</a>, by holding my breath for fome moments, or by\nstriking my head against the wall?\" His fon anfwered\nwith his tears, and retired. Apollonides and De-\nmetrius remained with him; and to them he addrefled\nhimself in the following words: \"Is it to watch over\nme that ye fit silent here? Do you pretend to force\na man of my years to live? or can you bring any\nreason to prove, that it is not bafe and unworthy of\nCato to beg his safety of an enemy? or why do you\nnot persuade me to unlearn what I have been taught,\nthat, rejecting all the opinions I have hitherto de-\nfended, I may now, by Caesar's means, grow wifer,\nand be yet more obliged to him than for life alone?\nNot that I have determined any thing concerning my-\nelf; but I would have it in my power to perform\nwhat I fhall think fit to resolve upon: and I fhall not\nfail to ask your counfel, when I have occasion to act\nup to the principles which your philofophy teaches.\nGo tell my fon, that he fhould not compel his father\nto what he cannot persuade him.\" They withdrew,\nand the sword was brought by a young slave. Cato,\ndrew it, and finding the point to be sharp; \"Now,\"\n(faid he), I am my own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>:\" And, laying it\ndown, he took up his book again, which it is re-\nported, he read twice over. After this he flept fo\nfoundly that he was heard to snore by thofe who were\nnear him. About midnight he called two of his freed-\nmen, Cleanthes his phyfician, and Butas whom he\nchiefly employed in the management of his affairs.\nThe laft he fent to the port, to fee whether all the\nRomans were gone; to the phyfician he gave his hand\nto be dreffed, which was fwelled by the blow he had\ngiven his fave. This being an intimation that he\nintended to live, gave great joy to his family. Butas\nfoon returned, and brought word that they were all\ngone except Craflus, who had laid upon fome bufie-\nness, but was juft ready to depart. He added, that\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> was high and the fea rough. These words\ndrew a figh from Cato. He fent Butas again to the\nport, to know whether there might not be fome one,\nwho, in the hurry of embarkation, had forgot fome\nneceffary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, and had been obliged to put back\nto Utica. It was now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> of day, and Cato flept\nyet a little more, till Butas returned to tell him, that\nall was perfectly quiet. He then ordered him to fhut\nhis door; and he fhung himfelf upon his bed, as if he\nmeant to fhift his night's rep; but immediately he\ntook his sword, and stabbed himfelf a little below his\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>; yet not being able to ufe his hand fo well by\nreafon of the fwellings, the blow did not kill him. It\nthrew him into a convulfion, in which he fell from his\nbed, and overturned a table near it. The noise gave\nthe alarm; and his fon and the refi of the family, en-\ntering the room, found him weltering in his blood, and\nhis bowels half out of his body. The furgeon, upon\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, found that his bowels were not cut; and\nwas preparing to replace them and bind up the wound,\nwhen Cato, recovering his fenfes, thrust the furgeon\nfrom him, and, tearing out his bowels, immediately\nexpired, in the 48th year of his age.\n\nBy this rafh act, independent of all moral or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a>\nconsiderations, he carried his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a> to the highest\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> phrenzy: for Cato, dead, could be of\nno ufe to his country: but had he preferved his life,\nhis counfel might have moderated Caesar's ambition,\nand (as Montefquieu obferves) have given a different\nturn to public affairs.","sp":288,"ep":292},{"h":"CATIVELLAUNI","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> a people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, seated in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> which is now divided into the counties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol10.html#article-HERTFORD\">Hertford</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEDFORD\">Bedford</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUCKS\">Bucks</a>. The name of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> British people is written in several different ways by Greek and Roman authors, being sometimes called Catti, Catii, Catticulcani, Catitudanii, Catticudani, &c. That they were of Belgic origin cannot be doubted, and it is not improbable that they derived their name of Catti from the Belgic word Katten, which signifies illustrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> noble, and that the addition of Vellauni, which means on the banks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, might be given them after their arrival in Britain, as descriptive of the situation of their country. However this may be, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CATTIVELLAUNI\">Cattivellauni</a> formed one of the most brave and warlike of the ancient British nations when Caesar invaded Britain, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> after. Cassibelanus, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, was made commander in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of the confederated Britons, not only on account of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> qualities, but also because he was at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of one of their bravest and most powerful tribes. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between the departure of Caesar and the next invasion under Claudius, the Cattivellauni had reduced several of the neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> under their obedience; and they again took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> in opposition to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> at their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> invasion, under their brave but unfortunate Prince Caractacus. The country of the Cattivellauni was much frequented and improved by the Romans, after it came under their obedience. Verulamium, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, which stood near where St Albans now stands, became a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of great consideration, was honoured with the name and privileges of a municipium or free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, and had magistrates after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of the city of Rome. This place was taken and almost destroyed by the insurgents under Boudicea; but it was afterwards rebuilt, restored to its former splendour; and surrounded with a strong wall, some vestiges of which are still remaining. Duocobriva and Magiaivintum, in the second iter of Antoninus, were probably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUNSTABLE\">Dunstable</a> and Fenny <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STRATFORD\">Stratford</a>, at which places there appear to have been Roman stations. The Salene of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>, a town in the country of the Cattivellauni, was perhaps situated at Sandly, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEDFORDSHIRE\">Bedfordshire</a>, where several Roman antiquities have been found. There were, besides these, several other Roman forts, stations, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> in this country, which it would be tedious to enumerate.

Take off the quicksilver from the mirror that you place at B, for about an inch and a half, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> C, where you are to make a hole in the box of the same size, by which you may easily view its inside. Cover the top of the box with a frame, in which must be placed a transparent glass, covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAUZE\">gauze</a>, on the side next the inner part of the box. Let there be two grooves at the parts E and F to receive the two painted scenes hereafter mentioned. On two pieces of cut palteboard let there be skilfully painted on both sides (see fig. 6. and 7.) any subject you think proper; as woods, gardens, bowers, colonnades, &c. and on two other palteboards, the same subjects on one side only; observing that there ought to be on one of them some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> relative to the subject placed at A, that the mirror placed at D may not reflect the hole at C on the opposite side.\n\nPlace the two boards painted on both sides in the grooves E and F; and those that are painted on one side only against the opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRRORS\">mirrors</a> C and D; and then cover the box with its transparent top. This box should be placed in a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> to have a good effect.\n\nWhen the eye is placed at C, and views the objects on the inside of the box, of which some, as we have said, are painted on both sides, they are successively reflected from one mirror to the other; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a>, for example, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> consists of trees, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> appear like a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> vista, of which the eye cannot discern the end; for each of the mirrors repeating the objects, continually more faintly, contribute greatly to augment the illusion.\n\nIII. Take a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> box ABCD, of about six inches long, and twelve high; cover the inside of it with four of immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> mirrors, which must be placed perpendicular to the bottom of the box CHFD.\n\nPlace certain objects in relief on the bottom of this box; suppose, for example, a piece of fortification, (as fig. 9.) with tents, foldiers, &c. or any other subject that you judge will produce an agreeable effect by its disposition when repeatedly reflected by the mirrors.\n\nOn the top of this box place a frame of glass, in form of the bottom part of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a>, whose base AGEB is equal to the size of the box; its top ILN must form a square of six inches, and should not be more than four or five inches higher than the box. Cover the four sides of this frame with a gauze, that the inside may not be visible but at the top ILN, which should be covered with a transparent glass.\n\nWhen you look into this box through the glass LN, the mirrors that are diametrically opposite each other, mutually reflecting the figures enclosed, the eye beholds a boundless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, completely covered with these objects; and if they are properly disposed, the illusion will occasion <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> small surprize, and afford great entertainment.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">Note</a>, The nearer the opening ILN is to the top of the box, the greater will be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> extent of the subject. The same will happen if the four mirrors placed on the sides of the box be more elevated. The objects, by either of these dispositions, will appear to be repeated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a>, twenty-five, forty-nine times, &c. by taking always the square of the odd numbers of the arithmetical progression 3, 5, 7, 9, &c. as is very easy to conceive, if we remember that the subject enclosed in the box is always in the centre of a square, composed of several others, equal to that which forms the bottom of the box.\n\nOther pieces of the same kind (that is, viewed from above) may be contrived in which mirrors may be placed perpendicular on a triangular, pentagon, or hexagon, (that is, a three, five, or six sided) plane. All these different dispositions, properly directed, as well with regard to the choice as position of the objects, will constantly produce very remarkable and pleasing illusions.\n\nIf instead of placing the mirrors perpendicular, they were to incline equally, so as to form part of a reversed pyramid, the subject placed in the box would then have the appearance of a very extensive globular or many-sided <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>.\n\nIV. On the hexagonal or six-sided plane ABCDEF draw six semi-diameters GA, GB, GC, GD, GE, GF; and on each of these place perpendicularly two plane mirrors, which must join exactly at the centre G, and which placed back to back must be as thin as possible. IV. Surround Decorate the exterior boundary of this piece (which is a multi- at the extremity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> of the hexagon) with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of six columns, that at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> serve to support the mirrors, by grooves formed on their inner sides. (See the profile H). Add to these columns their entablatures, and cover the edifice in such manner as you shall think proper.\n\nIn each one of these six triangular spaces, contained between two mirrors, place little figures of palteboard, in relief, representing such objects as when seen in a hexagonal form will produce an agreeable effect. To these add small figures of enamel; and take particular care to conceal, by some object that has relation to the subject, the place where the mirrors join, which, as we have said before, all meet in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> centre G.\n\nWhen you look into any one of the six openings of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, the objects there contained being repeated six times, will seem entirely to fill up the whole of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>. This illusion will appear very remarkable; especially if the objects made choice of are properly adapted to the effect that is to be produced by the mirrors.\n\nNote, If you place between two of these mirrors part of a fortification, as a curtain and two demi-bastions, you will see an entire citadel, with its six bastions.

This, like many of Aristotle's distinctions, is only a distinction of the various meanings of an ambiguous word: for the efficient, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, the form, and the end, have nothing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, by which they may be accounted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of the same genus; but the Greek word, which we translate\ntranslate *causa*, had these four different meanings in Aristotle's days, and we have added other meanings. We do not indeed call the matter or the form of a thing its *causa*; but we have final causes, instrumental causes, occasional causes, and many others. Thus the word *causa* has been so hackneyed, and made to have so many different meanings in the writings of philosophers, and in the discourse of the vulgar, that its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> and proper meaning is lost in the crowd.\n\nWith regard to the phenomena of nature, the important end of knowing their causes, besides gratifying our curiosity, is, that we may know when to expect them, or how to bring them about. This is very often of real importance in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; and this purpose is served, by knowing what, by the course of nature, goes before them and is connected with them; and this, therefore, we call the *causa* of such a phenomenon.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> a magnet be brought near to a mariner's compass, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a>, which was before at rest, immediately begins to move, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENDS\">bends</a> its course towards the magnet, or perhaps the contrary way. If an unlearned sailor is asked the cause of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the needle, he is at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> loss for an answer. He tells you it is the magnet; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> is clear: for, remove the magnet, and the effect ceases; bring it near, and the effect is again produced. It is, therefore, evident to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, that the magnet is the cause of this effect.\n\nA Cartesian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> enters deeper into the cause of this phenomenon. He observes, that the magnet does not touch the needle, and therefore can give it no impulse. He pities the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the sailor. The effect is produced, says he, by magnetic effluvia, or subtle matter, which passes from the magnet to the needle, and forces it from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. He can even show you, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, where these magnetic effluvia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> from the magnet, what round they take, and what way they return home again. And thus he thinks he comprehends perfectly how, and by what cause, the motion of the needle is produced.\n\nA Newtonian philosopher inquires what proof can be offered for the existence of magnetic effluvia, and can find none. He therefore holds it as a fiction, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>; and he has learned that hypothesis ought to have no place in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> of nature. He confesses his ignorance of the real cause of this motion, and thinks that his business as a philosopher is only to find from experiment the laws by which it is regulated in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>.\n\nThese three persons differ much in their sentiments with regard to the real cause of this phenomenon; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> who knows most is he who is sensible that he knows nothing of the matter. Yet all the three speak the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, and acknowledge that the cause of this motion is the attractive or repulsive power of the magnet.\n\nWhat has been said of this, may be applied to every phenomenon that falls within the compass of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> philosophy. We deceive ourselves, if we conceive that we can point out the real efficient cause of any one of them.\n\nThe grandest discovery ever made in natural philosophy, was that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>, which opens such a view of our planetary system, that it looks like something divine. But the author of this discovery was perfectly aware that he discovered no real cause, but only the law or rule according to which the unknown cause operates.\n\nNatural philosophers, who think accurately, have a precise meaning to the terms they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in the science; and when they pretend to show the cause of any phenomenon of nature, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> by the *causa*, a law of nature of which that phenomenon is a necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>.\n\nThe whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of natural philosophy, as Newton expressly teaches, is reducible to these two heads: first, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a> from experiment and observation, to discover the laws of nature; and then to apply those laws to the solution of the phenomena of nature. This was all that this great philosopher attempted, and all that he thought attainable. And this indeed he attained in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, with regard to the motions of our planetary system, and with regard to the rays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>.\n\nBut supposing that all the phenomena which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> within the reach of our senses were accounted for from general laws of nature justly deduced from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>; that is, supposing natural philosophy brought to its utmost perfection; it does not discover the efficient cause of any one phenomenon in nature.\n\nThe laws of nature are the rules according to which the effects are produced; but there must be a cause which operates according to these rules. The rules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> never navigated a ship. The rules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> never built a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>.\n\nNatural philosophers, by great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the course of nature, have discovered many of her laws, and have very happily applied them to account for many phenomena; but they have never discovered the efficient cause of any one phenomenon; nor do those who have distinct notions of the principles of the science make any such pretence.\n\nUpon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a> of nature we see innumerable effects which require an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> endowed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> power; but the agent is behind the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>. Whether it be the Supreme cause alone, or a subordinate cause or causes; and if subordinate causes be employed by the Almighty, what their nature, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, and their different offices may be; are things hid, for wise reasons, without doubt, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> eye.\n\nCause, among civilians, the same with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. See Action.\n\nCause, among physicians. The cause of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> is defined by Galen to be that during the presence of which we are ill, and which being removed, the disorder immediately ceases.

He published several other books both in Latin and French.","sp":307,"ep":307},{"h":"CAUSTICITY","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> belonging to several substances, by the acrimony of which the parts of living animals may be corroded and destroyed. Bodies which have this quality, when taken internally, are true poisons. The causticity of some of these, as of arsenic, is so deadly, that even their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> is proscribed by prudent physicians. Several others, as nitrous acid, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAPIS\">lapis</a> infernalis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> caustic, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> caustic, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a>, are daily and successfully used to consume fungous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, to open ulcers, &c. They succeed very well when properly employed and skilfully managed.\n\nThe causticity of bodies depends entirely on the state of the saline, and chiefly of the acid, matters they contain. When these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> happen to be at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> much concentrated, and slightly attached to the matters with which they are combined, they are then capable of acting, and are corrosive or caustic. Thus fixed and volatile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALKALIES\">alkalies</a>, although they are themselves caustic, become much more so by being treated with quicklime; because this substance deprives them of causticity, all their fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, or carbonic acid to which they owe their mildness. By this treatment, then, the saline principle is more disengaged, and rendered more capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. All <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> of metallic matters with acids form salts more or less corrosive, because these acids are deprived of all their superabundant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and are besides but imperfectly saturated with the metallic matters. Nevertheless, some other circumstance is necessary to constitute the causticity of these saline metallic matters. For the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> acid, which, when pure and diluted with a certain quantity of water, would be productive of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> harm, shall, however, produce all the effects of a corrosive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a>, when it is united with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> in corrosive sublimate, although the sublimate shall be dissolved in so much water that its causticity cannot be attributed to the concentration of its acid. This effect is, by some chemists, attributed to the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of the metallic matters with which the acid is united; and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> is very probable, seeing its causticity is nothing but its dissolving power, or its disposition to combine with other bodies; and this disposition is nothing else than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a>.\n\nOn this subject Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> observes, that the compounds produced by the union of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> with acids are in general corrosive. Many of them applied to the skin destroy it almost as fast as the mineral acids; and some of the most powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POTENTIAL\">potential</a> cauteries are made in this way. Some are reckoned more acid than the pure acids themselves; and they have more powerful effects when taken internally, or at least seem to have. Thus we can take 10 or 12 drops of a fodi acid, diluted with water, without being disturbed by it; but the same quantity of acid previously combined with silver, quicksilver, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, or regulus of antimony, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> throw the body into violent disorders, or even prove a poison, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> taken all at once.\n\nThis increased <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> was, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> philosophers, supposed to arise from the weight of the metallic particles. They imagined that the acid was composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> particles of the shape of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLES\">needles</a> or wedges; by which means they were capable of entering the pores of other bodies, separating their atoms from each other, and thus dissolving them. To these acid spicules the metallic particles gave more force; and the momentum of each particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a> or wedge was increased in proportion to its increase of gravity by the additional weight of the metallic particle. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> is entirely fanciful, and does not correspond with facts. The activity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> is not in proportion to the weight of the metal; nor are the compounds always possessed of any great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of acrimony: neither is it true that any of them have a greater power of destroying animal substances than the pure acids have.\n\nThere is a material <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the powers called stimulants and corrosives. Let a person apply to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the skin a small quantity of lunar caustic, and likewise a drop of strong nitrous acid, and he will find that the acid acts with more violence than the caustic; and the disorders that are occasioned by the compounds of metals and acids do not proceed from a causticity in them, but from the metal affecting and proving a stimulus to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a>: and that this is the\nCautics, appears from their affecting some particular nerves of the body. Thus the compounds of antimony and mercury with the vegetable acids, do not show the smallest degree of acrimony; but, taken internally, they produce violent convulsive motions over the whole body, which are occasioned by the metallic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> having a power of producing this effect; and the acid is only the means of bringing it into a dissolved state, and making it capable of acting on the nervous system. In general, however, the compounds of metallic substances with acids may be considered as milder than the acids in a separate state; but the acid is not so much neutralized as in other compounds, for it is less powerfully attracted by the metal; so that alkaline salts, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> earths, or even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> alone, will decompose them; and some of the inflammable substances, as spirit of wine, aromatic oils, &c., will attract the acid, and precipitate the metal in its metallic form: and the metals can be employed to precipitate one another in their metallic form; so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> of these compounds is much weaker than those formed of the same acids with alkaline salts or earths.","sp":307,"ep":308},{"h":"CAUSTICS","t":"is an appellation given to substances of so hot and fiery a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, that, being applied, consume, and as it were burn, the texture of the parts, like hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>.\n\nCautics are generally divided into four sorts; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> stronger caustic, the common milder caustic, the antimonial caustic, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> caustic.

The Lacedemonians, inhabiting a mountainous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, were but meanly furnished with cavalry, till, carrying their arms into other countries, they found great occasion for horses to support and cover their foot. The Athenian cavalry, for a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, consisted only of 96 horsemen: after expelling the Persians out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, they increased the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> to 300; and afterwards to 1200, which was the highest pitch of the Athenian cavalry.

His father being disappointed of some small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> expectations, was reduced to follow the trade of shoemaker at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUGBY\">Rugby</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARWICKSHIRE\">Warwickshire</a>. The free school of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, in which his son had, by the rules of its foundation, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to be instructed, was then in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> reputation, under the Rev. Mr Holyoak, to whose care most of the neighbouring families, even of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, intrusted their sons. He had judgment to discover, and for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> generosity to encourage, the genius of young Cave; and was so well pleased with his quick progress in the school, that he declared his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to breed him for the university, and recommend him as a servitor to some of his scholars of high rank. But prosperity which depends upon the caprice of others, is of short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>. Cave's superiority in literature exalted him to an invidious familiarity with boys who were far above him in rank and expectations; and, as in unequal associations it always happens, whatever unlucky prank was played was imputed to Cave. When any mischief, great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> small was done, though perhaps others boasted of the stratagem when it was successful, yet upon detection or miscarriage, the fault was sure to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> Cave. The harsh treatment he experienced from this source, and which he bore for a while, made him at last leave the school, and the hope of a literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, to seek some other means of gaining a livelihood.\n\nHe was first placed with a collector of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCISE\">excise</a>; but the insolence of his mistress, who employed him in servile drudgery, quickly disgusted him, and he went up to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> in quest of more suitable employment. He was recommended to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> merchant at the Bankside; and while he was there on liking, is said to have given hopes of great mercantile abilities; but this place he soon left; and was bound apprentice to Mr Collins, a printer of some reputation, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALDERMAN\">alderman</a>. This was a trade for which men were formerly qualified by a literary education, and which was pleasing to Cave, because it furnished some employment for his scholastic attainments. Here, therefore, he resolved to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a>, though his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> and mistress lived in perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCORD\">discord</a>, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> was therefore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> comfortable habitation. From the inconveniences of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> tumults he was soon released, having in only two years attained to much skill in his art, and gained so much the confidence of his master, that he was sent without any superintendant to conduct a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> house at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWICH\">Norwich</a>, and publish a weekly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>. In this undertaking he met with some opposition, which produced a public controversy, and procured young Cave the reputation of a writer.\n\nHis master died before his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPRENTICESHIP\">apprenticeship</a> was expired, and he was not able to bear the perverseness of his mistress. He therefore quitted her house upon a stipulated allowance, and married a young widow, with whom he lived at Bow. When his apprenticeship was over, he worked as a journeyman at the printing-house of Mr Barbar, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> much distinguished and employed by the Tories, whose principles had at that time so much prevalence with Cave, that he was for some years a writer in Mill's Journal. He afterwards obtained by his wife's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> a small place in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST_OFFICE\"><a class=\"x</a>ref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a>-office; but still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, at his intervals of attendance, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> his trade, or to employ himself with some typographical business. He corrected the Gradus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a> Parnassum; and was liberally rewarded by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a>\nCompany of Stationers. He wrote an Account of the Criminals, which had for some time a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>; and published many little pamphlets that accident brought into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, of which it would be very difficult to recover the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>. By the correspondence which his place in the post-office facilitated, he procured a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> newspaper, and sold their intelligence to a journalist in London for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUINEA\">guinea</a> a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>. He was afterwards raised to the office of clerk of the franks, in which he acted with great spirit and firmness; and often stopped franks which were given by members of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> to their friends, because he thought such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of a peculiar right illegal. This raised many complaints; and the influence that was exerted against him procured his ejectment from office. He had now, however, collected a sum sufficient for the purchase of a small printing office, and began the Gentleman's Magazine; an undertaking to which he owed the affluence in which he passed the last 20 years of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> fortune which he left behind him. When he formed the project, he was far from expecting the success which he found; and others had so little prospect of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, that though he had for several years talked of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> among printers and bookellers, none of them thought it worth the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>. That they were not (says Dr Johnson) restrained by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> from the execution of another man's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, was sufficiently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> as soon as that design began to be gainful; for, in a few years, a multitude of magazines arose, and perished; only the London Magazine, supported by a powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> of bookellers, and circulated with all the art and all the cunning of trade, exempted itself from the general fate of Cave's invaders, and obtained though not an equal, yet a considerable sale.\n\nCave now began to aspire to popularity; and being a greater lover of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> than any other art, he sometimes offered subjects for poems, and proposed prizes for the best performers. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> was \u00a350, for which, being but newly acquainted with wealth, and thinking the influence of \u00a350 extremely great, he expected the first authors of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> to appear as competitors; and offered the allotment of the prize to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a>. But, when the time came, no name was seen among the writers that had been ever seen before; and the universities and several private men rejected the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of assigning the prize. The determination was then left to Dr Cromwell Mortimer and Dr Birch; and by the latter the award was made which may be seen in Gent. Mag. vol. vi. p. 59.\n\nMr Cave continued to improve his Magazine, and had the satisfaction of seeing its success proportionate to his diligence, till in 1751, his wife died of an asthma. He seemed not at first much affected by her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, but in a few days lost his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> and his appetite, which he never recovered. After having lingered about two years, with many vicissitudes of amendment and relapse, he fell by drinking acid liquors into a diarrhoea, and afterwards into a kind of lethargic insensibility; and died Jan. 10, 1754, having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> concluded the 23d annual collection.\n\nCAVEARE.

When the first troubles broke out in Scotland, and the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a> was but indifferently provided, he contributed ten thousand pounds, and also raised a troop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, consisting of about two hundred knights and gentlemen, who served at their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>, were commanded by the earl, and honoured with the title of the prince's troop.

On his return to England at the Restoration, he was advanced to the dignity of earl of Ogle, and duke of Newcastle. He spent his time in a country retirement, and was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of men of merit. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> died in 1670, aged 84.

She married the duke of Newcastle abroad in 1645; and on their return after the Restoration, spent the remainder of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> plays, poems, with the life of her husband, to the amount of about a dozen of folios. \"What gives the best idea of unbounded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for scribbling (says Mr Walpole), was her seldom revising the copies of her works, lest, as she said, it should disturb her following conceptions.

In 1679, being re-elected to serve for Derby in a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, Charles II. thought fit to make him a privy counsellor; but he soon withdrew from the board, with his friend Lord Ruffell, when he found that Popish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> prevailed.

He also openly named the king's evil counsellors, and voted for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> to remove them from his presence and councils for ever.

The same fortitude, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of his country, animated this illustrious patriot to oppose the arbitrary proceedings of James II.; and when he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> there was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other method of saving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> from impending <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>, he was the foremost in the association for inviting over the prince of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a>, and the first nobleman who appeared in arms to receive him at his landing. He was created duke of Devonshire in 1694, by William and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>. His last public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> was in the union with Scotland, for concluding of which he was appointed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSIONER\">commissioner</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>. He died in 1707, and ordered the following inscription to be put on his monument.\n\nWilliamus dux Devon,\nBonorum Principum Fidelis Subditus,\nInimicus et Invictus Tyrannis,\nWilliam Duke of Devonshire,\nOf good Princes the faithful Subject,\nThe Enemy and Avenger of Tyrants.\n\nBesides being thus estimable for public virtues, his grace was distinguished by his literary accomplishments. He had a poetical genius, which showed itself particularly in two pieces written with equal spirit, dignity, and delicacy: these are, an ode on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Queen Mary; and an Allusion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">Archbishop</a> of Cambrai's Supplement to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>. He had great knowledge in the languages, was a true judge in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, and a critic in poetry; he had a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> in music, an elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> had a skill equal to any person of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> in which he lived.

A report had prevailed for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> before, that in the interior parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUIANA\">Guiana</a>, there was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> known by the name of El Dorado, which contained immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> and precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>; more than ever Cortez and Pizarro had found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a>; and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> had fired the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. It is supposed that this was the country in quest of which Sir Walter Raleigh went on his last voyage; and as the French were not behind their neighbours in their endeavours to find out so desirable a country, some attempts for this purpose were likewise made by that nation much about the same time; which at last coming to nothing, the adventurers took up their residence on the island of Cayenne. In 1643, some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROUEN\">Rouen</a> united their flock, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to support the new colony; but, committing their affairs to one Poncet de Bretigny, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of a ferocious disposition, he declared <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> both against the colonists and savages, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which he was soon massacred. This catastrophe entirely extinguished the ardour of these associates; and in 1651 a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> was established. This promised to be much more considerable than the former; and they set out with such a capital as enabled them to collect 700 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 800 colonists in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> itself. These embarked on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEINE\">Seine</a>, in order to sail <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAVRE\">Havre</a> de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">Grace</a>; but unfortunately the Abb\u00e9 de Marivaux, a man of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> promoter of the undertaking, was drowned as he was stepping into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>. Another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, who was to have acted as general, was assassinated on his passage, and 12 of the principal adventurers who had promised to put the colony into a flourishing situation, not only were the principal perpetrators of this fact, but uniformly behaved in the same atrocious manner. At last they hanged one of their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>; two died; three were banished to-\nCayenne, Caylus.\n\na <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> island; and the rest abandoned themselves to every kind of excess. The commandant of the citadel deserted to the Dutch with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his garrison. The savages, roused by numberless provocations, fell upon the remainder: so that the few who were left thought themselves happy in escaping to the Leeward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">Islands</a> in a boat and two canoes, abandoning the fort, ammunition, arms and merchandise, fifteen months after they had landed on the island.\n\nIn 1663, a new company was formed, whose capital amounted only to \u00a3750l. By the assistance of the ministry they expelled the Dutch who had taken possession of the island, and settled themselves much more comfortably than their predecessors. In 1667 the island was taken by the English, and in 1676 by the Dutch, but afterwards restored to the French: and since that time it has never been attacked. Soon after some pirates, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with the spoils they had gathered in the South seas, came and fixed their residence at Cayenne; resolving to employ the treasures they had acquired in the cultivation of the lands. In 1688, Ducaffe, an able seaman, arrived with some ships from France, and proposed to them the plundering of Surinam. This proposal exciting their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> turn for plunder, the pirates betook themselves to their old trade, and almost all the rest followed their example. The expedition, however, proved unfortunate. Many of the assailants were killed, and all the rest taken prisoners and sent to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARIBBEE_ISLANDS\">Caribbee islands</a>. This loss the colony has never yet recovered.\n\nThe island of Cayenne is about 16 leagues in circumference, and is only parted from the continent by two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>. By a particular formation, uncommon in islands, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> is highest near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> side, and low in the middle. Hence the land is so full of morasses, that all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> between the different parts of it is impossible, without taking a great circuit. There are some small tracts of an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> to be found here and there; but the generality is dry, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a>, and soon exhausted. The only town in the colony is defended by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVERT\">covert</a> way, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> ditch, a very good mud rampart, and five bastions. In the middle of the town is a pretty considerable eminence, of which a redoubt has been made that is called the fort. The entrance into the harbour is through a narrow channel; and ships can only get in at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> water, through the rocks and reefs that are scattered about this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>.\n\nThe first produce of Cayenne was the arnotto; from the culture of which the colonists proceeded to that of cotton, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a>, and lastly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>. It was the first of all the French colonies that attempted to cultivate coffee. The coffee tree was brought from Surinam in 1721 by some deserters from Cayenne, who purchased their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> by so doing. Ten or twelve years after they planted cocoa. In the year 1752 there were exported from Cayenne 260,541 pounds of arnotto, 80,263 pounds of sugar, 17,919 pounds of cotton, 26,881 pounds of coffee, 91,916 pounds of cocoa, 618 trees for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>, and 104 planks.","sp":308,"ep":309},{"h":"CAYLUS","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> de, Marquis de Sternay, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> de Bronfoc, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> in 1692. He was the eldest of the two sons of John Count de Caylus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> general of the armies of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of France, and of the marchioness de Villette. The count and countess his father and mother were very careful of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> of their son. The former instructed him in the profession of arms, and in bodily exercises; the latter watched over and fostered the virtues of his mind, and this delicate task she discharged with singular success. The countess was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIECE\">niece</a> of Madame de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAINTENON\">Maintenon</a>, and was remarkable both for the solidity of her understanding and the charms of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>. She was the author of that agreeable book entitled \"The Recollections of Madame de Caylus,\" of which Voltaire lately published an elegant edition. The amiable qualities of the mother appeared in the son; but they appeared with a bold and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. In his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> temper he was gay and sprightly, had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for independence, and an invincible aversion to the ferocity of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>. Such were the instructors of the Count de Caylus. He was only twelve years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> when his father died at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSSELS\">Brussels</a> in 1704. After finishing his exercises, he entered into the corps of the Musqueteers; and in his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> in the year 1709, he distinguished himself by his valour in such a manner, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIV. commended him before all the court, and rewarded him with an ensigncy in the Gendarmerie. In 1711 he commanded a regiment of dragoons, which was called by his own name; and he signalized himself at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of it in Catalonia. In 1713, he was at the siege of Fribourg, where he was exposed to imminent danger in the bloody attack of the covered way. The peace of Raftadt having left him in a state of inactivity ill suited to his natural temper, his vivacity soon carried him to travel into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>; and his curiosity was greatly excited by the wonders of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, where antiquity is still fruitful, and produces so many objects to improve taste and to excite admiration. The eyes of the count were not yet learned; but he was struck with the sight of so many beauties, and soon became acquainted with them. After a year's absence, he returned to Paris with so strong a passion for travelling and for antiquities, as induced him to quit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>.\n\nHe had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> sooner quitted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of Louis, than he sought for an opportunity to set out for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVANT\">Levant</a>. When he arrived at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMYRNA\">Smyrna</a>, he visited the ruins of Ephesus. From the Levant he was recalled in February 1717 by the tenderness of his mother. From that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he left not France, but to make two excursions to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. The Academy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">Painting</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SCULPTURE\">Sculpture</a> adopted him an honorary member in the year 1731; and the count, who loved to realize titles, spared neither his labour, nor his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, nor his fortune, to instruct, assist, and animate the artists. He wrote, the lives of the most celebrated painters and engravers that have done <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to this illustrious academy; and, in order to extend the limits of the art, which seemed to him to move in too narrow a circle, he collected, in three different works, new subjects for the painter, which he had met with in the works of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>.\n\nSuch was his passion for antiquity, that he wished to have had it in his power, to bring the whole of it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> again. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> with regret, that the works of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> painters, which have been discovered in our times, are effaced and destroyed almost as soon as they are drawn from the subterraneous mansions where they were buried. A fortunate accident fur-\nCaylus, nished him with the means of showing us the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> and the colouring of the pictures of ancient Rome. The coloured drawings which the famous Pietro Sante Bartoli had taken there from antique pictures, fell into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>. He had them engraved; and, before he enriched the king of France's cabinet with them, he gave an edition of them at his own expense. It is perhaps the most extraordinary book of antiquities that ever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> appear. The whole is painted with a purity and a precision that are inimitable; we see the liveliness and the freshness of the colouring that charmed the Caesars. There were only 30 copies published; and there is no reason to expect that there will hereafter be any more.\n\nCount de Caylus was engaged at the same time in an enterprise still more favourable to Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>, and more interesting to the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>. Colbert had framed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of engraving the Roman antiquities that are still to be seen in the southern provinces of France. By his orders Mignard the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a> had made drawings of them, which Count de Caylus had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> to recover. He resolved to finish the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> begun by Colbert, and to dedicate it to that great minister; and so much had he this enterprise at heart, that he was employed in it during his last illness, and warmly recommended it to M. Mariette.\n\nIn 1742, Count Caylus was admitted honorary member of the Academy of Belles Lettres; and then it was that he seemed to have found the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> for which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> designed him. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of literature now became his ruling passion; he consecrated to it his time and his fortune; he even renounced his pleasures to give himself wholly up to that of making some discovery in the field of antiquity. But amidst the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of his research and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, nothing seemed more flattering to him than his discovery of encaustic painting. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of Pliny's, but too concise a one to give him a clear view of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, suggested the idea of it. He availed himself of the friendship and skill of M. Magault, a physician in Paris, and an excellent chemist; and by repeated experiments found out the secret of incorporating wax with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> tints and colours, and of making it obedient to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a>. Pliny has made mention of two kinds of encaustic painting practised by the ancients; one of which was performed with wax, and the other upon ivory, with hot punches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>. It was the former that Count Caylus had the merit of reviving; and M. Muntz afterwards made many experiments to carry it to perfection.\n\nIn the hands of Count Caylus, literature and the arts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> each other a mutual aid. But it would be endless to give an account of all his works. He published above 40 dissertations in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the Academy of Belles Lettres. The artists he was particularly attentive to; and to prevent their falling into mistakes from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of costume, which the ablest of them have sometimes done, he founded a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> of 500 livres, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of which is to explain, by means of authors and monuments, the usages of ancient nations. In order that he might enjoy with the whole world the treasures he had collected, he caused them to be engraved, and gave a learned description of them in a work which he embellished with 800 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> plates.\n\nThe strength of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> seemed to give him hopes of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> life; but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> settling in one of his legs, which entirely destroyed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, he expired on the 5th of September 1765, and by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> is extinct. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a> erected to the honour of Count Caylus is to be seen in the chapel of St Germain l'Auxerrois, and deserves to be remarked. It is perfectly the tomb of an antiquary. This monument was an ancient sepulchral antique, of the most beautiful porphyry, with ornaments in the Egyptian taste.

He said frequently to his friends, \"I have this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> lost a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>; but I was sorry that I had not an opportunity of giving a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>.

He was born in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of his grandfather, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> Cecil, Esq., at Bourn in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLNSHIRE\">Lincolnshire</a>, in the year 1520; and received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a> school at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANTHAM\">Grantham</a>. From thence he was removed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAMFORD\">Stamford</a>; and about the year 1535, was entered of St John's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>. Here he began his studies with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of enthusiastic application very uncommon in young gentlemen of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 16 he read a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> lecture, and at 19 a voluntary Greek lecture, which was the more extraordinary as being at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> when the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> was by no means universally understood. In 1541 he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, and became a member of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of Gray's Inn, with an intention to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>; but he had not been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> in that situation before an accident introduced him to King Henry, and gave a new bias to his pursuits. O'Neil, a famous Irish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a>, coming to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, had brought with him two Irish chaplains, violent bigots to the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>; with these Mr Cecil, visiting his father, happened to have a warm dispute in Latin, in which he displayed uncommon abilities. The king, being informed of it, ordered the young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> into his presence, and was so pleased with his conversation, that he commanded his father to find a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> for him. He accordingly requested the reverence of the *cujus brevium*, which Mr Cecil afterwards persisted. About this time he married the sister of Sir John Cheke, by whom he was recommended to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol10.html#article-HERTFORD\">Hertford</a>, afterwards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Somerset and protector.\n\nSoon after King Edward's accession, Mr Cecil came into the possession of the office of *cujus brevium*, worth about \u00a3400 a-year. His first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> dying in 1543, he married the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Sir Anthony Cook, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a> of the king's studies. In 1547, he was appointed by the protector, master of requests; and soon after attended his noble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> on his expedition against the Scots, and was present at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MUSSELBURGH\">Musselburgh</a>. In this battle, which was fought on the 10th of September 1547, Mr Cecil's life was miraculously preserved by a friend, who on pushing him out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of a cannon, had his arm shattered to pieces. The fight and judgment of his friend must have been as extraordinary as his friendship, to perceive the precise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of a cannon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a>; unless we suppose, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> was almost quite spent; in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the thing is not impossible. The story is told in his life by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a>. In the year 1548, Mr Cecil was made secretary of state; but in the following year, the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHUMBERLAND\">Northumberland</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a> prevailing, he suffered in the disgrace of the protector Somerset, and was sent prisoner to the tower. After three months confinement he was released; in 1551 restored to his office; and soon after knighted, and sworn of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-PRIVY_COUNCIL\">privy <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>. In 1553 he was made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> of the order of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARTER\">Garter</a>, with an annual fee of 100 marks.\n\nOn the death of Edward VI. Mr Cecil prudently refused to have any concern in Northumberland's attempt in favour of the unfortunate Lady Jane Gray; and when Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> acceded to the throne, he was graciously received at court; but not choosing to change his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, was dismissed from his employments. During this reign, he was twice elected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a> of the shire for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a>; and often spoke in the house of commons, with great freedom and firmness, in opposition to the ministry. Nevertheless, though a Protestant and a patriot (that is, a courtier out of place), he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> to steer through a very dangerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> without shipwreck.\n\nQueen Elizabeth's accession in the year 1558 immediately dispelled the cloud which had obscured his fortunes and ministerial capacity. During the horrid reign of her father, he had constantly corresponded with the princess Elizabeth. On the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of her accession, he presented her with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> containing twelve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> necessary for her immediate dispatch; and, in a few days after, was sworn of the privy council, and made secretary of state. His first advice to the queen was, to call a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>; and the first business he proposed after it was assembled, was the establishment of a national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of reformation was accordingly drawn up under his immediate inspection, and the legal establishment of the church of England was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>. Sir William Cecil's next important concern, was to restore the value of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>, which had in the preceding reigns been considerably debased. In 1561, he was appointed master of the wards; and, in 1571, created <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">baron</a> of Burleigh, as a reward for his services, particularly in having lately stifled a formidable rebellion in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>. The following year he was honoured with the garter, and raised to the office of lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> treasurer of England. From this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> we find him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMUM_MOBILE\">primum <a cla</a>ss=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOBILE\">mobile</a> of every material transaction during the glorious reign of Queen Elizabeth. Notwithstanding the temporary influence of other favourites, Lord Burleigh was, in fact, her prime minister, and the person on whom she chiefly confided in matters of real importance. Having filled the highest and most important offices of the state for 40 years, and guided the helm of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> during the most glorious period of English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, he departed this life on the 4th of August 1598, in the 78th year of his age. His body was removed to Stamford, and there deposited in the family vault, where a magnificent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a> was erected to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>.\u2014Notwithstanding his long enjoyment of such lucrative employments, he left only an estate of \u00a34000 per annum, \u00a311,000 in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, and effects worth about \u00a314,000. He lived, indeed, in a manner suitable to his high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and importance,\nportance. He had four places of residence, viz., his lodgings at court, his house in the Strand, his seat at Burleigh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARK\">Park</a> near Stamford, and his seat at Theobald's. The last of these was his favourite place of retirement, where he frequently entertained the queen at vast expense.\n\nLord Burleigh was doubtless a man of singular abilities and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, amiable in his private character, and one of the most able, upright, and indefatigable ministers ever recorded in the annals of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>.

That, notwithstanding she had been converted to Christianity, her parents married her to a young pagan nobleman named Valerianus; who going to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> to her on the wedding night, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> is, says the book, was given to understand by his spouse, that she was nightly visited by an angel, and that he must forbear to approach her, otherwise the angel would destroy him. Valerianus, somewhat troubled at these words, desired that he might see his rival the angel; but his spouse told him that was impossible, unless he would consent to be baptized and become a Christian. This he consented to; after which, returning to his wife, he found her in her closet at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a>, and by her side, in the shape of a beautiful young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, an angel clothed with brightness.

Monks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> take a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOW\">vow</a> of celibate; and what is more, of chastity.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Rome imposes an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> celibacy on all its clergy, from the pope to the lowest deacon and subdeacon. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> for this usage pretend that a vow of perpetual celibacy was required in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> church as a condition of ordination, even from the earliest apostolic ages. But the contrary is evident from numerous examples of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> and archbishops, who lived in a state of matrimony, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> to their ordination or their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>. It is generally agreed that most of the apostles were married. Some say all of them, except St Paul and St John. Others say St Paul himself was married, because he writes to his yoke-fellow, whom they interpret his wife. Be this as it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, in the next ages after the apostles, we have accounts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> married bishops, presbyters, and deacons, without any reproach or mark of dishonour set on them; e.g., <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VALENS\">Valens</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESBYTER\">presbyter</a> of Philippi, mentioned by Polycarp; and Cheremon, bishop of Nitus. Novatus was a married presbyter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a>, as we learn from Cyprian; who himself was also a married <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, as Pagri confesses; and so was C\u00e6cilius the presbyter who converted him; and Numidius, another presbyter of Carthage. The reply which the Romanists give to this is, that all married persons, when they came to be ordained, promised to live separate from their wives by consent, which answered the vow of celibacy in other persons. But this is not only said without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, but against it. For Novatus presbyter of Carthage was certainly allowed to cohabit with his wife after ordination; as appears from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> that Cyprian brings against him, that he had struck and abused his wife, and thereby caused her to miscarry. There seems indeed to have been, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, a tendency towards the introduction of such a law by one or two zealots; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> sooner made than it was quashed by the authority of wiser men. Thus Eusebius observes, that Pinytus, bishop of Gnoffus in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRETE\">Crete</a>, was for laying the law of celibacy upon his brethren; but Dionysius bishop of Corinth wrote to him, that he should consider the weakness of men, and not impose that heavy burden on them. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of Nice, anno 325, the motion was renewed for a law to oblige the clergy to abstain from all conjugal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> with their wives, whom they had married before their ordination; but Paphnutius, a famous Egyptian bishop, and one who himself never was married, vigorously declaimed against it, upon which it was unanimously rejected. So <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a> and Sozomen tell the story; to which all that Valesius, after Bellarmine, has to say, is, that he supports the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of it. The council in Trullo, held in 692, made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in this respect between bishops and presbyters; allowing presbyters, deacons, and all the inferior orders, to cohabit with their wives after ordination; and giving the Roman church a smart rebuke for the contrary prohibition, but at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> laying an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INJUNCTION\">injunction</a> upon bishops to live separate from their wives, and appointing the wives to betake themselves to a monastic life, or become deaconesses in the church. And thus was a total celibate established in the Greek church as to bishops, but not\nIn the Latin church, the like establishment was also made, but by slow steps in many places. For in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, even bishops themselves cohabited with their wives at the time of the council of Trullo. The celibacy of the clergy, however, appears of an ancient standing, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not of command and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>; yet as of counsel and choice. But as it is clearly neither of divine nor apostolical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a>, it is at first hard to conceive from what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of Rome persisted so very obstinately to impose this institution on the clergy.\n\nBut we are to observe that this was a leading step to the execution of the project formed of making the clergy independent of princes, and rendering them a separate body to be governed by their own laws. In effect, while priests had children, it was very difficult to prevent their dependence on princes, whose favours have such an influence on private men; but having no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, they were more at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to adhere to the pope.","sp":315,"ep":316},{"h":"CELIDOGRAPHIA","t":"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the spots which appear on the surfaces of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>.

But after they had adopted the idolatrous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> and other nations, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOTHEOSIS\">apotheosis</a> of their heroes and princes, they came to worship them much in the same manner; as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> under the name of Taran, which in the Celtic signifies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a>, whom some authors call Heus or Hefus, probably from the Celtic baubh, which signifies a dog, and might be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANUBIS\">Anubis</a> latrans.\nCelts, latrants of the Egyptians. But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a> was held in the greatest veneration by the warlike, and Mercury by the trading, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the nation. The care of religion was immediately under the curates, since known by the name of druids and bards. These were, as Caesar tells us, the performers of sacrifices and all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> rites, and expounders of religion to the people. They also instructed youth in all kinds of learning, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, astrology, &c. Their doctrines were taught only by word of mouth, esteeming them too sacred to be committed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>.\u2014Other more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> subjects, such as their hymns to their gods, the exploits of princes and generals in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, and especially before a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, were couched in elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>, and recited, or rather sung, on all proper occasions; though even these were also kept from vulgar eyes, and either committed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, or, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> to writing, the whole was a secret to all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAITY\">laity</a>. The latter indeed seems the most probable, if what Caesar hints be true; namely, that those poetic records were increased in his time to such a bulk, that it took up a young bard near 20 years to learn them by heart. Diodorus tells us farther, that these poets used to accompany their songs with instrumental music, such as those of organs, harps, and the like; and that they were held in such veneration, that if in the time of an engagement between two armies, one of these bards appeared, both sides immediately ceased fighting. The reason of this was, that they were universally believed to be prophets as well as poets; so that it was thought dangerous as well as injurious to disobey what they supposed came from their gods. These prophetic philosophers kept <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">academies</a>, which were reported to not only by a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of their own youth, but also of those from other countries, insomuch that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> says, their philosophy passed from thence into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, and not from Greece thither. Diodorus likewise quotes a passage from Hecateus, which is greatly in their praise; viz. that the druids had some kind of instruments by which they could draw distant objects nearer, and make them appear larger and plainer; and by which they could discover even seas, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, and valleys, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>. But whatever might be their learning, it is certain, that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time they adopted several very barbarous customs, such as sacrificing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> victims to their gods, as more acceptable to them than those of any other animals. And Diodorus tells us of another inhuman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> they used in their divinations especially in great matters, which was done by killing some of their slaves, or some prisoners of war, if any they had, with a scimitar, to draw the augury from the running of his blood from his mangled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>.\n\nFor the history, &c. of the different Celtic nations see the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a>, &c.\n\nCeltic, certain ancient instruments of a wedge-like form, of which several have been discovered in different parts of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. Antiquarians have generally attributed them to the Celts; but not agreeing as to their use, distinguished them by the above unmeaning appellation. But Mr Whittaker makes it probable that they were British battle-axes. See Battle-Axe.\n\nCeltiberia, in Ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> of the Hither Spain, along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> or south-west side of the river Iberus; though sometimes the greatest part of Spain was called by the name Celtiberia. The people were denominated Celtiberi, or the Celte seated on the Iberus. They were very brave and warlike; their cavalry in particular was excellent. They wore a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> and rough cloak, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a> of which was like goats <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>. Some of them had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> bucklers like the Gauls: others hollow and round ones like those of other nations. They all wore boots made of hair, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> helmets adorned with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CRESTS\">crests</a> of a purple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. They used swords which cut on both sides, and poniards of a foot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>. Their arms were of an admirable temper, and are said to have been prepared in the following manner: they buried plates of iron underground, where they let them remain till the rust had eaten the weakest part of the metal, and the rest was consequently hard and firm. Of this excellent iron they made their swords, which were so strong and well tempered, that there was neither buckler nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELMET\">helmet</a> that could resist their edge. The Celtiberians were very cruel towards their enemies and malefactors, but showed the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> to their guests. They not only cheerfully granted their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a> to strangers, who travelled in their country, but were desirous that they should seek protection under their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a>.\n\nCeltis.

For this purpose the juice of garlic is recommended as exceedingly proper, being both very strong, and, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the operation is performed with care, leaving little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> mark.

Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEWIS\">Lewis</a> recommends a mixture of quicklime and cheese in the following manner: \"Sweet cheese shaved thin, and stirred with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, changes into a tenacious slime which does not mingle with the water.

When thoroughly dry, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be in two or three days, it is not in the least acted upon by water. Cheese barely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> with quicklime, as directed by some of the chemists for fusing cracked glasses, is not near so efficacious.\" A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of the drying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> of linseed and white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> is also used for the same purposes, but is greatly inferior.\n\nCement, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, is used to denote any kind of mortar of a stronger kind than ordinary. The cement <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> used is of two kinds; hot and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>. The hot cement is made of rosin, bees wax, brick dust, and chalk boiled together. The bricks to be cemented are heated, and rubbed one upon another, with cement between them. The cold cement is that above described for cementing china, &c. which is sometimes, though rarely, employed in building.\n\nThe ruins of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Roman buildings are found to cohere so strongly, that most people have imagined the\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> were acquainted with some kind of mortar, which, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of ours, might justly be called cement; and that to our want of knowledge of the materials they used, is owing the great inferiority of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> buildings in their durability. In 1770, one M. Loriot, a Frenchman, pretended to have discovered the secret of the ancient cement, which, according to him, was no more than a mixture of powdered quicklime with lime which had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> flaked and kept under water. The flaked lime was first to be made up with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, brickdust, &c., into mortar after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> method, and then about a third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of quicklime in powder was added to the mixture. This produced an almost instantaneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETRIFICATION\">petrification</a>, something like what is called the setting of alabastron, but in a much stronger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>; and was possessed of many wonderful qualities needless here to relate, seeing it has never been known to succeed with any other person who tried it. Mr Anderson, in his essays on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, has discussed this subject at considerable length, and seemingly with great judgment. He is the only person we know who has given any rational <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of the uses of lime in building, and why it comes to be the proper basis of all cements. His account is in substance as follows:\n\nLime which has been flaked and mixed with sand, becomes hard and congealed when dry, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> similar to that which produces the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STALACTITES\">stalactites</a> in caverns. These are always formed by water dripping from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a>. By some unknown and inexplicable process of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, this water has dissolved in it a small portion of calcareous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> in a caustic state. As long as the water continues covered from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, it keeps the earth dissolved in it; it being the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of calcareous earths, when deprived of their fixed air, to dissolve in water. But when the small drop of water comes to be exposed to the air, the calcareous matter contained in it begins to attract the fixable part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. In proportion as it does so, it also begins to separate from the water, and to reunite its native form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a> or marble. This process Mr Anderson calls a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a>; and when the calcareous matter is perfectly crystallized in this manner, he affirms, that it is to all intents and purposes limestone or marble of the same consistence as before; and \"in this manner (says he), within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, have huge rocks of marble been formed near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATLOCK\">Matlock</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DERBYSHIRE\">Derbyshire</a>.\" If lime in a caustic state is mixed with water, part of the lime will be dissolved, and will also begin to crystallize. The water which parted with the crystallized lime will then begin to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> upon the remainder, which it could not dissolve before; and thus the process will continue, either till the lime be all reduced to an effete, or (as he calls it) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLINE\">crystalline</a> state, or something hinders the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the water upon it. It is this crystallization which is observed by the workmen when a heap of lime is mixed with water, and left for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to macerate. A hard crust is formed upon the surface, which is ignorantly called frothing, though it takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> as well as in winter. If therefore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> of the lime, or its becoming a cement, depends entirely on the formation of its crystals, it is evident that the perfection of the cement must depend on the perfection of the crystals, and the hardness of the matters which are entangled among them. The additional substances used in making of mortar, such as sand, brickdust, or the like, according to Mr Anderson, serve only for a purpose similar to what is answered by sticks put into a vessel full of any saline solution, namely, to afford the crystals an opportunity of fastening themselves upon it. If therefore the matter interposed between the crystals of the lime is of a friable, brittle nature, such as brickdust or chalk, the mortar will be of a weak and imperfect kind; but, when the particles are hard, angular, and very difficult to be broken, such as those of river or pit sand, the mortar turns out exceedingly good and strong. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">Sea</a> sand is found to be an improper material for mortar, which Mr Anderson attributes to its being less angular than the other kinds. That the crystallization may be the more perfect, he also recommends a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> quantity of water, that the ingredients be perfectly mixed together, and that the drying be as slow as possible. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to these circumstances, he thinks, would make the buildings of the moderns equally durable with those of the ancients; and from what remains of the ancient Roman works, he thinks a very strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> might be adduced.\n\nThe great thickness of their walls necessarily required a vast length of time to dry. The middle of them was composed of pebbles thrown in at random, and which have evidently had mortar so thin as to be poured in among them. By this means a great quantity of the lime would be dissolved, and the crystallization performed in the most perfect manner; and the indefatigable pains and perseverance for which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> were so remarkable in all their undertakings, leave no room to doubt that they would take care to have the ingredients mixed together as well as possible. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of all this is, that the buildings formed in this manner are all as firm as if cut out of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> rock; the mortar being equally hard, if not more so, than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> themselves.\n\nNotwithstanding the bad success of those who have attempted to repeat M. Loriot's experiments, however, Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> informs us, that a cement of this kind is certainly practicable. It is done, he says, by powdering the lime while hot from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KILN\">kiln</a>, and throwing it into a thin paste of sand and water; which, not flaking immediately, absorbs the water from the mortar by degrees, and forms a very hard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>. \"It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>,\" he adds, \"that the strength of this mortar depends on using the lime hot or fresh from the kiln.\"\n\nBy mixing together gypsum and quicklime, and then adding water, we may form a cement of tolerable hardness, and which apparently might be used to advantage in making troughs for holding water, or lining small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> for it to run in. Mr Wiegley says, that a good mortar or cement, which will not crack, may be obtained by mixing three parts of a thin magma of flaked lime with one of powdered gypsum; but adds, that it is used only in a dry situation. A mixture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARRAS\">tarras</a> with flaking lime acquires in time a stony hardness, and may be used for preventing water from entering. See Mortar and Stucco.\n\nCement, among engravers, jewellers, &c., is the same with the hot cement used in building; and is used for keeping the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> to be engraved firm to the foregoing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a>, and also for filling up what is to be chiselled. Article.\n\nCement, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a>, is used to signify all those powders\nCement powders and pastes with which any body is surrounded in pots or crucibles, and which are capable by the help of fire of producing changes upon that body. They are made of various materials; and are used for different purposes, as for parting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> from silver, converting it into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>; and by cementation more considerable changes can be effected upon bodies, than by applying to them liquids of any kind; because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> matters are then in a state of vapour, and assisted by a very considerable degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>.\n\n**Cement which quickly hardens in water.** This is described in the posthumous works of Mr Hooke, and is recommended for gilding live craw fish, carps, &c., without injuring the fish. The cement for this purpose is prepared, by putting some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURGUNDY\">Burgundy</a> pitch into a new earthen pot, and warming the vessel till it receives so much of the pitch as will stick round it, then strewing some finely-powdered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a> over the pitch when growing cold, adding a mixture of three pounds of linseed oil, and one of oil of turpentine, covering the vessel and boiling them for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> over a gentle fire, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> the mixture as it is wanted with as much pumice stone in fine powder as will reduce it to the consistence of paint. The fish being wiped dry, the mixture is spread upon it; and the gold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> being then laid on, the fish may be immediately put into water again, without any danger of the gold coming off, for the matter quickly grows hard in the water.\n\n**Cement Pots,** are those earthen pots used in the cementation of metals.\n\n**CEMENTATION,** the act of corroding or otherwise changing a metal by means of a Cement.\n\n**Cemetery** (Koimatarion, from Koimai, to \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>\"), a place set apart or consecrated for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURIAL\">burial</a> of the dead.\n\nAnciently none were buried in churches or churchyards: it was even unlawful to inter in cities, and the cemeteries were without the walls. Among the primitive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> these were held in great veneration. It even appears from Eusebius and Tertullian, that, in the early ages, they assembled for divine worship in the cemeteries. Valerian seems to have confiscated the cemeteries and other places of divine worship, but they were restored again by Gallienus. As the martyrs were buried in these places, the Christians chose them for building churches on, when Constantine established their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>; and hence some derive the rule which still obtains in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Rome, never to consecrate an altar without putting under it the relics of some saint. The practice of consecrating cemeteries is of some antiquity. The bishop walked round it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESSION\">procession</a>, with the crozier or pastoral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the holy water pot being carried before, out of which the absolutions were made.\n\n**Cenchrus.** See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">Botany</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>.\n\n**Cenegild,** in the Saxon antiquities, an expiatory mulct, paid by one who had killed a man to the kindred of the deceased. The word is compounded of the Saxon cinne, i.e. cognatio, \"relation,\" and gild, solutio, \"payment.\"\n\n**Cenobite.** See Cornobite.\n\n**Cenotaph,** in antiquity, an empty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a>, erected by way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to the deceased. It is distinguished from a sepulchre, in which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COFFIN\">coffin</a> was deposited. Of these there were two sorts; one for those who had, and another for those who had not, been honoured with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNERAL_RITES\">funeral <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> in another place.\n\nThe sign whereby honorary sepulchres were distinguished from others, was commonly the wreck of a ship, to denote the decease of the person in some foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>.\n\n**Censer,** in antiquity, a vase containing incense to be used in sacrifices. Censer is chiefly used in speaking of the Jewish worship. Among the Greeks and Romans it is more frequently called thuribulum, \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACERRA\">acerra</a>.\n\nThe Jewish censer was a small sort of chafing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISH\">dish</a>, covered with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOME\">dome</a>, and suspended by a chain. Josephus tells us, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a> made 20,000 gold censers for the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, to offer perfumes in, and 50,000 others to carry fire in.\n\n**Censio,** in antiquity, the act or office of the censor. See Census.\n\nCenso included both the rating or valuing a man's estate, and the imposing mulcts and penalties.\n\n**Censio hastaria,** a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> inflicted on a Roman soldier for some offence, as laziness or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a>, whereby his bafta or spear was taken from him, and consequently his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> and hopes of preferment stopped.\n\n**Censitus,** a person censied, or entered in the censual tables. See Census.\n\nIn an ancient monument found at Ancyra containing the actions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Octavius, we read,\n\n*Quo lustro civium Romanorum\nCensita sunt capitae quadragies\nCentum milia et sexaginta tria.*\n\nCensitus is also used in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CIVIL_LAW\">civil <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> for a servile sort of tenant, who pays capitation to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> for the lands he holds of him, and is entered as such in the lord's rent roll. In which sense, the word amounts to the same with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPITE\">capite</a> census, or capite censitus. See Capite Censi.\n\n**Censor,** (from cenere to \"think\" or \"judge\"), one of the prime magistrates in ancient Rome.\u2014Their business was to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> the effects of the Roman citizens, to impose taxes in proportion to what each man possessed, and to take cognizance or inspection of the manners of the citizens. In consequence of this last part of their office, they had a power to censure vice or immorality, by inflicting some public mark of ignominy on the offender. They had even a power to create the princeps senatus, and to expel from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> such as they deemed unworthy of that office. This power they sometimes exercised without sufficient grounds; and therefore a law was at length passed, that no senator should be degraded or disgraced in any manner, until he had been formally accused and found guilty by both the censors. It was also a part of the censorian jurisdiction, to fill up the vacancies in the senate, upon any remarkable deficiency in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>; to let out to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> all the lands, revenues, and customs, of the republic; and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> with officers for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of building and repairing all the public works and edifices both in Rome and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>. In all parts of their office, however,\nthey were subject to the jurisdiction of the people; and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> always lay from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> of the censors to that of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> of the people.\n\nThe first two censors were created in the year of Rome 311, upon the senate's observing that the consuls were too much taken up with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> as not to have time to look into other matters. The office <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to the time of the emperors, who assumed the censorial power, calling themselves *morum prefecti*; though Vespasian and his sons took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of censors. Decius attempted to restore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> to a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>. After this we hear no more of it, till Constantine's time, who made his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> censor, and he seems to have been the last that enjoyed the office.\n\nThe office of censor was so considerable, that for a long time none aspired to it till they had palled all the rest; so that it was thought surprising that Crassus should be admitted censor, without having been either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a> or praetor. At first the censors enjoyed their dignity for five years, but in 420 the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DICTATOR\">dictator</a> Mamercus made a law restraining it to a year and a half, which was afterwards observed very strictly. At first one of the censors was elected out of a patrician, and the other out of a plebeian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>; and upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of either, the other was discharged from his office, and two new ones elected, but not till the next lustrum. In the year of Rome 622, both censors were chosen from among the plebeians; and after that time the office was shared between the senate and people.\u2014After their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMITIA\">Comitia</a> Centuriata, the censors proceeded to the capitol, where they took an oath not to manage either by favour or disaffection, but to act equitably and impartially throughout the whole course of their administration.\n\nThe republic of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> still has a censor of the manners of their people, whose office lasts six months.\n\n*Censors of Books,* are a body of doctors or others established in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> countries to examine all books before they go to the press, and to see they contain nothing contrary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> and good manners.\n\nAt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, before the late revolution, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a> claimed this privilege as granted to them by the pope; but, in 1624, new commissions of four doctors were created, by letters patent, the sole censors of all books, and answerable for every thing contained therein.\n\nIn England, we had formerly an officer of this kind, under the title of licensor of the press; but, since the Revolution, our press has been laid under no such restraint.\n\n*Censorinus,* a celebrated writer in the third century, well known by his treatise *De Die Natali.* This treatise, which was written about the year 238, Gerard Voisius calls a little book of gold; and declares it to be a most learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> and importance to chronologers, since it connects and determines, with great exactness, some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> eras in pagan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>. It was printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, with the notes of Lindenbrokius, in 1695.\n\n*Censure,* a judgment which condemns some book, person, or action, or more particularly, a reprimand from a superior. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">Ecclesiastical</a> censures are penalties, by which, for some remarkable misbehaviour, Christians are deprived of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a> of the church, or prohibited to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> the sacerdotal office.\n\n**Census,** in Roman antiquity, an authentic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> made before the censors, by the several subjects of the empire, of their respective names and places of abode. This declaration was registered by the censors; and contained an enumeration, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, of all the estates, lands, and inheritances they possessed; their quantity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, place, wives, children, domestics, tenants, slaves. In the provinces the census served not only to discover the subsistence of each person, but where, and in what manner and proportion, taxes might be best imposed. The census at Rome is commonly thought to have been held every five years; but Dr Middleton hath shown, that both census and lustrum were held irregularly and uncertainly at various intervals. The census was an excellent expedient for discovering the strength of the state; for by it they discovered the number of the citizens, how many were fit for war, and how many for offices of other kinds; how much each was able to pay of taxes, &c. It went through all ranks of people, though under different names: that of the common people was called *census*; that of the knights, *census, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RECENSIO\">recensio</a>, recognitio*; that of the senators, *lection, relectio.*\u2014Hence also *census* came to signify a person who had made such a declaration; in which sense it was opposed to *incensus,* a person who had not given in his estate or name to be registered.\n\nThe census, according to Salmasius, was peculiar to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Rome. That in the provinces was properly called *professio* and *annua.* But this distinction is not everywhere observed by the ancients themselves.\n\n*Census* was also used for the book or register wherein the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a> of the people were entered: In which sense, the census was frequently cited and appealed to as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> in the courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>.\n\n*Census* is also used to denote a man's whole substance or estate.\n\n*Census Senatorius,* the patrimony of a senator, which was limited to a certain value; being at first rated at 800,000 sesterces, but afterwards, under Augustus, enlarged to 1,200,000.\n\n*Census Eques,* the estate or patrimony of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a>, rated at 400,000 sesterces, which was required to qualify a person for that order, and without which no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> or merit was available.\n\n*Census* was also used for a person worth 100,000 sesterces, or who was entered as such in the census tables, on his own declaration. In which sense, census amounts to the same with *clasticus,* or a man of the first class; though Gellius limits the estate of those of this class to 125,000 asses. By the Viconian law, no census was allowed to give his will above a fourth part of what he was worth to a woman.\n\n*Census* was also used to denote a tax or tribute imposed on persons, and called also capitation. See *Capite Censi.*\n\n*Census Dominicatus,* in writers of the lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, denotes a rent due to the lord.\n\n*Census Duplicitus,* a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> rent or tax, paid by vassals to their lord on extraordinary or urgent occasions; as expeditions to the Holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">Land</a>, &c.\n\n*Census Ecclesia Romana,* was an annual contribution voluntarily paid to the see of Rome by the several princes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.","sp":318,"ep":321},{"h":"CENT","t":"signifies properly a hundred, being an abridgement of the word centum; but is often used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> to express the profit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> loss arising from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of any commodity: so that when we say there is 10 per cent. profit, or 10 per cent. loss, upon any merchandise that has been sold, it is to be understood that the seller has either gained or lost 10l. on every 10l. of the price at which he bought that merchandise; which is \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of profit, or \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of loss, upon the total of the sale.","sp":321,"ep":322},{"h":"CENTAUR","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> moiety of a southern constellation, in form half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>; usually joined with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLF\">wolf</a>.

When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAN\">span</a> is small, and upon a limited scale, as cellars, and vaults below ground, the foundation of the side-walls is dug out, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> rounded off betwixt, the arch thrown over upon it, and the earth is afterwards dug out and carried away. This must have been done on any account. By this method the wood and workmanship are saved; but it is only in particular instances that this can be done.

The whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> is brought <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, and the saving on the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> produces a more serious loss on the other, so that both the workmen and proprietors agree, that it is better that the centre be too strong than too weak; better have too much wood in it than too little.\nTo assist the mechanic in this important affair, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of treating this article with particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>; for which purpose we shall be at pains to acquire every affiance that can be collected, from the most experienced engineers, and from the researches and experiments of the most distinguished philosophers who have treated of such arts as may enable us to elucidate the subject, and make it worth the attention of engineers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a> who may have occasion to exert their genius in that line.\n\nIn the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be necessary to consider the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> to be supported; 2dly, The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of the materials to be used, that shall be of strength sufficient to support such a weight; 3dly, The most effective method to apply these materials, as supported by the most approved authorities, or practised by the ablest engineers. The weight to be supported is the arch-stones. Suppose an arch of 20 feet span, (see figures for the arches, a new figure being unnecessary.) It has been shown under the article Bridges, that the arch can be raised to 30 degrees and upwards, without the support of the center; after which it begins to rest upon the frame of which the center is composed, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the arch is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a>, or femielliptic; if a segment of a circle, it will press sooner upon the centre, and the more so the flatter the arch is. 1st, Suppose a semicircle; then there is 120 degrees of the arch, to be supported by the center, the diameter supposed is 20 feet. One hundred and twenty degrees will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> 20.94393 feet; but as it is advisable to give the advantage to the centre, we call it 21 feet in an arch of 20 feet span. If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> is of a durable and hard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, perhaps an arch-stone of 12 or 14 inches might be of sufficient strength; yet it is not probable that any one would think of less than 18 inches for the thickness of the arch; for it will not have too heavy an appearance if it should be two feet thick. We shall calculate the weight at 18 inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>; the thickness of the stone is not here to be considered, as the weight of the whole is to be supported till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEY\">key</a>-stone is driven: the specific gravity of good freestone is 2.532, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> feet in an arch of 120 degrees; the span 20 feet is 21 feet, nearly as above. The stone 18 inches square by 21 feet, gives 47.25 solid feet; the weight by the above specific gravity is 74.77.3076 lb. averdupoise, about 66.753 cwt. being the weight that one rib of the center frame must sustain, without warping, or by the pressure on its branches make it rise in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>; neither must it sink under the pressure: in either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the consequences would be fatal, either in causing the arch to give way, upon striking out the center, or in weakening it in such a manner as to shorten its durability; being twisted in its shape, the equilibrium would be destroyed, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> would be either to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> the key-stone, or, if that was prevented by the weight above it, the same weight would cause it yield at about, or a little above, 30 degrees from the spring of the arch. From all which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of the strength and firmness of the center frame is evident.\n\nIf the arch exceeds 20 feet, suppose 50, the weight will evidently become greater, and an additional strength necessary on that account; and likewise on account of its greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, the frame that would be sufficiently firm at 20 feet, would be supple at 50. To prevent any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> on this account, another calculation for 50 feet will become necessary. In the span of 50 the arch of 120 degrees <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> 52.56 feet; suppose the arch-stone 2\u00bd feet deep by 2, is five superficial feet, multiplied by 52.56 is 261.8 solid feet, and at the above specific gravity gives 41429.7154748 lb. averdupoise, equal to 369.908 cwt. Here the weight is increased upon the center frame, in the proportion of 66.5 to 369.9, that is, more than five times, besides what allowance will be necessary to make, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of the stiffness of the center frame; both which will be considered in their proper places.\n\nLet us now consider what will be the increase of weight upon a span of 100 feet. The rise of the arch, before it presses on the center-frame in a semicircle, being in the same proportion; the arch of 120 degrees in a 100 feet span, measures 104.719 feet; the arch-stone may be supposed abundantly strong of 4 feet length, for the depth of the arch, and 3 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, which makes a superficies of 12 feet, and multiplied by 104.719 gives 1256.628 solid feet, the specific gravity, that is, the stone is supposed of the same durability gives 193,861.381 lb. averdupoise, equal to 1775.543 cwt. about five times more weight than upon the arch of 50 feet span. If the arch is 150 feet span; 120 degrees measure 136.13556 feet. Suppose the arch-stone 5 feet, as in the arch-stones of the bridge over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEE\">Dee</a> at Aberdeen, at least they are between 4\u00bd and 5 feet. The Aberdeen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a> is a very hard stone, and perhaps exceeds the specific gravity above. The arch-stone is here supposed to be 5 feet by 3, equal to 15 square feet, multiplied by 136.13556, gives 2042.0334 solid feet. According to the above specific gravity, the weight to be supported till the key-stone is drove, is 2885.2838 cwt. The weight of the key-stone in the whole of the above may be deducted.\n\nAs center frames must likewise be used for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> bridges, we shall consider them, and take the span 236 feet, still supporting a semicircle.\n\nIt may be proper to take the weight that it would be if the arch were the segment of a circle, the span of the arch 236, the height above the spring of the arch, or the verified line of the arch, 34 feet, in which case the diameter of the circle would be 444 feet nearly; the arch-stones in this segment would press upon the center-frame, at about 18 feet from the spring of the arch. Suppose the arch-stone 5 feet by 4, equal to 20 superficial feet, the whole measure of the arch is 444.154 linear feet, the solid content is 4131.81 feet, and weight 318.659 tons; but the weight of the iron was only 260 tons. It may not be improper here to observe, that in a stone bridge of that span, 5 feet of arch-stone would be too small to sustain the arch. It may perhaps be admitted, that it would be sufficient to support its own weight; and if so, the arch being smoothed above, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> arch of a five-feet stone may be thrown over above it. These two together may form a stronger arch than a stone of ten feet depth would do. And thus a stone arch may be extended to any span, and made of abundant strength; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> has shown its durability to withstand the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. Thus the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> bridge has performed its faithful services to the public for 600 years: that it was an incumbrance in passing up and down\nthe river, and clumsy in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, were owing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> of the times; perhaps few will be found that would be willing to infuse an iron bridge against the ruin occasioned by the weather, for the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, or perhaps much above one-half that time. But this is not a fit place to enter into the full discussion of this subject. To return to the weight pressing upon a center-frame. Having now taken a view of the weight to be supported, it comes next to be considered what strength of wood is necessary to resist this force; and the most proper and commodious manner of combining the parts. To determine this, we must have recourse to such experiments as have been made for trying the strength of different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of stone and wood.\n\nExperiments have been made to ascertain the strength of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>, and many of them appear to have been conducted with great care and attention. Some of these the reader will find collected and detailed under the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRENGTH_OF_MATERIALS\">Strength of Materials</a>. We shall here state the result of some of the curious experiments which were instituted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> de Buffon to ascertain this point. According to these experiments, the batten of five inches square, whose length was 14 feet, and which supported a weight of 5300 lb., may be called its breaking force, should have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> the strength of a batten of 28 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>. But it has a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> more. The latter by the experiment is equal to 1775 only; whereas the half of 5300 is 2650. But it is to be considered, that the power of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a> is in proportion to its distance from the fulcrum; this power arising from the weight of the log, is the weight of one foot of wood, acting as a weight at a distance from the fulcrum. The log increases in its power to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> by its length: 12 inches of this log, five inches square, weighs about 10.4 lb.; somewhat more or less; and 10.4 lb. at 13 feet distance, acts with a force of 135.2 lb.: this we consider the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a>; and, at the point of fracture, is the first term: the first and last term, multiplied by half the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of terms, are equal to the sum of all the terms; that is, $135.2 \\times 6\\frac{1}{2}$, amount 878.8 lb. added to 1775, equal 2653.8; so near to the half, that the difference may easily be accounted for, from the real weight of the wood, on which the experiment was made; and our taking the weight from tables of specific gravity, or the supposed 62 lb. To take another example, a batten of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> feet is double the strength of one of the same size, of 18 feet long. The weight that breaks a batten of nine feet, five inches square, is 8308 lb.; the half is 4154, but by the experiment, 3700 lb., break the batten at 18 feet. N.B. The weight being laid upon the middle, 9\u00bd is the number of terms, one-half is 4.625. Seventeen feet one-half is 8\u00bd; 10.4 lb. multiplied by 8\u00bd, is 102 \u00d7 4.625, half the number of terms, is $\\frac{471.25 + 3700}{2} = 4171.25$, somewhat greater, but which is so near, that the smallest accident for failure, not discernible in the wood, will occasion the difference. Now to reduce the experiment of this given size, to any other of greater dimensions; suppose one foot similar solids of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a>, are to one another as their bases, that is 25; the base of the five inch square, is 144; the base of the 12 inch square; as the weight that would break the batten of nine feet, to the weight that will break another of the same nine feet length, and of one foot square (5.6 El. 12), that is, as the base 25 is to the weight 8308, so is 144 to 478.5 lb.; equal 213.8125 ton, and the proportion as above, for greater or less length of logs or spars. As we have no experiments made of logs of 12 inches square; unless there is something in the texture of the fibres, in pieces of different diameters, we have every reason to conclude, the above proportion will give the proper strength of the material used. It must, however, not be forgot, that the pieces upon which the experiments were made, were nicely chosen for the purpose. It will scarcely be practicable to find a piece of 12 inches square, and even of nine feet length, equally well adapted to bear a proportionable strain; and much more difficult to find a piece of still greater length. These experiments and proportions afford a safe criterion for proper limits to be attended to in practice. In this, we do not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> to apply such a load upon the beam as will break it; we intend the beam to support the load, without giving way or yielding to it.\n\nIn the same experiments, we are told by the author, that two-thirds of the weight broke the beam in the space of two months; that one-half the weight gave a set or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> which it did not recover, but showed no farther tendency to break; that one-third of the weight, after long continuance, did not give it a set; but the weight being removed, the beam returned to the same position as before it was loaded. Betwixt one-third, and the half of load or weight that would break the beam, is the strength we allot to it for permanent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. Before we proceed to put the above observations into full practice, let us examine whether the log is necessary to be square to give it the greatest strength: practice, in a great measure, determines that it is not. It is, however, necessary to inquire what breadth to a given depth is sufficient as a maximum that we ought not to exceed; or what is the minimum that we may use, so as not to lose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> intended effect. Belidor, has made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of experiments on the transverse strength of bodies which are detailed in his Science des Ingenieurs, but the spars are only of one inch, not exceeding two inches in breadth or thickness. Among these, we select one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAR\">spar</a> two inches breadth, one inch depth, and 18 inches length; which at the medium of three trials, was broken, lying loose at both ends, by 80.5 lb. Another one inch broad, two inches deep, and 18 inches long, broke with the force of 158 lb.; nearly in the proportion of the square of the depth, being only a diminution of 20 lb. weight. In the present case, the quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> is the same in both.\n\nIt may therefore be concluded from this experiment, that a batten of any depth, and one-half breadth, is equally strong in that position, as if it had been square timber; and that the strength is according to the depth, if the breadth is only such as that it does not yield in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. And hence, the advantage in point of economy; for if the piece is set upon its edge, suppose nine inches deep and one broad, provided that by straining the piece in depth, it shall not yield in the lateral direction, it will bear as much strain as if nine inches square. The experiment may be performed upon a small scale. Suppose five inches, and one inch broad, the thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> may be enclosed at different distances with pieces five inches square. Suppose at the distances of 1, 2, 3, &c. fig. 1. Plate CXXXVIII. and the weight applied that broke the five inch square of the length of 14 feet, viz. 5300 lb. All\nAll the experiments which have been alluded to above were made upon scantlings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> oak. But it has already been observed, that in practice, such pieces cannot always, if at all, be selected. But the practical mechanic, confining himself to between one-third and one-half of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> strength, according as his judgment directs him, respecting the soundness of the piece he uses; there can be no doubt, that, upon occasions, he will be convinced, that he cannot, with safety, allow even one-third of the absolute strength, but must take it considerably below that proportion.\n\nAs to other species of wood, trials have also been made; and the result from different experiments has occasioned some deviation. We are told that Buffon makes fir about $\\frac{3}{5}$ths of the strength of oak; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">Parent</a> $\\frac{4}{5}$ths; and Emeron $\\frac{3}{4}$ds, all of them different. The difference between Buffon and Parent is $\\frac{1}{20}$th; between Parent and Emeron is $\\frac{1}{10}$th; and between Buffon and Emeron is $\\frac{1}{4}$th. It is easy to conceive, that the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of the wood, and different circumstances in the same species of fir and oak, will make a considerable difference; although the same persons were employed on the same materials, the experiments would probably vary; much more, may it be allowed that at different times different states of the wood must make the results different.\n\nThe experiments made by different persons vary in their amount. Belidor's experiments agree one part with another, and so do Buffon's, but differ in their results from Belidor's. Belidor's slips of oak are only of one inch square, and Buffon's are from four to eight inches square, and from 7 to 28 feet in length. When the one is reduced to the standard of the other, they do not agree: the difference may arise from various causes. We know that there is a difference in the strength of oak, of different growths, and from different soils, as well as in other species of wood; there is likewise a difference in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of seasoning of the wood. Buffon gives the weight of his wood, Belidor does not. If Buffon's log or batten, four inches square, weighs about 60lb. that is, about 77lb. the solid foot; whereas a solid foot of dry oak will not weigh above 60lb.; but Buffon acknowledges that his wood was in the sap, as vapours issued at both ends in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a>. These differences may make all the odds in the breaking, unless the proportion was established to be, as the squares of the diameter of the battens; but this is not the case, for in Buffon's Experiments, the square of four, to the square of five of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> feet batten, the breaking force is 8300lb.; but the experiment gives it 11525; that of six inches square $16:36:\\times 312:119:52$; esp. 18950. In the seven inch square $16:49:\\times 312:162:68$; esp. 32200. In the eight inch square $16:64:\\times 312:212:48$; esp. 47649, the difference between four and five inch square is one-third part of the experiment weight; the difference between the four and five, is somewhat more than one-third the experiment weight; and in the seventh, the difference is a little less than half the experiment weight; between the seventh and the eighth the difference is greater than half the experiment weight.\n\nThere is likewise a difference at the different lengths; for it does not appear that the different lengths bear a proportion to their parts; a batten of four inches square of seven feet length, is expected to be double the strength of one of the same dimensions of 14 feet length, that is, the one of 14 feet length, is expected to break with one half of the weight, that breaks the seven feet batten; but we find it much less; but when it is considered that the weight of the materials acting at a greater distance from the centre of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, this must be taken into the account, and added to the weight of the breaking force. For example, the batten of five inches square and 12 inches length, weighs 13:368lb. at the rate of 77lb. per solid foot. This weight, acting upon the batten of 14 feet, taking the amount of the whole in an arithmetical ratio, is $13:368\\times 52\\frac{1}{2} = 701:5$lb. acting upon the whole, added to 5300, the breaking force 6001. The breaking force, at seven feet, is 11525, one half is 5762:25 one twenty-fourth part greater than the half. The batten of six inches square, the breaking force at 14 feet is 7475, the weight of 12 inches of this batten is 19:25lb. at 77lb. per solid foot; the acting force of this weight at 14 feet length is $19:25\\times 52\\frac{1}{2} = 1010:625$, added to 7475, equal to 8485625. Now the breaking force of seven feet length, is 18050; one half is 9475, the difference is 989, that is, nine and a half times less than the half. In the seven inch batten of seven feet length, the breaking force is 32,200lb. and of 14 feet length, the breaking force is 13,225. The weight of 12 inches of the seven inch square is 26:21lb. acting upon the 14 feet length, is $1370:5 + 1322:5 = 1460:21$lb. which is one-ninth less than the half. Again, 12 inches of the eight inch batten, weighs 34:21lb. at 77lb. per solid foot, acting upon the 14 feet length, is 17961lb. added to 19775, the force that broke it at 14 feet length, is 21751lb. about one-tenth part less than the half of 47649lb. which broke it at seven feet length. From the above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>, it may be allowed, that the difference of the force that broke the spar at seven feet, and that which broke it at 14, so far as it differs from the half, is accounted for upon philosophical principles; and when we consider that the spars or batons cannot be supposed to be mathematically exact in their measure, and that a difference in point of breaking, may be accounted for from that cause; but further, it may be observed that the weight of the materials is not equal in the solid foot. For example, the spar four inches square, and seven feet in length, weighs 60lbs.; that is, at the rate of 77:14lb. per solid or cubic foot, the eight feet spar at the rate of 76:5lb do.; the nine feet spar at the rate of 77lb.; the ten feet spar at the rate of 75:6; the 12 feet spar at the rate of 75lb. per cubic foot; which difference of weight, with the difference of exact mathematical measure, may fully account for all the difference that takes place in the manner of accounting for the above-mentioned difference of the weights of breaking, at 7 and 14 feet; as also the difference that takes place between 8 and 16; 9 and 18, &c. the experiments being made upon green wood, cannot be approved of; they ought to have been made of such seasoned wood as is fitted for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> purposes, of which none of this kind can be used; or if experiments are made with unseasoned wood, as being of the greatest strength, they ought likewise to have been made with dry wood seasoned for use. A cubic foot of dry oak,\noak, will not weigh much above 60lb. Those spars upon which the experiments were made, must have been very green, and very unfit for mechanical purposes, which gives an unfair account of the strength, when in a proper state for use. But experiments were made with wood of different weights, which may be supposed better seasoned. For example, the seven feet spar that weighs 56lb. that is, 72lb. per cubic foot; the nine feet spar is at 71lb. per solid foot, and the ten feet spar at 73.8lb. per solid foot, none of which are seasoned wood. And yet it is not mentioned which of these were used. This may be adduced as a very good reason why the variations were so great.\n\nWe shall now consider the force in bruising materials, according as we may be directed by experiments made in this way. And it is upon that of stone, which will in some measure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to the pressure in the same direction upon other materials.\n\nThe experiments selected from M. Gauthey, engineer, in erecting the bridge of Chalons sur <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAONE\">Saone</a>, (tom iv. Rosier Journal de Physique, November 1774,) are now to be considered.\n\nExperiments Selected.\n\n| Length of the Stone | Breadth. | Superficies. | Force. | Upon each square line. | Proportion. | Difference |\n|--------------------|----------|--------------|--------|-----------------------|------------|------------|\n| Hard Stone         |          |              |        |                       |            |            |\n| 8                  | 8        | 64           | 46     | 10                    | 12         | 3          |\n| 8                  | 12       | 96           | 164    | 27                    | 24         | 3          |\n| 8                  | 16       | 128          | 281    | 35                    | 36         | 3          |\n| Soft Stone         |          |              |        |                       |            |            |\n| 9                  | 16       | 144.1        | 35     | 3                     | 4          | 1          |\n| 9                  | 18       | 162.1        | 53     | 5                     | 4\u00bd         | \u00bd          |\n| 18                 | 18       | 324.2        | 183    | 8\u00bd                    | 9          | 1          |\n| 18                 | 24       | 432.3        | 131    | 12\u00bd                   | 12         | 0          |\n\nIn general, the force is greater as the surfaces increase, but a regular proportion to fix upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> is not found; but the last line in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, the weight that crushes the 432.3 surface, must be greater than 131, the stone being of the same quality: if in the proportion of 8\u00bd to 12\u00bd, the crushing weight will be 272.7 instead of 131.\n\nThe measures here taken are cubic, and the pressing force is upon cubic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, the thickness one line; where the pressure is upon a square foot, it is likewise to be understood one foot deep, or upon a cubic foot; the stone he terms <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">Glory</a> stone, of which he gives its absolute force to be 870911, that it will bear 663552lb. In the cubic foot of soft stone the strength is 248832lb. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> force of the hard and soft is 2\u00bd to 1.\n\nA cubic foot of a stone fixed in a wall, and projecting one foot, was broken by a force of 55728lb. And a cubic foot of soft, by 10080lb. the proportion 5\u00bd to 1.\n\nA cubic foot of hard stone, supported upon two fulcrums at 1 foot distance, was broken by 205632lb., suspended from its middle; and the soft by 38592, the proportion about 5\u00bd to 1.\n\nIn fine, a cubic foot of the hard stone, was torn asunder by 45500lb.; and the soft by 15850lb. the proportion 2\u00bd to 1. Thus far Gauthey's account.\n\nIt is to be observed, that the above table does not strictly correspond with itself; for the proportion upon the square line, or \u00bc of an inch, in place of 10\u00bd is upwards of 11. Now the increase of force which crushes 96 square lines, and 128 one line thick, is 7.8oz. nearly upon the square line, that is a little more than \u00bc of 35 oz. upon the square line; then as 128 square lines is 4496 oz. so is 144 square lines to 5058, to which add one fifth, viz. 1011\u00be, this makes 6069\u00bd upon the square inch, and this multiplied by 144, the square inches in a foot, is 874022.4 oz. but Mr Gauthey says, that the square foot of surface of one foot deep, is of the strength of 870911lb.\n\nAgain, there is 20736 square lines in a square inch, the force upon a surface of 64 square inches, being about 11.5 upon each square line, is 238464 oz. upon the square foot. Upon the surface of 96 lines, 27 oz. to the square line, gives 559872 to the square foot. Upon the surface of 128 lines, 35\u00bd to the square line, is 878806 to the square foot, the proportion of 238464 oz. to 870911 is about 53\u00bd nearly, and of 559872 to 870911 is \u00bd nearly; but by the experiment the number 870911 is lbs. upon the square foot, the other numbers are only ozs. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> between the first difference, and between the pressing force of 6069\u00bdoz. upon the square inch, makes in that proportion 874022 oz. The increase of force from one square inch, to one square foot, must be \u00bc part of what the above experiment upon the square foot produces. Further experiments upon this therefore become necessary. In the mean time, we have no reason to doubt the experiment upon the square foot, or upon the smaller parts, intermediate experiments only can make them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a>.\n\nOne example adduced is of consequence. A pillar in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of All Saints, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGERS\">Angers</a>, of 24 feet height, and 11 inches square, supports a weight of 60000lb. that is \u00bc being added 86685.9 upon the square foot, which is said not to be \u00bc part of the load that would crush it. From this it is evident, that the load it supports, exceeds the weight of an arch of 50 feet span, of a semicircular form; the arch-stones being 24 feet long, or depth of the arch, and 2 feet in breadth. It is affected under the article Bridge, that instead of an arch \u00bd of the opening or 10 feet thick, that a pier of 2 feet thick would be sufficient, but that it is given twice the length of the arch-stone, that is 5 feet thick in place of\nof 10; but from this example, it is five times thicker than necessary, and has therefore superabundant strength, allowing even for the force of a current. How superfluous then will these clumsy piers be reckoned, whose sole effect is a useless obstruction to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>! But as our principal design at present is upon the strength of wood, in prosecution of this inquiry, we have paid particular attention to the strength of this material, in the transverse direction, in so far as it can be supported by experiment. Before we proceed to make particular application to its use, it will be necessary to consider its strength or power of resistance in its breadth and thickness. In this it may be with safety averred that such force as will bruise or crush its fibres, although only of $\\frac{1}{16}$ or $\\frac{1}{32}$ of an inch; the same weight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, will produce the same effect upon the next stratum, till the whole piece is bruised, and its cohesive power overcome. This is supported by the experiments of celebrated mechanicians, as those of Buffon, Mulchenbroek, Bouguer. Mulchenbroek, in his \u00c9l\u00e9mens de Physique, says, that a piece of found oak $\\frac{1}{32}$ of an inch is torn asunder by 1150lb.; and that a plank 12 inches broad, and 1 thick, will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> bear 189,168lbs. These give for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> of an inch, 15755, and 15763lbs. Bouguer in his Trait\u00e9 de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> says, that it is very well known that a rod of found oak, of $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch square, can be torn asunder by 1000lb. this gives 16,000 for the square inch. Bouguer speaks with certainty, that $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch square of found oak can be torn asunder by 1000lb. If we reduce the above proportions of the experiment, it will appear, that the force will be much greater than 16,000, to tear asunder a piece of found oak of one inch square. It must in the meantime be allowed, that Buffon's experiments being upon a larger scale, can be followed with more security than those upon a smaller scale.\n\nBut after all, we have not yet got sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATA\">data</a> to form a criterion for an arch; nor can this be expected till we have more precisely ascertained the strength of an arch above a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> line, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the horizon.\n\nIn the first place, as an arch is in form, one part of it towards the perpendicular, and the other towards a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> line; the force that it will sustain, is between that force that a body will carry in the perpendicular, and that which produces a fracture upon any material in the horizontal direction. If the perpendicular is greater than the horizontal line, it will have more of the strength of the bruising force, than of the transverse fracture; and the force may be expressed by the ratio compounded of the bruising or crushing force, and that of the transverse fracture; or not improperly expressed, as it has been denominated by others, the absolute and relative force.\n\nUnfortunately we have not yet a sufficient variety of experiments to ascertain the absolute force, as those made are only upon a small scale; and the number is not adequate to form a proportion of the increase for the force that will crush a piece of wood of $\\frac{1}{32}$, or as the French philosophers have done most this way, we take their measure $\\frac{1}{32}$ of an inch, or one line, and from that to an inch; but the force required is found to be greater than that of the square of the diameter, as also the force to produce a transverse fracture, or to give the relative strength. This increases in a greater ratio than that of the square of the diameters; for in the above experiments, the weight that broke a batten 4 inches square, was to that weight which broke an 8-inch square batten, each of the length of 7 feet, more than double of the square of 4 to the square of 8 as above; we are, therefore, much limited as to an exact procedure.\n\nAt the same time, by keeping the experiments in view, and the observations made upon them, we shall be able to give such a ratio, as to the necessary strength, as will furnish the ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> with a pretty sure principle to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> upon, and prevent his using superfluous materials, either in their application to horizontal right lines, or inclined in the right-lined direction, or in curves.\n\nIf we attend to the weight that crushes one inch of found oak, by Mulchenbroek's experiments, we find that it is 17,300lb., but, if computed from the increase, being as the squares of the diameters, it is only 16000lb. but it has been found as above, that the power to break, or make a transverse fracture in the same wood, of the same length, of different diameters, if a considerable difference in diameters is taken, the difference of weight is twice that produced by the square of the diameter. This comparison makes the proportion between the strength of stone, and that of wood, to be as 17,300 is to 6048, or 1 to $2\\frac{1}{3}$ nearly. Thus we may with a sufficient degree of accuracy substitute the one for the other in point of strength, and form a proportion between the arch and the strength of a horizontal line. As several experimentalists agree, that a square inch of wood can be crushed or pulled asunder with a weight of between 16,000 and 17,300lb., and that a piece of wood one inch square, 18 inches in length, can be broken by 456lb. or at 12 inches by 629, or at 6 inches by 1218; attending to the addition as mentioned above, which has been proved by comparison of experiments, to be upon the principle of the lever. If then, the geometrical mean is taken between the elevation of the arch, as pressure or absolute strength, and the length of the horizontal line, this mean will be the strength of the arch above the horizontal line; for it is evident, that so much as the piece of wood is elevated towards the perpendicular, so much the nearer it approaches to its absolute strength, and by so much as the arch is flatter or the piece of wood less inclined, the nearer it is to a straight line, and so much the more reduced to its relative strength; the position of the arch, therefore, must be in the ratio compounded of these two.\n\nHaving now established the principles, let us endeavour to apply them to practice, in forming a centre or supporting an arch, to produce the intended curvature or mould for an arch, of any intended span, and at the same time, have strength to support the same. Several ingenious artists, have not only formed, but have written and laid down principles for forming these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a>, both with regard to strength and economy; at the same time we have not found any that have treated the subject upon principles that are fully established. We have, therefore been the more particular, according to the principles laid down. If, We have affigned the weight to be supported, as established by uncontroverted principles. And, adly, established the strength of\nof wood as to its thickness or diameter, that is sufficient to sustain such weight; which we have supported by the most approved experiments, comparing one with the other; and in the third place, we have considered the effects when the materials are applied in the horizontal direction, or elevated in any degree toward the perpendicular.\n\nIn a work of this kind, it is not only necessary to lay before our readers well grounded principles, and a well supported theory, but along with these, the different opinions, and various modes used by the most distinguished artists, who have exhibited their plans to the public, together with the principles on which they were founded, and the success they have met with, in answering the purposes proposed.\n\nAmong the most distinguished who have treated this subject, we may consider Pitot a member of the Academy of Sciences, who wrote about the beginning of the last century. His method undoubtedly shows considerable ingenuity; but, at the same time, we must observe that he has been rather too profuse in the quantity of materials which he has employed.\n\nTo lay his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of operation before our readers, we shall give a figure showing the construction. The arch of the circle or ellipse being formed; as little or no weight lies upon the center, till between 30 and 35 degrees of the arch, a stretcher is extended at this height, to the same height on the opposite side; two struts support this stretcher from the spring of the arch; upon the upper part of the stretcher, immediately above, or a little within the upper end of the truss on each side, two spars joining upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a>, spring from about the middle of the arch, the stretcher being divided into four parts. Another strut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> from the rife of the arch, meeting the stretcher at this fourth part, from each side of the arch; these last struts are joined by a tie-beam, which gives additional strength to the first stretcher; upon these, on the upper side of the stretcher, two spars join the king-post, a little below the other; these spars are joined by bridles, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> spars, from the circular arch, to the lower strut; ribs of the same formation being placed at proper distances, according to the width of the bridge, and joined by bridging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>, which may be of greater or lesser strength, according to the span of the arch; and of consequence the weight it has to support. Pitot is the first writer who has given us any account of the method of forming frames, according to the above general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. If no rests are left at the spring of the arch, as a base for the center to rest upon; let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a> fig. 1. Plate CXXXVIII. be the ends of two planks raised from the foundation, upon which the center may rest; let CD, be the stretcher, extended about 35 or 40 degrees from the spring of the arch; or, as little weight rests upon the center till that height, the stretcher may be as high as 45 degrees; let AE, AG, BD, BG be the two struts on each side; from each extremity of the center, let BE, AE be fixed to the stretcher near C, and D, and AG, BG, at 1/2 of CD; their stretcher or tie-beam GG, equal to one half of CD, the bridles, 1, 2, 3 &c., from A to C, and from B to D, are intended to prevent the arch from yielding; from A to C, and from B to D. The struts EF, EP, meeting the king-post K, in F, and the interior struts GH, GH, meeting the king-post in H, support the bridles 4, 5, 6, on each side of the king-post; their use, is to stiffen the frame of the center, which supports the upper and more weighty part of the arch.\n\nThe arch for which Pitot allots this center, is of 60 feet span; and the arch lines seven feet in length, the weight of a solid cubic foot he makes 160lb. The Portland stone is admitted to weigh 160lb.; but we do not find any other freestone of such weight. It is however to be considered, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> foot is 12,788 of our inches, that is, a little more than 12 1/2ths of our measure, which will make a difference of the weight upon the foot; as also their lb. is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> than ours about 1.2 oz. by which the stone here mentioned is not better than ours. In a matter of this kind, such exactness is not necessary. As was proposed, we first consider the weight to be supported by the frame, and here it is evident from the figure that no strain lies upon the frame below C; the arch is raised, or can be raised to this height, before the frame is set; therefore the perpendicular CC determines the limits of the absolute pressure upon the frame. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> Cee prelifes on the frame, and the triangle Cfg adds to the lateral pressure; the weight of the arch, that actually presses upon the frame, is contained between the perpendicular lines Cc, Dd; no more can press upon the center frame. The part of the arch below C, will rest upon the abutment, raised upon the pier; but if it is insisted that there is a pressure upon the lower part of the center frame, what can only possibly rest, or press upon it, must be contained between the parallels Cc and fg; although it will be admitted, that the arch can be raised to the height C, without the center frame; but to indulge such as say it is not advisable to do it, we will admit what lies between these parallels to press upon the frame. Now to determine the weight of these parts of the arch, the distance between the perpendiculars Cc, Dd is 53 feet; the arch-stone is 7 feet, and admit it to be three feet broad, 53 X 7 X 3 X 160lb. = 178,080lb.\n\nTo determine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> between the two parallels Cc, fg, the line fg perpendicular to the diameter AB, is 13 1/2, the base is 9 1/2, and Cf perpendicular to it is 7 feet, the area is 33 1/2 feet; Cc the base of the triangle Cfc is 7.2, and fc is 7; the area is 25, the difference is 8 1/2. If this difference had been the excess of the triangle Cfc above the triangle Cfg, it would have been a pressure upon the frame; but as it is the reverse, the pressure is upon the abutment. This distinction is requisite to be taken notice of, that an unnecessary expense of wood and workmanship be not expended, where it is unnecessary; as well as its being unworkman-like, or having an appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> in the engineer.\n\nLet us now inquire, what strength of materials is sufficient to support this weight. It has been laid down as a principle, that the parts of wood in an arch act upon one another by their absolute strength; but are liable to the transverse fracture; in proportion to the length of the piece, in a span of 60 feet, the length of the piece may be 7 feet without sensibly impairing its strength, in reducing it to the round; and experiment gives the relative strength of 7 feet to be 47649lb. by 8 inches square. It has been formerly illustrated from\nCenter, from experiments, that the strength is according to the depth, with this precaution, that the breadth or thickness be such, that it is prevented from warping, the absolute strength being nearly, by last experiment mentioned, as the squares of the depth. The absolute strength to the relative force, has been found nearly 60 to 1, although by some it is said to be only 42 to 1; the absolute strength of the plank 12 inches broad by one thick, is 189163lb.; if two inches, it would be no more than 189163lb. If it had been 8 inches square, then every 7 feet of the arch might be broken with the weight 189163lb.; but the whole weight of the arch is only 178080lb. that is 11080 less weight than what that part of the frame would bear; but 7 feet is only about one-seventh part of 53; the frame is therefore of sufficient strength to support the whole weight of the arch when equally divided along its whole length. This is not the case with the centre frame of an arch, as it is loaded at one place, and not at another; it is therefore apt to yield between the parts where the load is laid; that is, it may rise in the middle, and thus change the form of the arch; for the centre frame is not only intended to support the arch, but likewise to preserve its true form; for this cause some struts may be necessary to prevent its putting the arch out of shape. To remedy this, where the arch begins to press upon the frame at C, draw the chord line C c, fig. 2, which acts as a tie-beam to the arch, from C at 35 degrees to c at 51 degrees, as beyond this, if the arch frame had been permitted to alter its shape, it would begin to be restored to it, at least the force would tend that way. At that part of the arch, where its weight begins to flatten the frame, as at 2, draw the stretcher 2, 2, which likewise acts as a tie-beam, and gives support to the bridge 1, on one side, and to 3 the bridge upon the other side, from D d; and thus the arch c d is prevented from sinking by the tie-beam e d. This will effectually prevent any warping or yielding of the frame, notwithstanding the enormous load from the size of the arch stones.\n\nBut it is necessary to attend to the relative strength of different kinds of timber of which frames may be constructed. The relative proportion of the strength of oak and fir has been ascertained by different experiments; and although the results do not exactly agree, yet the mean or least proportion may be taken. Let us take $\\frac{6}{10}$, that of Buffon. Now to reduce a frame of oak to one of fir of equal strength, divide 8 inches, the diameter of the oak, by $\\frac{6}{10}$, the relative strength of fir, this gives 1$\\frac{1}{2}$ inches. Allow 1$\\frac{1}{2}$ inches. The depth of the frame will then be 9$\\frac{1}{2}$ inches by $\\frac{3}{4}$ or $\\frac{3}{4}$ inches in breadth; that is, 9$\\frac{1}{2}$ by 2$\\frac{1}{2}$ inches. In this way the strength of the fir arch is rendered equal, and by the additional allowance superior to the oak in strength, and of less expense in wood and workmanship.\n\nWe have here taken the most simple method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> and computation, that every mechanic, whether scientific or not, can easily follow it in every step, and judge of the propriety or impropriety of what is advanced.\n\nIt will now be necessary to follow Mr Pitot in estimating the quantity of materials which he allows. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> of his arches consists of pieces of oak 12 inches broad and six thick. The stretcher CD is 12 inches square, the straining piece GG is likewise 12 inches square, the lower struts 10 inches by 8; the king-post 12 inches square, the upper struts 10 by 6, the ridges 20 by 8, French measure. Pitot allows the square inch to carry 8650lb. that is, one half of the absolute strength, which is ascertained by experiment to be 173000lb. nearly, and not by the square of the diameter, which would be only 16000lb. But on account of knots he reduces it to 7200lb. per inch. He then computes the whole load upon the frame to be 707520lb. which is the weight of the whole archstones, supposing each to be 3 feet broad, and the whole to press upon the frame. This comes so very near, that it would be needless to dispute about the difference. We have shown that no more than 178080lb. presses upon the frame; but we are not so fully satisfied as to the weight that rests upon the center. Pitot supposes it to be $\\frac{11}{13}$ths of the whole weight; but he has assigned no reason for this conjecture. Mr Couplet affirms that it presses by $\\frac{4}{5}$ths. Another writer who makes some comment upon the whole, says that $\\frac{4}{5}$ths is nearer the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> than $\\frac{4}{5}$ths, but gives no reason for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, which seems to be equally vague as the other. The pressure here allowed, and the reason of assigning such a pressure, have been already explained. Our readers, therefore, have it in their power to examine the principles, and decide for themselves.\n\nIt has been asserted by some, that the arch does not press upon the center frame below C. At the same time, were we inclined to dispute this opinion, we might state our objection in the following manner: Suppose the area of the triangle C c f was equal to the area of the triangle C f g, so that the friction above would make the triangle C c f rest upon the side c f; and as the triangle C f g is greater than C c f in the proportion of 33$\\frac{1}{2}$lbs to 25$\\frac{1}{2}$d, the cohesion of the parts will determine the intermediate space between C c and g f, to rest upon the abutment as has been said, and not on the perpendicular, unless a fissure is made in the direction g f, in which case it would be detached from the lateral pressure, and so rest upon the center. As this is not the case, any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEA\">plea</a> for a pressure below C is entirely removed; and a method to determine with precision the actual pressure upon the center frame is shewn. If the arch is the center of a circle, or an ellipse, a frame so much stronger is necessary, as more of the arch presses upon the frame; but the method of determining the strength is the same as here laid down. A second figure of the ellipse, and another calculation are required. It is here to be understood, that the frame calculated for is only one rib; and the weight it supports is that of the arch stones, between the parallels C c, D d, to three feet in breadth. If, therefore, the bridge is 42 feet broad, it requires 14 ribs of the above strength. These are joisted over with planks, suppose of two inches thick, and upon these the archstones are laid, equally carried on from C and D, and rising equally on each side, till the key-stone is let, in which state they remain, till the engineer judges it proper to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLACKEN\">slacken</a> the frame, by striking out the wedges at the rests, A and B, (or as the French use logs between the frame and arch), so far as to allow the archstones to press upon one another, by the equilibrated curvature.\ncurvature of the arch; after which, it being found that the arch is perfectly just and secure, the frame is entirely removed. In the frame, fig. 2, the tie-beams are not taken into the account for strength, the arch being abundantly strong without them. Their use is merely to stiffen the frame, on account of the manner in which the weight is laid on. In an elliptic arch, it has been mentioned that it is somewhat different, requiring more strength and the binding likewise different. In what are termed elliptic arches, few or none are strictly so, the true elliptic curve being difficult to form on so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> a scale. It may therefore be acceptable to our readers, and also to the ingenious mechanic, if we give the form of an ellipse that will answer nearly to the elliptic equation, and upon an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> plan, easy of construction. The greater and lesser axes of the ellipse being given, divide the excess of the greater axis above the lesser into three equal parts; let off two of these from the center of the greater axis each way; upon this distance describe an equilateral triangle on each side of the greater axis, and produce the sides of the triangle both ways from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a> of these triangles, to the extremity of the lesser axis; describe two arches, till terminated by the sides of the triangle produced, gives the flat part of the ellipse. At the intersection of the produced sides of the triangle, as a center with the distance of the extremity of the greater axis, describe an arch which will meet the other arch and complete the ellipse.\n\nLet AB, fig. 3, be the greater axis 60, and DE the lesser axis 40, be drawn at right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, bisecting one another in C. Set off AF 40, upon AB, then the excess FB is 20, which divide into three parts; set off two of these from C to G and H; upon GH describe the equilateral triangles GHK, GHL; produce KG, KH, to any indefinite length, which may be cut by the arch drawn through D and E, from the centers KL at the intersections GH, and distance AB, let the other part of the ellipse be described, thus an universal method of describing a beautiful ellipse, and so just that it answers the elliptic equation exceedingly near, at least till it becomes very flat.\n\nA second form of a center frame described by Pitot, is adapted to an elliptical arch. The construction differs nothing from the former, only the two upper struts are parallel; the strength as in the former is superabundant, which is easily accounted for, from not knowing the real weight that lies upon the frame, or by considering the whole weight of the arch to rest upon the frame. Both this and the former, Pitot has considered as divisible into three pieces, which renders it more manageable in erecting, particularly in large spans. See fig. 4.\n\nFontana has given a description of a very neat frame consisting of two pieces, the upper and the lower. The struts 1, 2, 3 taken from Fig. 4, leave a representation of Fontana's frame. Different constructions being laid before our readers, the ingenious artist may improve the hints that have been thrown out; and thus form a more simple, or better construction.\n\nWe shall now select draughts of the most approved center frames that we are able to collect; and make such remarks upon them as may occur. Fig. 5, exhibits a form, which the experienced engineer will readily allow to be neat and ingenious; but there is much more wood and work expended than is necessary. It is divided into two parts, the base or stretcher LL, of the upper part, resting upon the lower part of the frame, the greatest part of which at least, must appear quite superfluous. The lower rests, EF, appear only necessary to prevent the stretcher LL from yielding, and thereby allowing the arch to lose its true curvature.\n\nThe general maxim of construction adopted by Perronet, a celebrated French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a>, is to make the truss consist of several courses of separate trusses, independent, as he supposes, of each other, and thus to employ the united support of them all. Each truss spans over the whole distance of the piers. It consists of a number of struts, set end to end, so as to form a polygon. By this construction, the angles of the ultimate trusses, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in lines pointing towards the center of the curve. It is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of Perrault, a physician and architect, and was practised by Manfard de Sagonne at the great bridge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULINS\">Moulins</a>.\n\nIn the centering of the bridge of Cravant, fig. 6, the arches are elliptic. The longer axis or span is 60 feet, the semitransverse axis or rise 20 feet. The arch-frames weigh 176lb. per foot, and are four feet in length, which is the thickness of the arch. The truss beams were from 15 to 18 feet long, and 9 inches deep by 8 broad. The whole frame was constructed of oak. The distance between the trusses, which were five in number, 5\u00bd feet. The whole weight of the arch amounted to 1350,000lb. which is nearly equal to 600 tons, making 112 tons for the weight on each truss. Ninety tons of this must be allowed really to press the trusses; but a great part of the pressure is sustained by the four beams which make the feet of the truss, joined in pairs on each side. The diagonal of the parallelogram of forces drawn for these beams is to one of the sides as 360 to 285. Then 360:285:190:17\u00bd tons the weight on each foot. The section of each is 14\u00be inches. Three tons may be laid with perfect safety on every inch; and the amount of this is 432 tons, which is six times more than the real pressure on the foot-beams in their longitudinal direction. The absolute strength of each foot-beam is equal to 216 tons. But being more advantageously placed, the diagonal of the parallelogram of forces which corresponds to its position is to the side as 438 to 285. This is equal to 58\u00bd tons for the strain on each foot; which is not much above one-fourth of the pressure it is able to bear. This kind of centering, therefore, undoubtedly possesses the advantage of superabundant strength. The upper row of struts is quite sufficient; nothing is wanted but to procure stiffness for it.\n\nIn his executing the bridge at Neuilly, fig. 7, of 120 feet span, and only 30 feet rise; the arch 5 feet thick; his strut-beams are 17 by 14 inches of size, and king-post 15 by nine, the strut-beams placed in three parallel polygons, each abutting upon the king-post, he uses the binders or bridges of 9 inches square. This arch is remarkable for its flatness. The account Perronet gives of his success with this frame, and the effects produced in his work, are as follows. Notwithstanding the different improvements he had made upon his center frame, he here found that it sunk 13 inches, before\nCenter, the key-stones were set, and that the crown rose and sunk as the different courses were laid. At 20 courses on each side, with a load of 16 tons upon the crown, it sunk an inch; when 20 more courses were laid, it sunk half an inch more, and continued sinking as the work advanced. When the keystone was set, it had sunk 13 inches; and, as it sunk at the crown, and in the advance to the crown, it rose at the haunches, so as to open the upper parts of the joints almost an inch; which gradually lessened towards the crown, and of consequence the joints in the lower part opened as the upper part was compressed. This no doubt showed a suppleness in the frame, and at the same time inattention in the architect, to load the crown when he perceived it sinking, with having already too much weight upon it. If he had observed the crown to rise, it would then have been proper to give it additional weight.\n\nLet us now attend to the description of the center frame of the bridge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a>, fig. 8. The architect to this bridge was Hupeau; and it is universally allowed to be an elegant structure. The arch stones are six feet in length, the form is elliptical, the span 100 feet, and rise 30. Hupeau died before any of the arches were complete. The center-frame had been placed, and some rows of the arch laid. Upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMISE\">demise</a>, Perronet succeeded as architect, and finished the bridge. As the work advanced, he found that the crown of the center rose; he then found it sink as remarkably, which showed that there was some defect: he inserted the long beam AB, on each side; he then found the frame sufficiently stiff; for this made a change in the nature of the strut.\n\nHaving taken a view of the practice of the French architects, as to their form and effects, let us <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> our attention to those of our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, which are well worthy of notice. We shall only name some that have used trussings, and among these we find the center-frame of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACKFRIARS\">Blackfriars</a> bridge, fig. 9. The span here is 100 feet; the form is elliptical, the arch-stones from the haunches seven feet, near the key-stone not quite so much, as they decrease in length from the haunch to the key-stone.\n\nA particular description of this arch is not necessary; a view of the figure will show the use of the different parts; it may be sufficient to observe, that when the arch stone was placed, it had changed its shape only one inch, and when the frame was taken out, the arch remained firm without any sinking of consequence. The great arch did not sink above one inch, and none of them above an inch and a half; whereas those already mentioned, sunk by the supple-ness of the frame 13 inches, and some of them 9 inches more when the frame was removed.\n\nDifferent methods are employed for easing the frame, or disengaging it from its weight. We shall give a short description of Mr Mylne's method of placing and detaching his center frame from the mason work. Each end of the truss was mortised into a plank of oak cut in the lower part as in the figure; a similar piece of oak was placed to receive the upper part of the planks. The blocks rested upon these planks, but were not mortised into them, pieces of wood being interposed. The upper part of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> was cut similar to the lower part of the other; the wedge E, being intended to be driven between them, was notched as in the figure, and filled up with small pieces of wood, to prevent the wedge from sliding back by the weight of the arch; which, it will appear from the figure, would have been the case: the event proved the fact. When the centre was to be struck, the inserted pieces of wood were taken out, and the wedge which was prepared for driving back, by being girt with a ferril round the top, was removed by a piece of iron driven in with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> so broad as to cover the whole of the wood. A plank of wood was prepared armed with iron in the same manner at the one end, and suspended so that it could freely act in driving back the wedge to any distance, however small, with certainty. Thus, by an equal gradation, the centre was eased from the arch, which appeared to have been so equally supported throughout the whole of the operation, and the arch stones so properly laid, that it did not sink above one inch; and thus it was evident that the center might be entirely removed, having completely answered the purpose.\n\nThe above examples may be considered as sufficient to show the effects of the trussed arches, which have been employed by the French architects. We shall now take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of suggesting some hints which may tend to improve the construction, and remedy the faults and failures that have occurred in practice.\n\nTrussed arches for center frames being found expedient in navigable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, and almost in every river which is apt to be raised by rains, or other rise in the river, the frame is apt to be endangered or carried off, to the great risk of bringing down the arch, and ruining the work before it is finished. In arches where there is no such danger, the frame may be properly secured by posts from below, which are made to abut upon those parts of the arch, where the greatest strain must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>.\n\nIn the center used by Pitot we have only to complain of an unnecessary expenditure of wood and workmanship. We have already shown what strength of oak is necessary, and have reduced that strength of oak to an equal strength of fir wood for the ring of his frame, which alone ought to have the strength required to be fully adequate to the load; but as this weight must be gradually applied, the frame must likewise have such a degree of firmness as to form the exact mould of the arch that is intended. And, for this purpose, it must be prevented from yielding in any part of its arch. Now, as it has been made to appear, that the frame supports no part of the arch till it rises from the spring to about 35 degrees, if a semicircle, and so in proportion for a segment of a circle; in an ellipse, to a part similar according to the nature of that curve; the supporting struts and ties can be more particularly directed to support that part of the arch which produces the greater strain upon the center. In fig. 2, where the necessary strength for Pitot's arch is pointed out, the frame of fir requisite to stiffen the frame, is 9\u00bd by 2\u00bd. The tie-beam Cc is joined to those parts of the arch, where the strain being greatest, would tend most to raise it in the crown. The strength of this tie-beam being 9\u00bd by 2\u00bd, and its length 25 feet, would require a weight of 30493 lb. to make the transverse\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a> fracture, one-third of this at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDLE\">bridle</a> 1, 3, is sufficient to resist the strain at that part of the arch; and the abutment, being according to the principles laid down under the article Bridge, prevents the possibility of its rising at the haunches; but if not formed according to their principles, the two tie-beams Cc Dd are joined by a third tie-beam 2, 2 with its bridle 3, 4. Fig. 4. is Pitot's centering for his elliptic arch: the strength of fig. 2 may suffice to this by giving the ring and tie-beams an inch more depth.\n\nFig. 6 represents two centerings used by Perronet; A is that used by him in erecting the bridge at Nogent, and B that at Maxence; they differ little from one another. That at Nogent is 90 feet by 25 feet height. The span of the latter being greater, we shall here consider the weight to be supported. This is the arch from A to C, which is an arch of 47\u00b0 45'. The measurement is 42 feet; the arch-stones 4\u00bd, and supposing them 3 feet broad, they would amount to 567.9 solid feet, which, at 160 lb. per foot, is equal to 90866.88 lb. This is little more than one half of the semicircular arch; and, although it is flatter, the weight is so much less, that no additional strength is necessary to be given to the frame, fig. 2, for the 60 feet span. There is likewise abundance of strength of materials for the 90 feet arch; but on the greater extent, that it may be rendered more stiff, a tie-beam 1, 4, 3, 4 may be added on each side of the arch, as represented by the dotted line.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to make any farther calculations on the centering used by Perronet. It appears, that notwithstanding the superabundance of wood employed, they were so supple as when used upon an extended arch, they rose and sunk so much, that the arch was changed from its intended form by a radius of several feet. These changes took place in erecting the bridges at Nogent and Maxence, which are represented in fig. 6. Perronet, it would appear, was not satisfied with these; and, convinced of their insufficiency, changed the form of the frame of the bridge at Nogent. But this form is far from answering the purpose; for, when the arch-stones began to press upon the centering, it yielded to the weight. He then loaded the crown to prevent its rising there, but it still sunk; he added more weight to the crown, it continued sinking as the work advanced. When the key-stone was set, it had sunk more than 13 inches, and it was found to have raised the haunches; for when the centering was slackened, the arch still sunk for about 9 inches more. The arch-stones being raised at the haunches, the joints were of necessity opened; for the pressure from the crown, when the centering was removed, forced them again into contact, by which the arch flattened to such a degree, that from an arch intended to have a radius of 150 feet, it flattened till part of it was, as if formed from a radius of 244 feet. It here appeared to be settled, from which a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFORMITY\">deformity</a> must appear in the structure; which deformity took its rise from two evident causes: The want of firmness in the centering, and the bridge not properly loaded at the haunches. It is evident, that if the load at the haunches is only equal to the weight of the arch-stones from the place where they begin to rest on the centering to the crown of the arch, the pressure of the arch could never overcome itself or its equal weight upon the haunches; much more, if the weight upon the haunches, before it comes to press upon the centering, was made to exceed that part of the arch that did press upon it, the load upon the crown of the arch would have restored the figure of the centering. It seems to be a strange oversight, that Perronet, when he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> that his centering was rising at the haunches, did not apply his loading to this part of the arch, by which he might have restored it to its equilibrium before his center was struck, and before his lime had lost the band; if this is once done, it is allowed, that it does not again recover it.\n\nFrom the whole of this it appears evident, that filling up the haunches to a proper height, so as to make a firm abutment to the pressing part of the arch, serves two good purposes. It acts as an abutment to the center frame, in preventing its sinking by the load as the work advances; and likewise prevents the arch-stones at the haunches being raised from their beds; for it is only acted upon by a force considerably less than what they have a power to resist. Having now seen the defects of this centering, and animadverted on the manner of executing the work, let us now examine the weight of this arch, and what resilliance would have prevented its change in shape, and preserved its intended form.\n\nThe part of the arch that presses upon the center, is from C to C, fig. 16, an arch of 36 degrees, and measures 94\u00bd feet nearly; the stones 5 feet in length, and breadth 3, make 1079.035 solid feet, \u00d7 160 lb., the weight of a solid foot, make the whole weight 316645.88 lb. Allow each beam of the truss to be 7 feet, and its absolute strength, to tear it at 12 inches deep, by one inch thick, 189163; the absolute power of transverse fracture, 93416 lb. The strength of the arch is the mean of these, or ratio compounded, taking one-third of each, the geometrical mean is 44285 lb.; that each 7 feet can sustain when formed into an arch; there are 13 times 7 in 94 feet, equal to a power of 582764, to sustain the weight of 316645.88 lb. if equally distributed. But this not being the case, a tie-beam of about 30 feet marked cc, dd, will prevent the arch yielding to the prelure. It is supported at e by the struts Ee, hb; and these by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> support of ef, bf at k. The whole center frame is supported by the upright posts CC, DD. Two wedges A and B are placed across between two blocks, which are fitted for a rest to the frame. When it is required to be slackened, and the frame withdrawn from the arch, they allow it to rest by its own prelure. This it must appear obvious, ought to be done when the key-stone is let before the lime has begun to be dry and solid.\n\nThe center frame of the bridge of Orleans is represented fig. 8. It has been already noticed in this undertaking, that Perronet succeeded Hupeau. As the work advanced, he found the arch and frame to sink, and trying his ordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of loading the crown of the arch, he was now taught by experience to strengthen his center frame, and happily succeeded by continuing his strut. By forming the base of the triangle 1, 2, 3, on each side, his frame was rendered sufficiently stiff, and the inner part below AB, AB became superfluous. The weight that presses upon this frame is great, both\non account of the flatness of the arch, and the length of the arch-stone. The pressing arch is an arch of 57 degrees; it measures 88.87 feet, \u00d7 6 the length of the arch-stone, and by 3 in width, makes 1599.66 solid feet \u00d7 60lb. the weight of a solid foot, gives 255945.6lb.\n\nThe length of each plank of the truss being 7 feet, depth 12 inches by 2 inches thick, the strength is 189163lb. The weight for every 7 feet in length of the arch, one-third of this 63054.3lb. in 88 feet, there is 12 times 7, that is 63054.3 \u00d7 12 = 756,652lb. to support 255945.6lb. more than 3 times stronger, without taking into account the strength of the arch, being the mean of the splitting force and transverse section: the tie-beams, as in fig. 7, will be of abundant strength to stiffen the frame.\n\nThe next we take notice of is, the truss frame, fig. 9, used by Mr Mylne, at Blackfriars bridge, London, this is supported by ties and struts in such a manner, that no sinking took place during the main work going on, although the arch-stones at the haunches were 7 feet, gradually lessening to the crown of the arch; and, when the frame was struck, which was done by a very ingenious method, by the wedges of the instructions as in the figure, in place of sinking 9 inches, it did not sink above 1, which may well be accounted for by the compression of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a>; whether a smaller quantity of materials might not have answered the same purpose, such as fig. 7, we shall refer to the judicious reader, or to the ingenious artist who may have occasion to depend upon such frames for support of this work, or a tie beam between 1 and 3 on each side, represented by the dotted line. As there is a strain upon the frame at s, s, let these tie-beams be supported by the struts a, b, c on each side, and tied at 4, 4 as represented by the dotted line 4, 4. It does not appear that what lies between the dotted line a, 4, 4 b bears any part in the support or stiffness of the frame, and therefore becomes unnecessary; nor does it appear, that the different beams used as king-polls are of so much advantage for strengthening the frame, as tie-beams would be. At the same time, those used by Mr Mylne are employed with so much judgement, that none of their effects are misapplied. This cannot be said of any of the frames used by the French architects, even of that used at the bridge of Orleans. They are not often employed by the British architects; they rather prefer a tie-beam at the spring of the arch from one side to the other. This, however, might be as judiciously applied at the height where the arch begins to rest upon the frame, especially if the shoulders are properly loaded or filled up, so as to be a counterpoise to the arch-stones, that rest upon the frame. In this case they effectually prevent the necessity of a tie-beam, as a diameter at the spring of the arch; and from the spring proper supports may be given at the upper tie-beam, and from it to any part of the arch, where the greatest strain lies.\n\nHaving from the examples adduced, and the observations made upon them, found center-frames of sufficient strength to support arches of very extensive spans, and even greater extent than they have yet been applied; it may be said, why not continue these frames for the bridge, without the very great additional expense of throwing a stone arch over them? The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>-\n\nson would answer, that the stone was more durable, and had other advantages, particularly as to neatness, when once thrown, and freed from the unclean trusses and tie-beams necessary in the wooden frame. The carpenter would reply, that if wood was not so durable as stone, it could be raised at much less expense; and, when it failed in any part, it could be replaced at a small expense, and made to last longer than a stone arch; which latter, when it fails, requires as much expense as at first, and even more, in clearing off the rubbish of its decayed and now useless materials. As to neatness, the frame of wood vie's with the arch of stone in elegance, and is erected at half the expense, and even less. But now since iron materials are introduced in place of stone, there is room for experiments with regard to neatness and extent of span.\n\nWe shall here suppose the carpenter exhibits this plan. Let A.B be a span of 60 feet, (fig. 11,) the arch a semicircle, the absolute strength of oak a plank 12 inches by 1 is 189163lb. Let the arch be composed of pieces 5 feet long, 12 inches deep, and 2 inches broad; a second arch joining to this, of the same depth and breadth in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> contact, but the joints of the one to the middle of the other, like brick-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, or as the carpenter's expresses breaking-joint. The absolute strength of this arch is, before the two trusses are joined, more than 84 ton, as may be collected from the calculations above, which is more than 3 times what can ever come upon it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of this arch would be hurt by placing struts below to stiffen it, for which there is not the smallest occasion; for it can be stiffened to better advantage above the arch. But this is not practicable in center-frames. Let the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>-way be CDEF, resting upon the perpendicular support 1, 2, 3, &c. As the carriage acts upon them in the oblique direction, transfers from the arch in a radial direction, give them the advantage of equal pressure upon the arch. Each of these perpendiculars is mortised into short pieces, that will form into an arch, the pieces all abutting one upon another, and forming a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILLET\">fillet</a> over the arch, and projecting so far, that the faces of an architrave, of any order may be formed along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the arch, which adds both to its strength and beauty. Thus there is formed a rib, 12 inches deep and 4 thick, with its fillet over it 4 inches deep and six inches broad, to cover the faces of the architrave. Suppose the arch 44 feet wide, 7 of these ribs may give a strength not inferior to the strength of stone or any metal; but it will be said, it will not be so durable. It is well known how long wood lasts in the roofs, and joints of flooring, and even when it forms a part of the wall of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> built of brick. The interstices between these perpendicular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARINGS\">bearings</a> of the wood may be built up with brick; even brick on edge, or brick thick, will render its preservation equal to what it is in a house, and will preserve it from the bad effects of wet and dry; and the lower part of the ribs covered with a thin lining. A door being left in the side to observe at different times any failure in the wood, it may be repaired without interrupting the passage by the bridge. It ought to be so covered above, that water may be prevented from going through to the injury of the bridge. It has been formerly mentioned, in speaking\ning of the proportional strength of oak and fir, and by the calculation it appeared, that fir plank $13\\frac{1}{2}$ inches, is equal in strength to oak of 12 inches. And thus a framing of wood does not much exceed the expense of centering either a stone or iron bridge; and is not inferior even in elegance.\n\nThe span here proposed, is only 60 feet. But an arch of 600 feet may be required, which must have a centering to support the weight and preserve the figure; the size of that center frame can be made of strength equal and even to exceed the weight it has to support. It can be rendered stiff by the method proposed for the 60 feet arch. This, therefore, will be a bridge that will support any weight that can be laid upon it, and may be of any figure, elliptical, or at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of the architect, any other curve which may be required. It may be framed in a similar manner to those formed of iron, but it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to suppose that one arch over the other will be equally strong and more easily preserved from the weather, constructed in the way described above.\n\nIn the simple wooden bridges not curved, it is only necessary to refer to fig. 7, where the struts $E_c, f_s, b_g$, will be a support for planks, that will form a straight bridge, joining so many ribs as are necessary for the bridge according to its breadth.\n\nThe joints may be secured from opening by dovetail pieces being inserted across the joints on the inside of the rib; the abutments prevent the ends of the arch from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> out. The pressure above coming upon it obliquely, may be said to tend to make it rise at the crown, especially when of a great span. In the center-frame, the only manner of preventing this is by struts and tie-beams judiciously applied. Here the rise may be prevented more effectually without hurting the ornamental part of the arch. In the abutment, which must be of masonry-work, let a beam be built into the wall, the ends at G and K projecting 1 foot, corresponding to each rib, the road-way formed by the beam DE, let a tie-beam GD, KE, join these in the manner the carpenter knows to be the most secure; from this tie-beam, let the radial struts be mortised into the fillets at G, K, formerly described, instead of the perpendiculars there named, and perpendiculars joining the roadway CDEF, and resting on the tie-beam GD, KE, supported by the radial struts 4, 5, 6, as in the figure. Thus the crown of the arch cannot rise without lifting up the whole body of the abutment at each end, and it cannot sink till the weight laid upon it is sufficient to crush the materials of which the arch is composed. In this manner a neat and elegant arch is procured, that may at a small comparative expense be kept up for centuries. Here is then a choice of three species of arches, that may vie with each other in point of strength. With the last none may compare in point of elegance, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, perhaps not inferior to the iron bridge.\n\n**Center of Gravity**, in Mechanics, that point about which all the parts of a body do in any situation exactly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> each other.\n\n**Center of Motion**, that point which remains at rest, while all the other parts of a body move about it.\n\n**Center of a Sphere**, a point in the middle, from which all lines drawn to the surface are equal.\n\nHermes Trismegistus defines God an intellectual Centrum sphere, whose center is everywhere, and circumference nowhere.","sp":322,"ep":334},{"h":"CENTESIMA USURA","t":"that wherein the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> in a hundred months became equal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a>, i.e., where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> is laid out at one per cent. per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>; answering to what in our style would be called 12 per cent. for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> reckoned their interest not by the year, but by the month.","sp":334,"ep":334},{"h":"CENTESIMATION","t":"a milder kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of desertion, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTINY\">mutiny</a>, and the like, when only every hundredth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> is executed.","sp":334,"ep":334},{"h":"CENTILOQUIUM","t":"denotes a collection of 100 sentences, opinions, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> sayings.\n\nThe centiloquium of Hermes contains 100 aphorisms, or astrological sentences, supposed to have been written by some Arab, falsely fathered on Hermes Trismegistus.

The weights of the metallurgists are easily understood, as being of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> proportion; but those of the assayers are a thousand times smaller than these, as the portions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> or ores examined by the assayers are usually very small.\n\nThe metallurgists, who extract metals out of their ores, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> a weight divided into a hundred equal parts, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>; the whole they call a centner or hundred weight; the pound is divided into thirty-two parts, or half ounces; and the half ounce into two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of ounces, and these each into two drachms.\n\nThese divisions and denominations of the metallurgists are easily understood; but the same words, though they are equally used by assayers, with them express very different quantities; for as the centner of the metallurgists contains a hundred pounds, the centner of the assayers is really <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more than one dram, to which the other parts are proportioned.\n\nAs the assayers weights are divided into such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of minuteness, and are so very different from all the common weights, the assayers usually make them themselves in the following manner, out of small silver, or fine folder plates, of such a size, that the mark of their weight, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the dram, which is the docimastic or assaying centner, may be put upon them.

When it is brought to be perfectly even and equal to the lead, they change the scales to see that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> has been committed, and then go on in the same manner till they have made all the divisions, and all the small weights.

At the upper part of the tube is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> cog-wheel, which touches the cogs of another in a vertical position; so that by the help of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> winch, the whole machine is moved round with very great velocity.\n\nNear the bottom of the perpendicular part of the tube is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VALVE\">valve</a> opening upwards; and near the two extremities, but on the contrary sides of the arms, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> crois part of the tube, are two other valves opening outwards. These two valves are, by the affluence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>, kept shut till the machine is put in motion, when the centrifugal velocity of the water forces them open, and discharges itself into a cistern or reservoir placed there for that purpose.\n\nOn the upper part of the arms are two holes, which are closed by pieces screwing into the metal of the tube. Before the machine can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, these holes must be opened, and water poured in through them, till the whole tube be full: by this means all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be forced out of the machine, and the water supported in the tube by means of the valve at the bottom.\n\nThe tube being thus filled with water, and the holes closed by the screw caps, it is turned round by means of the winch, when the water in the arms of the tube acquires a centrifugal force, opens the valves near the extremities of the arms, and flies out with a velocity nearly equal to that of the extremities of the said arms.\n\nThe above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> will be very easily understood by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> we have added on Plate CXXXVII., which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a> view of the centrifugal machine, erected on board a ship. ABC is the copper tube. D, a horizontal cog-wheel, furnished with twelve cogs. E, a vertical cog-wheel, furnished with thirty-six cogs. F, F, the double winch. A, the valve near the bottom of the tube. B, B, the two pivots on which the machine turns. C, one of the valves in the crois-piece; the other at D, cannot be seen in this figure, being on the other side of the tube. E, E, the two holes through which the water is poured into the machine. GH, the cistern or reservoir. I, I, part of the ship's deck.\n\nThe distance between the two valves, C, D, is six feet. The diameter of these valves is about three inches; and that of the perpendicular tube about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> inches.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> we suppose the men who work the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> can turn the winch round in three seconds, the machine will move round its axis in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>; and consequently each extremity of the arms will move with a velocity of 18.8 feet in a second. Therefore a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of water of three inches diameter will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> through each of the valves with a velocity of 18.8 feet in a second: but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of the aperture of each of the valves is 7.14 inches; which being multiplied by the velocity in inches=225.6, gives 1616.784 cubic inches, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of water discharged through one of the apertures in one second; so that the whole quantity discharged in that space of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> through both the apertures is = 3221.568 inches; or 193294.08 cubic inches Centripetal in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>. But 60812 cubic inches makes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUN\">tun</a>, beer-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>; consequently, if we suppose the centrifugal machine revolves round its axis in one second, it will raise nearly 3 tuns 44 gallons in one minute: but this velocity is certainly too great, at least to be held for any considerable time; so that, when this and other deficiencies in the machine are allowed for, two tuns is nearly the quantity that can be raised by it in one minute.\n\nIt will perhaps be unnecessary to observe, that as the water is forced up the perpendicular tube by the pressure of the atmosphere, this machine cannot raise water above 32 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>.\n\nAn attempt was made to substitute this machine in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of the pumps <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> used on ship-board; but the labour of working was found to be so great as to render the machine inferior to the chain-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>.

Now, every manipulus was allowed two centurions, or captains, one to each order or century: and, to determine the point of priority between them, they were created at two different elections. The 30 who were made first always took the precedence of their fellows; and therefore commanded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> orders, as the others did the left. The triarii,\nCenturipe, or pilani, so called from their weapon the pilum, being esteemed the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a>, had their centurions elected first, next to them the principes, and afterwards the haftati; whence they were called primus et secundus pilus, primus et secundus princeps, primus et secundus haftatus; and so on. Here it may be observed, that primi ordinis is sometimes used in historians for the centuries of these orders; and the centuries are sometimes styled principes ordinum, and principes centurionum.\n\nWe may take notice too what a large field there lay for promotion: first through all the orders of the haftati; then quite through the principes; and afterwards from the last order of the triarii to the primipilus, the most honourable of the centuries, and who deserves to be particularly described. This officer, besides his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of primipilus, went under the several titles of dux legionis, praefectus legionis, primus centurionum, and primus centurio; and was the first centurion of the triarii in every legion. He presided over all the other centuries, and generally gave the word of command by order of the tribunes. Besides this he had the care of the eagle or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> standard of the legion; hence, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AQUILA\">aquila</a> praeficis, is to bear the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of primipilus; and hence aquila is taken by Pliny for the said office. Nor was this station only honourable, but very profitable too: for he had a special stipend allowed him, probably as much as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a>'s estate; and, when he left that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>, was reputed equal to the members of the equitrian order, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the title of primipilarii, in the same manner as those who had discharged the greatest civil offices were styled ever after, consularis, confarrii, &c.\n\nCENTURIP\u00c6, Centuripa, or Centuripe, in Ancient Geography, a town in the south-west of the territory of Etna, on the river Cyamaforus: Now Centorbi, or Centuriippi.

The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> stuffs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a>\nPliny and Solinus are to be credited, were wrought here. Ceos was particularly famous for the excellent figs it produced. It was first peopled by Ariadne, the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYRENE\">Cyrene</a>, who being grieved for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his son Agion, retired from Thebes, at the persuasion of his mother, and went over with some Thebans to Ceos, at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> uninhabited. Diodorus Siculus tells us, that he retired to the island of Cos; but the ancients, as Servius observes, called both these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> by the name of Cos. Be that as it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, the island of Ceos became so populous, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> prevailed there, commanding all persons upwards of sixty to be poisoned, that others might be able to subsist; so that none above sixty were to be seen in the island, being obliged, after they arrived at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, either to submit to the law, or abandon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, together with their effects. Ceos had, in former times, four famous cities, viz. Julis, Carthaea, Corellus, and Prae-ella. The two latter were, according to Pliny, swallowed up by an earthquake. The other two flourished in Strabo's time. Carthaea stood on a rising ground, at the end of a valley, about three miles from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. The situation of it agrees with that of the present town of Zena, which gives name to the whole island. The ruins both of Carthaea and Julis are still remaining; those of the latter take up the whole mountain, and are called by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> inhabitants Polis, that is, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>. Near this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> are the ruins of a flatly temple, with many pieces of broken pillars, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> of most exquisite workmanship. The walls of the city were of marble, and some pieces are still remaining above 12 feet in length.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> marbles tell us, that Simonides, the son of Leopepis, invented a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, the principles of which he explained at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>; and add, that he was defended by another Simonides, who was a poet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less renowned than himself. One of these two poets invented those melancholy verses which were sung at funerals, and are called by the Latins nanie. Strabo says, that the Athenians, having besieged the city of Julis, raised the siege, upon advice that the inhabitants had resolved to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> all the children under a certain age, that useless persons might not be employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> after them.

It was not Ceres alone that was honoured here, but also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACCHUS\">Bacchus</a>. The victims offered were hogs, by reason of the waste they make in the products of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>: whether there was any wine offered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> not, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of much debate among the critics.

Macrobius says, indeed, they did not offer wine to Ceres, but mulsum, which was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of wine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a> boiled up together: that the sacrifice...\nCER\n\nCerealia made on the 21st of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GODDESS\">goddess</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>, was a pregnant sow, together with cakes and mulsum; and that this is what Virgil means by Mili Baccho. The cerealia passed from the Greeks to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, who held them for eight days successively; commencing, as generally held, on the fifth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDES\">ides</a> of April. It was the women alone who were concerned in the celebration, all dressed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>; the men, likewise in white, were only spectators.

See Anatomy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>.\n\nCerebrum, the brain. Its structure and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> are not so fully known as some other parts of the body; and different authors confide it in various manners. However, according to the observations of those most famed for their accuracy and dexterity in anatomical inquiries, its general structure is as given in Anatomy Index.\n\nDr Hunter observes, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> parts of the medullary substance of the brain in idiots and madmen, such as the thalami nervorum opticorum, and medulla oblongata, are found entirely changed from a medullary to a hard, tough, dark-coloured substance, sometimes resembling white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONIAL\">Ceremonial</a> (ceremoniale), a book in which is prescribed the order of the ceremonies to be observed in certain actions and occasions of solemnity and pomp. The ceremonial of the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> is called ordo Romanus. It was published in 1516 by the bishop of Coreyra; at which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> of cardinals were so scandalized, that some of them voted to have the author as well as book burnt, for his temerity in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> the sacred ceremonies to the eyes of profane people.\n\nCeremonial, is also used for the set or system of rules and ceremonies which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> has introduced for regulating our behaviour, and which persons practice towards each other, either out of duty, decency, or civility.\n\nCeremonial, in a more particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, denotes the manner in which princes and ambassadors use to receive and to treat one another. There are endless disputes among sovereigns about the ceremonial; some endeavouring to be on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>, and others to be superior; inasmuch that numerous schemes have been proposed for settling them. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> are, 1. To accommodate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> by compromise or alternation; so that one shall precede now, the other the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; or one in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and the other in another; 2. By seniority; so that an elder <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> in years shall precede a younger, without any other distinction.\n\nThese expedients, however, have not yet been accepted by any, except some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> princes, as they are called, in Germany.\n\nCeremonial is more particularly used in speaking of the laws and regulations given by Moses relating to the worship of God among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Jews. In this sense it amounts to much the same with what is called the Levitical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, and stands contradistinguished from the moral as well as judicial law.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">Ceremony</a>, an assemblage of several actions, forms, and circumstances, serving to render a thing more magnificent and solemn.\n\nIn 1646, M. Ponce published a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of ancient ceremonies, tracing the rise, growth, and introduction of each rite into the church, and its gradual advancement to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> therein. Many of them were borrowed from Judaism; but more seemingly from Paganism. Dr Middleton has given a fine discourse on the conformity between the Pagan and Popish ceremonies, which he exemplifies in the use of incense, holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, lamps, and candles, before the shrines of saints, votive gifts or offerings round the shrines of the deceased, &c. In effect, the altars, images, crosses, processions, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a>, and legends; nay, even the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIERARCHY\">hierarchy</a>, pontificate, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> orders, &c. of the present Romans, he shows, are all copied from their heathen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>.\u2014We have an ample and magnificent account of the religious ceremonies and customs of all nations in the world, represented in figures designed by Picart, with historical explanations, and many curious dissertations.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">Master</a> of the Ceremonies, an officer instituted by King James I. for the more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> reception of ambassadors and strangers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>.

His salary is \u00a3141l. 13s. 4d. per annum.\n\nMarshall of the Ceremonies is their officer, being subordinate to them both.

Pluto having stolen away Proserpine, Ceres travelled all over the world in quest of her daughter, by the help of a torch, which she had lighted in Mount Aetna.\n\nAs Ceres was thus travelling in search of her daughter, she came to Celeus king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELEUSIS\">Eleusis</a>, and undertook to bring up his infant son Triptolemus. Being desirous to render her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> immortal, she fed him in the daytime with divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, and in the night covered him with fire. Celeus observing an unusual improvement in his son, resolved to watch his nurse,\nto which end he hid himself in that part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> where she used to cover the child with fire; but when he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> her put the infant under the embers, he cried out and discovered himself. Ceres punished the curiosity and indiscretion of the father with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. Afterwards she taught the youth the art of sowing corn and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, and mounted him in a chariot drawn by winged dragons, that he might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> the world, and teach mankind the use of corn and fruits. After this, having discovered, by means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NYMPH\">nymph</a> Arethusa, that Proserpine was in the infernal regions, she applied to Jupiter, and obtained from him that Proserpine should be restored, on condition that she had tasted nothing during her stay in that place; but it being discovered, by the information of Ascalaphus, that, as she was walking in Pluto's orchard, she had gathered an apple, and had tasted of some of the seeds, she was forbidden to return. Ceres, out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a>, turned Ascalaphus into an owl. At length, Jupiter, to mitigate her grief, permitted that Proserpine should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> one half of the year in the infernal regions with Pluto, and the other half with her mother on earth.\n\nCicero speaks of a temple of Ceres at Catanae in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, where there was a very ancient statue of that goddess, but entirely concealed from the sight of men, everything being performed by matrons and virgins.","sp":345,"ep":347},{"h":"CERET","t":"a town of France in Roussillon, with a magnificent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> of a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a>.

It was partly to refute this fact that St John wrote his gospel. They received the gospel of St Matthew, to countenance their doctrine of circumcision, form Christ's being circumcised; but they omitted the genealogy.

The proposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> the following year (1787); and notwithstanding the diminution of the bounty, the trade increased; the number of ships employed the same year from England amounting to 217, and the next year (1788) to 222. Their cargoes consisted of 5989 tons of clean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>; 7054 tons of whalebone, beside 13,386 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a> skins.\n\nFor some years British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> has been employed in a southern whale-fishery; and this has also been a very lucrative branch of trade. This fishery was first prosecuted with vigour about the commencement of the American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>. In the year 1785, 18 ships which produced 29,000l. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a> were employed in it. Two years afterwards the number of ships was doubled, and the returns increased in a much greater proportion, which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the flourishing state of the trade. The number of ships in 1787 was 38, and the produce amounted to 107,000l. sterling.\n\nSome American families, when the war broke out in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, emigrated to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-NOVA_SCOTIA\">Nova Scotia</a>, where they proposed to carry on the whale-fishery; but being discouraged from particular circumstances, on the invitation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> Mr Greville, they settled at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILFORD\">Milford</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILFORD_HAVEN\">Milford Haven</a>, and fitted out a ship, which had a very successful voyage. The number of ships soon increased to four, and at present (1803), that number is doubled, so that 18 ships are now employed in the southern whale-fishery from this port, with a capital afloat of not less than 80,000l. sterling. This fact is stated by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARROW\">Barrow</a> in his travels in southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>; and \"I mention it,\" says he, \"as a striking instance to show the importance of the south-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> fishery, and as a proof that, contrary to the generally received <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, it may be carried on by skill and management, and without the adventitious aid of trading, so as fully to answer the purpose of those who are properly qualified to embark in the undertaking. For where men, by industry in their profession, rise from small beginnings into affluence, such profession may be followed with a greater certainty of success than many others which appear to hold out more seducing prospects. The American fishermen never set out with a capital, but invariably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> themselves into one; and the south-sea fishery from England may succeed on the same principle, as the above example clearly shows, under every disadvantage, when properly conducted.\"\n\n\"It is difficult to point out the grounds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> policy in giving tonnage bounties to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENLAND\">Greenland</a> fishery, and only premiums to successful adventurers in the southern fishery. A voyage to Greenland is four months, the outfit of which is covered by the tonnage bounty, and, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> wholly unsuccessful, the same ship can make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> voyage the same year to some of the ports of the Baltic. A voyage to the South sea is from 12 to 18 months, and must depend solely on the success in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a>. A Greenland ship sets out on a small capital, and builds on a quick return; but a south-sea whaler must expend a very considerable capital in making his outfit, for which he can reckon on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> returns for at least 18 months. Hence the usual practice of lending them out in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> capacity of fishers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRABAND\">contraband</a> traders, in order that the losses they may sustain by ill success in fishing may be made good by smuggling.\n\n\"If by extending the fishery we should be enabled to supply the continent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, two objects should never be out of the view of the legislature\u2014the exemption from duty of all the produce of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a>, and particularly spermaceti, which, if manufactured into candles, and subject only to the same duty as tallow candles, would produce much more to the revenue than when taxed as it now is, as wax. I have heard it asserted that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the premium system, by doubling its present amount, which never could exceed 30,000l. a-year, would be adequate encouragement to supply the home market with spermaceti and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> whale oil, and that the bonding of foreign oil in Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> would throw the whole agency of American fishery on England with greater advantage to both countries than by any other system.\n\n\"But when we consider that the home market is necessarily secured to British subjects by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> duties on foreign oil, we should also consider that every means to lessen the charges of outfit should strengthen our adventure in this lucrative branch of trade. Among others that would seem to have this tendency, are the facilities that might be afforded by the happy position of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good Hope. If at this station was established a kind of central depot for the southern whale-fishery, it might, in time, be the means of throwing into our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> exclusively the supply of Europe with spermaceti oil. To the protection of the fisheries on the east and west coasts of southern Africa, the Cape is fully competent, and the fisheries on these coasts would be equally undisturbed in war as in peace. From hence they would, at all times, have an opportunity of acquiring a supply of refreshments for their crews, and of laying in a stock of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> at one-fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the expense of carrying them out from England.\"\n\nThe Dutch were very early engaged in the Greenland whale-fishery, which soon became one of the most important objects of their trade. In 1611 a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> in the was established in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a> for carrying on the whale-fishery on the coasts of Spitzbergen and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol16.html#article-NOVA_ZEMBLA\">Nova Zembla</a>. This branch of trade has in general succeeded better with the Dutch than with any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> reason which has been assigned for this success is the greater economy and frugality of this people, in this as in all their concerns, by which they are able to undersell others in oil and whalebone. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of fitting out all their ships is also mentioned as a cause of their prosperity in this fishery. The ship-builder, the rope-maker, the baker, the brewer, and other tradesmen employed in fitting out these ships, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> take a share in the voyage. When it proves fortunate, they are double gainers; but when it is unsuccessful, the loss which they sustain is probably not greater than if they had merely furnished the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> without having a chance of the profit; and in this respect have the advantage of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>. It is observed by De Witt that this fishery since it fell into the hands of individuals has seldom failed to be profitable; but while it was monopolized by the Dutch Greenland company, the profit was inconsiderable. Some idea may be formed of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> to which the Dutch have carried this trade by stating their fishery.\nthat for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of 46 years preceding the year 1722, 5886 ships were employed in it, and in this period they took 32,907 whales. Each whale at an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a>, valued at \u00a3500, makes the total amount above 16 millions sterling.\n\nThe following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> affords at one view a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> record of the Dutch whale-fishery from 1661 to 1788. The number of ships employed for each year and the number of whales taken are stated in separate columns.\n\n| Year | Ships | Fish |\n|------|-------|------|\n| 1661 | 133   | 452\u00bd |\n| 1662 | 149   | 862   |\n| 1663 | 202   | 932\u00bd |\n| 1664 | 193   | 782   |\n| 1665 | War with England, no ships out. | 1712 |\n| 1666 |       |       |\n| 1667 |       |       |\n| 1668 | 155   | 573   |\n| 1669 | 133   | 1013\u00bd |\n| 1670 | 148   | 792   |\n| 1671 | 138   | 1088\u00bd |\n| 1672 | War with England, no ships out. | 1719 |\n| 1673 |       |       |\n| 1674 |       |       |\n| 1675 | 147   | 900\u00bd |\n| 1676 | 145   | 812\u00bd |\n| 1677 | 145   | 785\u00bd |\n| 1678 | 120   | 1118\u00bd |\n| 1679 | 126   | 792   |\n| 1680 | 151   | 1373  |\n| 1681 | 175   | 876   |\n| 1682 | 195   | 1444  |\n| 1683 | 242   | 1338\u00bd |\n| 1684 | 233   | 1153\u00bd |\n| 1685 | 209   | 1283\u00bd |\n| 1686 | 189   | 664\u00bd |\n| 1687 | 194   | 621\u00bd |\n| 1688 | 214   | 340\u00bd |\n| 1689 | 160   | 241\u00bd |\n| 1690 | 117   | 785   |\n| 1691 | war with France. | 1738 |\n| 1692 | 32    | 56\u00bd  |\n| 1693 | 90    | 175   |\n| 1694 | 63    | 161\u00bd |\n| 1695 | 97    | 187\u00bd |\n| 1696 | 122   | 428   |\n| 1697 | 131   | 1279  |\n| 1698 | 139   | 1483\u00bd |\n| 1699 | 151   | 77\u00bd  |\n| 1700 | 173   | 913\u00bd |\n| 1701 | 208   | 207\u00bd |\n| 1702 | 224   | 687\u00bd |\n| 1703 | 207   | 644   |\n| 1704 | 130   | 632\u00bd |\n| 1705 | 157   | 1678  |\n| 1706 | 151   | 966   |\n| 1707 | 131   | 126   |\n\nThis table is interesting, as it shows us the precarious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of this fishery. But it would have been still more valuable, if some other circumstances had been stated, such as the nature of the seasons when the fishery was less successful; whether the preceding winter was unusually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> or severe; whether the short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> of these regions was not remarkable for extremes or sudden changes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, sudden changes and variations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, the prevalence of particular winds; or other facts which might enable us to trace the causes of the extraordinary failure and success of the fishery.\n\nThe French made an attempt to revive this branch of trade in 1784. Six ships fitted out at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUNKIRK\">Dunkirk</a> at the French expense of the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, made some successful voyages both in the northern and southern whale-fishery. The advantages of the trade were obvious, and the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> were eager to improve them. In the year 1786, some of the inhabitants of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Nantucket, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALIFAX\">Halifax</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, were invited to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> at Dunkirk to carry on the fishery. Several families accepted the invitation, and to encourage them to prosecute the trade, they were permitted to enjoy peculiar privileges and immunities. Ships were sent out to different seas, and had prosperous voyages. But this trade, as well as every other branch of French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, has probably been completely interrupted by the late revolution, and the particular circumstances in which that nation has been with regard to foreign powers.\n\nBesides the nations which we have mentioned, who have been most deeply concerned in this fishery, the inhabitants of other countries have also embarked in it. Some ships were equipped at Embden in 1768 by order of the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a>; the Swedish government in 1774 granted to a company established at Gottenburgh the exclusive privilege of the Davis straits and Greenland fishery for 20 years; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a> in 1775 attempted to take a share in the benefits of that fishery, which many of the nations of Europe, more enterprising or more industrious, had long successfully enjoyed on the shores of the Danish dominions.\n\nThe whale-fishery commences in May. It is about this time that the whales are seen in great numbers the fishery between.\nbetween the 76th and 79th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of north latitude; and at a distance they exhibit the appearance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> rising from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIMNEYS\">chimneys</a> of a great town by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> which is thrown into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> by their spouting or blowing. The fishery continues for the months of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>, when it must be abandoned whether it has been successful or unprofitable; because it is necessary to be clear of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> by the end of August. The ships return home at the earliest in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of September. But if the fishery happen to begin early in May, and prove abundant, they sometimes return in June or July.\n\nWe shall now conclude this article with a short account of the different modes that are practised in taking the whale. The following is employed in the Greenland fishery by Europeans. Every ship is provided with six boats, to each of which belong six men for rowing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>, and a harpooner, whose business it is to strike the whale with his harpoon. Two of these boats are kept constantly on the watch at some distance from the ship, fastened to pieces of ice, and are relieved by others every four hours. As soon as a whale is perceived, both the boats set out in pursuit of it, and if either of them can come up before the whale finally descends, which is known by his throwing up his tail, the harpooner discharges his harpoon at him. There is no difficulty in choosing the place where the whale is to be struck, as some have asserted; for these animals only come up to the surface in order to breathe, or blow, as the fishermen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> it, and therefore always keep the soft and vulnerable part of their bodies above water. A late improvement was made in the method of discharging the harpoon; namely, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> it out of a kind of swivel or musketoon; but it does not appear, that since this improvement was made, the whale-fishing ships have had better success than before.\u2014As soon as the whale is struck, the men set up one of their oars in the middle of the boat as a signal to those in the ship. On perceiving this, the watchman alarms all the rest with the cry of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>! fall! upon which all the other boats are immediately sent out to the assistance of the first.\n\nThe whale finding himself wounded, swims off with prodigious velocity. Sometimes he descends perpendicularly; and sometimes goes off horizontally, at a small depth below the surface. The rope which is fastened to the harpoon is about 200 fathoms long, and properly coiled up, that it may freely be given out as there is a demand for it. At first, the velocity with which this line runs over the side of the boat is so great, that it is wetted to prevent its taking fire: but in a short time the strength of the whale begins to fail, and the fishermen, instead of letting out more rope, strive as much as possible to pull back what is given out already, though they always find themselves necessitated to yield at last to the efforts of the animal, to prevent his sinking their boat. If he runs out the 200 fathoms of line contained in one boat, that belonging to another is immediately fastened to the end of the first, and so on; and there have been instances, where all the rope belonging to the six boats has been necessary, though half that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> is seldom required. The whale cannot stay long below water, but again comes up to blow; and being now much fatigued and wounded, stays longer above water than usual. This gives another boat time to come up with him, and he is again struck with a harpoon. He again descends, but with less force than before; and when he comes up again, is generally incapable of descending, but suffers himself to be wounded and killed with long lances which the men are provided with for that purpose. He is known to be near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> when he spouts up the water deeply tinged with blood.\n\nThe whale being dead, is lashed alongside the ship. They then lay it on one side, and put two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a>, one at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, and the other in the place of the tail, which, together with the fins, is struck off as soon as he is taken, to keep these extremities above water. On the off-side of the whale are two boats, to receive the pieces of fat, utensils, and men, that might otherwise fall into the water on that side. These precautions being taken, three or four men with irons at their feet to prevent slipping, get on the whale, and begin to cut out pieces of about three feet thick and eight long, which are hauled up at the capstan or windlass. When the fat is all got off, they cut off the whalebone of the upper jaw with an axe. Before they cut, they are all lashed to keep them firm; which also facilitates the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a>, and prevents them from falling into the sea; when on board, five or six of them are bundled together, and properly flowed; and after all is got off, the carcass is turned adrift, and devoured by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> bears, who are very fond of it. In proportion as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> pieces of fat are cut off, the rest of the crew are employed in slicing them smaller, and picking out all the lean. When this is prepared, they throw it under the deck, where it lies till the fat of all the whales taken during the fishery is on board; then cutting it still smaller, they put it up in tubs in the hold, cramming them full and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>. At the end of the season they return home, where the fat is boiled and pressed to give out the oil.\n\nBut a different method is practised by the rude inhabitants of the different nations on the coasts of the frozen ocean. On some parts of the sea coasts of Kamtchatka, the return of the fishing season is celebrated with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> festival and great rejoicings in their subterranean winter habitations, in which many superstitious ceremonies are performed. In one part of the ceremonies dogs are sacrificed, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> of drums and other rude musical instruments. The priests who attend and conduct the festival, transport with great solemnity and pomp a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of a whale, made of wood, from the summer habitation to the winter cottage. As the ceremonies proceed, the whole company assembled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOUT\">shout</a> with a great noise, that the whale has made its escape from the cottage to the sea; and they pretend even to throw the traces of the whale in its course, as if it had really made its way through the opening in the cottage. These ceremonies being ended, the men prepare their nets, and embark in their canoes. The nets are set at the openings of bays, where fish, which are the food of the whale, are abundant, and in the pursuit of which entering the bays he is taken. When this is observed by the people in the canoes, they approach and secure their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> with ropes and traps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>. This event is again celebrated by their wives and children on shore with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a>, singing, and other demonstrations of joy. But after the whale is sufficiently secured, he is not brought on shore.\nshore till another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> is performed. They put on their best clothes, and, with similar solemnity, transport the image of the whale in wood from the winter to a new summer habitation. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a> is there lighted up, and an attendant is appointed to watch and keep it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> to the autumn. The whale is then cut up, and furnishes for a long time what is considered by the natives of those regions a very delicate food.\n\nAmong the Kurile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, which are situated near the southern extremity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> of Kamtchatka, the whales are most abundant about the beginning of autumn. At that time the inhabitants embark in their canoes, and search for them in places where they generally find them asleep on the surface of the water. When they are so fortunate as to find one in this situation, they approach with the least possible noise; and, when they have come within the proper distance, they pierce him with poisoned arrows. And although these wounds seem extremely slight, they are said in a short time to occasion great pain. The whale thus wounded, moves about furiously, blows with great violence, and soon dies.\n\nWe have already mentioned the mode of taking the whale which is practised by the Icelanders, in giving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-BALENA\">balena</a> glacialis*, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ICELAND\">Iceland</a> whale. It is according to Anderson, by throwing blood into the sea, when they get between the whale and the shore. They then endeavour to drive him towards the shore; but the whale finding himself pursued, attempts to regain the ocean, and approaching the blood, is alarmed; and rather than swim across it, returns towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, where he is often thrown on shore. But this is contradicted by Horrebow, who says, that the usual method of killing the whale in Iceland, is with the harpoon.\n\nWhen the whale returns to the coasts of Greenland, the fishermen put on their large skin coats, and furnish themselves with a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> to sharpen it. They provide also harpoons, spears, and arrows, with a number of large skins of the sea dog inflated. Thus equipped, they launch their canoes, and embark with their wives and children. The harpoon which they generally employ, is pointed with bone, or a sharp stone. Some indeed have harpoons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, which they procure from the Danes by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARTER\">barter</a> for the oil or fat of the whale. The scarcity of wood and iron makes these articles extremely valuable to Greenlanders, and has excited their ingenuity to avoid the risk of losing them. For this purpose an inflated bladder of the skin of the sea-dog is attached to the harpoon, so that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> it should not reach the whale when they attempt to strike, it may float on the water, and be recovered. Thus equipped, they launch out into the ocean in their small canoes, and, with great intrepidity attack the largest whales. They approach them, says Anderson, with astonishing boldness, and endeavour to fix, by means of their harpoon, which they throw at his body, some of the skins inflated with air. For notwithstanding the enormous bulk of this animal, two or three of these skins, by the resistance which they make to the water, on account of their diminished specific gravity, greatly impede his attempts at plunging into the deep. Having by this means succeeded in arresting his progress, they approach nearer, and, with their lances, pierce his body, till he become languid and feeble with the loss of blood, and at last dies. The fishermen then plunge into the sea with their skin-jackets filled with air, and swim to their prize; and, floating on the surface of the water, they cut off with their knives from every part of the whale the fat or blubber, which is thrown into the canoes. And, notwithstanding the rudeness and imperfection of their instruments, their dexterity is such, that they can extract from the mouth the greatest, or at least the best part of the whalebone.\n\nBut the mode of killing the whale, the boldest and most astonishing, is that which is practised by the Indians on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLORIDA\">Florida</a>. When a whale appears, the Indians fasten to their bodies two pieces of wood and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALLET\">mallet</a>; and these instruments, with their canoe, constitute the whole of their fishing equipage. When they approach the whale, they throw themselves into the water, swim directly towards him, and have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> to get upon his neck, taking care to avoid the stroke of his fins or tail. When the whale first spouts, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> introduces one of the pieces of wood into the opening of one of the blow-holes, and drives it home with the mallet. The whale thus attacked, instantly plunges, and carries the Indian along with him, who keeps fast hold of the animal. The whale, which has now only one blow-hole, soon returns to the surface of the water, to respire; and, if the Indian succeeds in fixing the other piece of wood into the second blow-hole, the whale again descends to the bottom, but a moment after re-appears on the surface, where he remains motionless, and immediately expires by the interruption of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of respiration.","sp":377,"ep":380},{"h":"CETUS","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a>, the whale; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> constellation of the southern hemisphere, under Piscis, and next the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AQUARIUS\">Aquarius</a>.

It is situated at the entrance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a>, by which it is bounded on the north. On the north-west it is separated from the Coromandel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> of Mannar, a narrow strait full of shoals, and impassable by large ships; and is distant about 60 leagues from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> Comorin, the southern point of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>. Its circumference is computed to be about 900 miles; and its length from Point Pedro at the northern extremity to Donderhead at the southern is about 300 miles. Its breadth is very unequal, being in some parts only from 40 to 50 miles, while in others it extends to 60, 70, and even 100.\n\nThe appearance of the eastern coast is bald and rocky, and a few reefs of rocks run out into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> on the south-east between Point de Galle and Batacoco. The deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> on the eastern shores admits the approach of the largest vessels in safety; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> that side of the island be the least fertile, its other defects are amply compensated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a> of Trincomalee and Batacoco. The north and north-west coast from Point Pedro to Columbo is flat, and everywhere indented with inlets of the sea. The largest of them extends almost quite across the island from Mullipattai to Jafnapatam on the north-west point of the island; and forms the peninsula of Jafnapatam. Several of these inlets form small harbours.\n\nThe interior of the island abounds with steep and lofty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, covered with thick forests, and full\nof almost impenetrable jungles. The woods and mountains completely surround the dominions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDY\">Candy</a>, and seem destined by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> to defend him against those foreign enemies, whose superior skill and power have deprived him of the open tracts on the seacoast. The most lofty range of mountains divides the island nearly into two parts, and so completely separates them from each other, that both the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> and seasons on either side are essentially different. These mountains also obstruct completely the effect of the monsoons, which set in periodically from opposite sides of them; so that not only the opposite sea-coast, but the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> in the interior suffers very little from these storms.\n\nThe monsoons in Ceylon are connected with those on the Coromandel and Malabar coasts; but they set in much sooner on the western than the eastern side of the island. On the west side, where Columbo lies, the rains prevail in the months of May, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>, the season when they are felt on the Malabar coast. This monsoon is usually extremely violent, being accompanied with dreadful storms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>, together with vast torrents of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, and violent south-west winds. During its continuance, the northern parts of the island are very little affected, and are even generally dry. In the months of October and November, when the opposite monsoon sets in on the Coromandel coast, it is the north of Ceylon which is affected, and scarcely any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of it is felt in the southern parts.\n\nThese monsoons <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> slightly over the interior, and seldom occasion any considerable inconvenience. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the island is not altogether freed from the dreadful storms which so terribly ravage the tropical climates. During its own periodical season, which happens in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> and April, the rain pours <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in torrents, and the thunder and lightning are terrible.\n\nFrom the situation of this island, so near the equator, the days and nights are nearly of equal length; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> during the two seasons not exceeding 15 minutes. The seasons are more regulated by the monsoons than the course of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>; for although the island lies to the north of the line, the coolest season is during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> solstice, while the western monsoon prevails. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> commences in October, and the hottest season is from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> to the beginning of April. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, is nearly the same throughout the whole year; the rainy season, however, renders the nights much cooler, from the dampness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and the prevalence of winds during the monsoons. The climate, upon the whole, is much more temperate than on the continent of India. This temperate climate, however, is chiefly confined to the coast where the sea breezes have room to circulate. In the interior of the country, owing to the thick and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> woods, and the hills which crowd upon each other, the heat is many degrees greater than on the sea coast, and the climate often extremely sultry and unhealthy.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> harbours in the island for large ships, are Trincomalee and Point de Galle; they also come to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCHOR\">anchor</a>, and at certain seasons of the year moor securely, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> of Columbo. There are several other inferior ports round the island, which afford shelter to the smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COASTING\">coasting</a> vessels.\n\nThe two principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> are the Malivagonga and Mulivaddy. The former takes its rise among the hills to the south-east of Candy, and nearly surrounds that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>. After a variety of circuitous windings among the mountains, it at last discharges itself into the sea at Trincomalee. This river is so deep as to be fordable only towards the source; but the rocks, which everywhere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> its course, prevent it from being navigated. The Mulivaddy rises from the foot of a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> mountain, known to Europeans by the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a>'s Peak, and situated about sixty miles to the north-east of Columbo. This river falls into the sea by several branches: the largest of these empties itself about three miles from the fort of Columbo, after having nearly surrounded a large tract of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> country, of which it forms a peninsula.\n\nBesides the rivers with which Ceylon abounds, there are many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> with them, particularly in the neighbourhood of Columbo and Nigumbo. They are often of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, and of great utility to the inhabitants in their neighbourhood, who have thus an opportunity of readily transporting their several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of trade; and it is by this means also that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> on the coast are supplied with the greatest abundance of fresh-water fish.\n\nThe internal communications by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> through the island have scarcely passed the first stage of improvement. Along the sea-coasts indeed there are roads and stations for travellers; but these roads are in many places rugged and steep.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> in general, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a>, with a small mixture of clay. In the south-west parts, particularly about Columbo, there is a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of marshy ground, very rich and productive. This tract, however, is chiefly occupied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CINNAMON\">cinnamon</a> plantations, and the rest of the island, in its present state of cultivation, does not produce a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a> for the consumption of its inhabitants.\n\nCeylon was originally divided into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of distinct petty kingdoms, separated by the several rivers and mountains which are dispersed over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the island, and subject each to its own independent sovereign. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, however, the whole country was reduced under the dominion of the king of Candy, and divided by him into a few great provinces, from which several of the numerous titles he still retains were derived. These provinces were Candy, Coitu, Matura, Dambadar, and Sittivacca, which included the rich districts on the west coast. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of these provinces was Candy, situated in the centre of the island, and honoured with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> residence. The king holds his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> there to this day; and though all the other provinces have been more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> less encroached upon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> part of Candy has ever been reduced to permanent subjection under a foreign power. The great divisions of the island now are reduced to two; the one comprehending those parts under the dominion of Europeans, and the other those which still remain to the natives.\n\nLittle was known of the island of Ceylon previous to the arrival of the Portuguese in 1505, who were admitted by the king of the country in a friendly manner, and received from him an annual tribute for their protection against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> invasion, particularly against the attacks of the Arabs, who had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> harassed and oppressed\noppressed the Ceylonese. The inhabitants at that time, as at present, consisted of two distinct races, the Bedahs, who lived in the forests, particularly in the northern parts, and the Cingalese, who inhabited the sea coast. Columbo, now the European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of Ceylon, was at that time the royal residence. Cinnamon was even then the chief product and staple commodity of the country. Two hundred and fifty thousand pounds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> were annually delivered by the king to the Portuguese in name of tribute. The inhabitants suffered great cruelties and oppressions under the Portuguese, and were glad of an opportunity of throwing off the yoke and putting themselves under the protection of the Dutch. In 1632, a strong armament was sent out by the latter to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> with the native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>; and, after a bloody struggle, the Portuguese were at last expelled from the island. Columbo surrendered to the Dutch arms in 1656, and this terminated the dominion of the Portuguese in the island. In the year 1795, a body of British troops was sent for the conquest of Ceylon, and after various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> operations, this valuable possession was added to the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>.\n\nThe chief towns in Ceylon are Trincomalee and Columbo. Trincomalee lies in latitude 8\u00b0 30\u2032. It runs in a north-east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> along one branch of the bay. The country around it is mountainous and woody; the soil uncultivated and rather barren, and the whole appearance wild.\n\nTrincomalee, from its situation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, is naturally strong. It occupies more ground than Columbo, but contains a much smaller number of houses, and those inferior in size and appearance to those which are to be met with in several towns on the south-west coast. The circumference of Trincomalee, within the walls, is about three miles: within this space is also included a hill or rising point, immediately over the sea, and covered with brushwood.\n\nThe fort is strong, and commands the principal bays; and, in particular, the entrance into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> harbour, or inner bay, which affords at all seasons, and in every variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, a secure shelter to ships of all descriptions, being land-locked on all sides, and sufficiently deep and capacious to receive any number of the largest vessels.\n\nThis harbour, from its nature and situation, is that which stamps Ceylon one of our most valuable acquisitions in the East Indies. As soon as the violent monsoons commence, every vessel which is caught by them in any other part of the bay of Bengal, is obliged immediately to put to sea to prevent inevitable destruction. At these seasons Trincomalee and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-BOMBAY\">Bombay</a> alone, of all the ports on the different coasts of the peninsula of India, are capable of affording a safe retreat. The incalculable advantages to be derived from such a harbour, are increased by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROXIMITY\">proximity</a> and easy access to our settlements in the bay of Bengal.\n\nColumbo is the capital of Ceylon and the seat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. Although Trincomalee, on account of its situation and harbour, be of more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> to retain, yet Columbo in every other respect is greatly superior. The number of its inhabitants is much greater; its fort and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> town are much larger; the country where it is situated is far more fertile, and the rich district depending upon it much wider, being not less than 20 leagues in length, and 10 in breadth. It is situated in the west, or rather towards the south-west part of the island, in about 7\u00b0 north latitude, and 78\u00b0 east longitude from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of Columbo is regular. It is nearly divided into four equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> by two principal streets, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> each other, and extend the whole length of the town. To these, smaller ones run <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a>, with connecting lanes between them. At the foot of the ramparts on the inside is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> street or way, which goes round the whole fort, and communicates with the bastions and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>' <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRACKS\">barracks</a>; and also affords, at the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, open spaces for their private parading.\n\nBeside the European inhabitants of Ceylon, the natives are quite distinct from each other in manners and civilization. The Cingalese, who inhabit the low lands and parts contiguous to the coasts, live entirely under the dominion of whatever European nation has been able to acquire possession of that part of the island. The nature of the country they inhabit indeed leaves them hardly any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> but unconditional submission, unless they could either meet the Europeans in open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, or consent to quit their plentiful fields for the barren mountains of the interior.\n\nThey are a quiet, inoffensive people; exceedingly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>, temperate, and frugal. Their bodies partake of the indolence of their minds, and it is with reluctance they are roused to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> exertion. When, however, they are obliged to apply themselves to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, they are capable of undergoing a great deal of labour.\n\nThe milder virtues form the most prominent features of the Cingalese character. They are gentle, charitable, and friendly, and have scarcely any of the false, treacherous, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGNING\">designing</a> arts which are often found among the Candians. With much less smoothness and courtliness of face and manner than the latter, they have much sincerer hearts. On examining the countenances and carriage of these two classes of Ceylonese, it is easy to perceive the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> arising from the respective circumstances in which they are placed. The countenance of the Candian is erect, his look haughty, his mien lofty, and his whole carriage marked by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> of independence.\n\nThe looks of the Cingalese even denote a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of effeminacy and cowardice, which excites the contempt of the Candians; although the latter, with all their boasted spirit, can never venture to attack an European but by the same method as the Cingalese, and are equally cautious in waiting the convenient moment of afflicting him from the bushes, in which they have concealed themselves.\n\nThe most singular part of the inhabitants of Ceylon are the Bedahs, or Vaddahs. The origin of the Bedahs or Vaddahs, who inhabit the deepest recesses of the Ceylonese forests, has never been traced, as no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> can be found in the eastern world which corresponds with them. Conjecture has, indeed, been busy on the occasion, as it usually is where real information is wanting. The Bedahs are generally supposed to have been the aboriginal inhabitants of the island, who, upon being overwhelmed by their Cingalese invaders, preferred the independence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> to a tame submission. A current <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>, however,\nCeylon ever affixes them a different origin. It is related that they were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> away on the island, and chose to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> there; but refusing, upon a certain occasion, to assist the king in his wars against some foreign enemies, they were driven out from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of the natives, and forced to take up their abode in the most unfrequented forests. Some imagine that the Bedahs are merely a part of the native Cadians, who chose to retain their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> savage freedom, when their brethren of the plains and valleys submitted to the cultivation of the earth, and the restraints of society. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> rests entirely on those Bedahs, who are most known, speaking a broken dialect of the Cingalese. It is, however, by no means ascertained that this is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of the Bedahs; nor is any account of their origin supported by the slightest shadow of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>.\n\nAmong the animals of Ceylon, and at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the class of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a>, is the elephant, which is considered as superior to those found in any other part of the world. The oxen are of very small size, scarcely exceeding that of calves of a year old. They are of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> which have the hump on the shoulder; but are inferior in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, as well as in size, to any found on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> continent. The beef is sometimes of a good quality, and forms the chief food of the European soldiers. Buffaloes are found in great numbers in the island, both in a wild and tame state. They are wild and untractable; and even when tamed and trained to the draught, for which, being stronger and larger than the oxen, they are well adapted, they retain a good deal of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> manners. A variety of deer and elks are found in Ceylon; especially the gazelle, a very small species, about the size of our hare, which is caught by the natives and brought to market in cages, where they are sold for about 1s. piece. Hares, similar to the European, abound in every part of the island; a small species of tyger, the tyger cat, the leopard, the jackal, porcupines, raccoons, squirrels, and sometimes, but rarely, the hyena and the bear, are found in Ceylon. Birds, insects, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a>, and other reptiles, such as are usually to be met with in the larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> of the Indian ocean, or on the neighbouring continent, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in this island.\n\nCeylon abounds in all the vegetables and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> which are found within the tropical regions. But among the vegetable productions of Ceylon, the most valuable, and what may be reckoned the staple commodity of the island, is the cinnamon.\n\nThe principal woods, or gardens, as they are called, where the cinnamon is procured, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in the neighbourhood of Columbo. The grand garden near the town is so extensive as to occupy a tract of country from 10 to 15 miles in length, and stretching along from the north-east to the south of the district. Nature has here concentrated both the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> of the island. Nothing can be more delightful to the eye than the prospect which stretches around Columbo. The low cinnamon trees which cover the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> allow the view to reach the groves of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-EVERGREENS\">evergreens</a>, interspersed with tall clumps, and bounded everywhere with extensive ranges of cocoa-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> and other large trees. The whole is diversified with small lakes and green marshes, skirted all around with rice and pasture fields. In one part the intertwining cinnamon trees appear completely to clothe the face of the plain; in another, the openings made by the intersecting footpaths <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> serve to show that the thick underwood has been penetrated.\n\nThe soil best adapted for the growth of the cinnamon is a loose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>. Such is the soil of the cinnamon gardens around Columbo, as well as in many parts around Nigumbo and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALCUTTA\">Calcutta</a>, where this spice is found of the same superior quality. Of late years little is procured from the interior; and what is brought thence is coarser and thicker in the appearance, and of a hot pungent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>.\n\nAs this spice constitutes the wealth of Ceylon, great pains are taken to ascertain its quality, and to propagate the choicest kinds. The prime sort, and that which grows in the gardens around Columbo, is procured from the *laurea cinnamomum*. This is a tree of a small size, from four to ten feet in height: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> is slender, and like several of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>, a number of branches and twigs shoot out from it on every side. The wood is soft, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, and porous, in appearance much resembling that of our oifer; and when barked it is chiefly fit for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>, to which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> converted. It is, however, sometimes sawed into planks, and manufactured into caddies and other pieces of furniture; but its scent does not secure it from the attacks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>.\n\nThe cinnamon tree produces a species of fruit resembling an acorn, but not so large, which ripens about the latter end of autumn, and is gathered by the natives for the purpose of extracting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>. The process they employ is to bruise the fruit, boil it, and skim off the oil: this they use for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> and body on great occasions, and also for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> in their lamps. When mixed with cocoa-nut oil, it gives extremely good light. The kings of Candy use it for this purpose, and formerly commanded their subjects to bring them a certain quantity as a yearly tribute. When any ambassadors are sent to these princes, they always burn this oil during the time of audience.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEARL\">pearl</a>-fishery in the bay of Condatchy, during the season, exhibits one of the most interesting scenes in Ceylon. The banks, where it is carried on, extend several miles along the coast from Manar southward, off Arippo, Condatchy, and Pomparipo. The principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> is opposite to Condatchy, and lies out at sea about 20 miles. The first step, previous to the commencement of the fishery, is to have the different oyster banks surveyed, the state of the oysters ascertained, and a report made on the subject to government. If it has been found that the quantity is sufficient, and that they are arrived at a proper degree of maturity, the particular banks to be fished that year are put up for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> to the highest bidder, and are usually purchased by a black merchant. Government sometimes judges it more advantageous to fish the banks on its own account, and to dispose of the pearls afterwards to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>. When this plan is adopted, boats are hired for the season on account of government, from different quarters; the price varies considerably, according to circumstances; but is usually from 500 to 800 pagodas for each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>.\n\nAs neither the season, nor the convenience of the persons attending, would permit the whole of the banks to be fished in one year, they are divided into three or four different portions, which are fished one portion annually in succession. The different portions are completely distinct, and are set up separately to sale, each...\nCeylon each in the year in which it is to be fished. By this means a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> is given to the oysters to attain their proper growth; and as the portion first used has generally recovered its maturity by the time the last portion has been fished, the fishery becomes almost regularly annual, and may thus be considered as yielding a yearly revenue. The oysters are supposed to attain their complete state of maturity in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years; for, if left too long, it is said that the pearl becomes so large and inconvenient to the fish, that it throws it out of the shell.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> season commences in February, and ends about the beginning of April. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> allowed to the merchant to fish the banks is six weeks, or two months at the utmost; but there are several interruptions, which prevent the fishing days from exceeding more than about thirty. If it happens to be a very bad season, and many stormy days intervene during the period allotted, the purchaser of the fishery is often allowed a few days more as a favour.\n\nDuring the season, all the boats regularly fail and return together. A signal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUN\">gun</a> is fired at Arippo, about ten o'clock at night, when the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> sets sail with the land breeze. They reach the banks before daybreak; and at sunrise commence fishing. In this they continue busily occupied till the sea breeze, which arises about noon, warns them to return to the bay. As soon as they appear within sight, another gun is fired, and the colours hoisted, to inform the anxious owners of their return. When the boats come to land, their cargoes are immediately taken out, as it is necessary to have them completely unloaded before night. Whatever may have been the success of their boats, the owners seldom wear the looks of disappointment; for, although they may have been unsuccessful one day, they look with the most complete assurance of better fortune to the next; as the Brahmins and conjurers, whom they implicitly trust in defiance of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, understand too well the liberality of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> in hopes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a>, not to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> them all they can desire.\n\nEach of the boats carries 20 men, with a tindal or chief boatman, who acts as pilot. Ten of the men row and assist the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> in ascending. The other ten are divers; they go down into the sea by five at a time; when the first five come up the other five go down, and by this method of alternately <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVING\">diving</a>, they give each other time to recruit themselves for a fresh plunge.\n\nIn order to accelerate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of the divers, large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> are employed: five of these are brought in each boat for the purpose; they are of a reddish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a>, common in this country, and of a pyramidal shape, round at top and bottom, with a hole perforated through the smaller end sufficient to admit a rope. Some of the divers use a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> shaped like a half-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, which they fasten round the belly when they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> to descend, and thus keep their feet free.\n\nThese people are accustomed to dive from their very infancy, and fearlessly descend to the bottom in from four to ten fathom water, in search of the oysters. The diver, when he is about to plunge, seizes the rope, to which one of the stones we have described is attached, with the toes of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> foot, while he takes hold of a bag of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>-work with those of his left; it being customary among all the Indians to use their toes in working or holding as well as their fingers, and such is the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> that they can pick up even the smallest thing from the ground with their toes as nimbly as an European could do with his fingers. The diver thus prepared, seizes another rope with his right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and holding his nostrils shut with the left, plunges into the water, and by the affluence of the stone speedily reaches the bottom. He then hangs the net round his neck, and with much dexterity, and all possible dispatch, collects as many oysters as he can while he is able to remain under water, which is usually about two minutes. He then resumes his former position, makes a signal to those above by pulling the rope in his right hand, and is immediately by this means drawn up and brought into the boat, leaving the stone to be pulled up afterwards by the rope attached to it.\n\nThe exertion undergone during this process is so violent, that upon being brought into the boat, the divers discharge water from their mouth, ears, and nostrils, and frequently even blood. But this does not hinder them from going down again in their turn. They <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> often make from 40 to 50 plunges in one day; and at each plunge bring up about 100 oysters. Some rub their bodies over with oil, and stuff their ears and noses to prevent the water from entering; while others use no precautions whatever. Although the usual time of remaining under water does not much exceed two minutes, yet there are instances known of divers who could remain four and even five minutes. The longest instance ever known was that of a diver who came from Anjongo in 1797, and who absolutely remained under water full five minutes.\n\nThe boat-owners and merchants are very apt to lose many of the best pearls while the boats are on their return to the bay from the banks, as the oysters when alive and left for some time undisturbed frequently open their shells of their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a>: a pearl may then be easily discovered, and the oyster prevented by means of a bit of grass or soft wood from again closing its shell, till an opportunity offers of picking out the pearl. Those fellows who are employed to search among the fish also commit many depredations, and even swallow the pearls to conceal them; when this is suspected, the plan followed by the merchants is to lock the fellows up, and give them strong emetics and purgatives, which have frequently the effect of discovering the stolen goods.\n\nAs soon as the oysters are taken out of the boats, they are carried by the different people to whom they belong and placed in holes or pits dug in the ground to the depth of about two feet, or in small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> places cleared and fenced round for the purpose; each person having his own separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>. Mats are spread below them to prevent the oysters from touching the earth; and here they are left to die and rot. As soon as they have passed through a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>, and have become dry, they are easily opened without any danger of injuring the pearls, which might be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> if they were opened fresh, as at that time to do so requires great force. On the shell being opened, the oyster is minutely examined for the pearls: it is usual even to boil the oyster, as the pearl, though commonly found in the shell, is not unfrequently contained in the body of the fish itself.\n\nThe pearls found at this fishery are of a whiter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> than those got in the gulf of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORMUS\">Ormus</a> on the Arabian...\nCeylonian coast, but in other respects are not accounted so pure or of such an excellent quality; for though the white pearls are more esteemed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, the natives prefer those of a yellowish or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> cast. Off Tutu-coreen, which lies, on the Coromandel coast, nearly opposite to Condatchy, there is another fishery; but the pearls found there are much inferior to the two species now mentioned, being tainted with a blue or grayish tinge.\n\nIn preparing the pearls, particularly in drilling and stringing them, the black people are wonderfully expert. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> they employ in drilling, is a machine made of wood, and of a shape resembling an obtuse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a> cone, about six inches in length, and four inches in breadth, which is supported upon three feet, each inch long. In the upper flat surface of this machine, holes or pits are formed to receive the larger pearls, the smaller ones being beaten in with a little wooden hammer. The drilling instruments are spindles of various sizes according to that of the pearls; they are turned round in a wooden head by means of a bow handle to which they are attached. The pearls being placed in the pits which we have already mentioned, and the point of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINDLE\">spindle</a> adjusted to them, the workman presses on the wooden head of the machine with his left hand, while his right is employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> round the bow handle. During the process of drilling, he occasionally moistens the pearl by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIPPING\">dipping</a> the little finger of his right hand in a cocoa-nut filled with water which is placed by him for that purpose; this he does with a dexterity and quickness which scarcely impedes the operation, and can only be acquired by much practice.\n\nThey have also a variety of other instruments, both for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> and drilling the pearls. To clean, round, and polish them to that state in which we see them, a powder made of the pearls themselves is employed. These different operations in preparing the pearls occupy a great number of the black men in various parts of the island. In the black town of Columbo, in particular, many of them may every day be seen at this work.\n\nPutallom is remarkable for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>-pans. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> before the arrival of Europeans on the island, supplied the natives with salt; and on account of its convenient situation, was pitched upon by the Dutch for manufacturing the salt with which they supplied the king of Candy's dominions, according to the articles of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> with him. The salt-pans are formed by an arm of the sea which overflows part of the country between Putallom and Calpenteen. A very large quantity of salt was manufactured here by the Dutch; they looked upon it as of the highest importance to their interests in the island, and the most formidable weapon which it was in their power to employ against the native king, as it was impossible for him to procure any but through their means. The Dutch enacted severe laws to prevent individuals from manufacturing or trading in this article, the government taking upon itself the management of the works and the care of supplying both its own subjects and the Candians. In order to keep a constant check on the latter, the Dutch were careful not to allow them too great a quantity at once; and whatever remained at Putallom after supplying the demands of each year they destroyed, that it might not be seized upon by surprise. But this manufacture has been greatly neglected, it is said, since the island came into the possession of the British.\n\nCHACE.

This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> was considered by Philip as well adapted to the operations of the Macedonian phalanx; and the ground for his encampment, and afterwards the field of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, were chosen with equal sagacity; having in view on one side a temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>, whom the Macedonians regarded as the author of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> protector of their fortune; and on the other the banks of the Thermodon, a small river flowing into the Cephissus, announced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORACLES\">oracles</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> as the destined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of desolation and woe to their unhappy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. The generals of the confederate Greeks had been much less careful to avail themselves of the powerful sanctions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>. Unrestrained by inauspicious sacrifices, the Athenians had left the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> at the exhortation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMOSTHENES\">Demosthenes</a>, to wait <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OMEN\">omen</a> but the cause of their country. Regardless of oracles, they afterwards advanced to the ill-fated Thermodon, accompanied by the Thebans, and the scanty reinforcements raised by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PELOPONNESUS\">Peloponnesus</a> which had joined their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a>. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> amounted to 30,000 men, animated by the noblest cause for which men can fight, but commanded by the Athenians <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LYCURGUS\">Lycurgus</a> and Charax; the first but little, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> unfavourably known; and by Theagenes the Theban, a person strongly suspected of treachery: all three creatures of cabal and tools of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a>, slaves of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> or voluptuousness, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> (especially as they had been appointed to command the only states whose shame, rather than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, yet opposed the public enemy) are alone sufficient to prove that Greece was ripe for ruin.\n\nWhen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> approached for abolishing the tottering independence of those turbulent republics, which their own internal vices, and the arms and intrigues of Philip,\nCh\u00e6ronea. Philip, had been gradually undermining for 22 years, both armies formed in battle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARRAY\">array</a> before the rising of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> wing of the Macedonians was headed by Philip, who judged proper to oppose in person the dangerous fury of the Athenians. His son Alexander, only 19 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, but surrounded by experienced officers, commanded the left wing, which faced the Sacred Band of the Thebans. The auxiliaries of either army were posted in the centre. In the beginning of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, the Athenians <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with impetuosity, and repelled the opposing divisions of the enemy; but the youthful ardour of Alexander obliged the Thebans to retire, the Sacred Band being cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>. The young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> completed their disorder, by pursuing the scattered multitude with his Thessalian cavalry.\n\nMeantime the Athenian generals, too much elated with their first advantage, lost the opportunity to improve it; for having repelled the centre and right wing of the Macedonians, except the phalanx, which was composed of chosen men, and immediately commanded by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, they, instead of attempting to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> this formidable body by attacking it in flank, pressed forward against the fugitives, the insolent Lyceids exclaiming in vain triumph, \"Pursue, my brave countrymen! let us drive the cowards to Macedon.\" Philip observed this rash folly with contempt; and saying to those around him, \"Our enemies know not how to conquer,\" commanded his phalanx, by a rapid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVOLUTION\">evolution</a>, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> an adjacent eminence, from which they poured down, firm and collected, on the advancing Athenians, whose confidence of success had rendered them totally insensible to danger. But the irresistible shock of the Macedonian spear converted their fury into despair. Above a thousand fell, two thousand were taken prisoners; the rest escaped by a precipitate and shameful flight. Of the Thebans more were killed than taken. Few of the confederates perished, as they had little share in the action, and as Philip, perceiving his victory to be complete, gave orders to spare the vanquished, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLEMENCY\">clemency</a> unusual in that age, and not less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> to his understanding than his heart; since his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> thus subdued the minds, and gained the affections of his conquered enemies.\n\nAccording to the Grecian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, the battle was followed by an entertainment; at which the king presiding in person, received the congratulations of his friends, and the humble supplications of the Athenian deputies, who craved the bodies of their slain. Their request, which served as an acknowledgment of their defeat, was readily granted; but before they availed themselves of the permission to carry off their dead, Philip, who with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> intemperance had protracted the entertainment till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, issued forth with his licentious companions to visit the field of battle; their heads crowned with festive garlands, their minds intoxicated with the influence of wine and victory; yet the sight of the slaughtered Thebans, which first presented itself to their eyes, and particularly the sacred band of friends and lovers, who lay covered with honourable wounds on the spot where they had been drawn up to fight, brought back these insolent spectators to the sentiments of reason and humanity. Philip beheld the awful scene with a mixture of admiration and pity; and, after an affecting silence, denounced a solemn curse against those who basely suspected the Ch\u00e6ronea friendship of such brave men to be tainted with criminal and infamous passions.\n\nBut this serious temper of mind did not last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>; for having proceeded to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the field where the Athenians had fought and fallen, the king abandoned himself to all the levity and littleness of the most petulant joy. Instead of being impressed with a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of his recent danger, and with dutiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">Heaven</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of his escape, and the importance of his victory, Philip only compared the boastful pretensions with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> performances of his Athenian enemies; and, struck by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a>, rehearsed, with the insolent mockery of a buffoon, the pompous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> lately drawn up by the ardent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a> and too sanguine hopes of Demosthenes. It was on this occasion that the orator <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMADES\">Demades</a> at once rebuked the folly, and flattered the ambition, of Philip, by asking him, Why he allowed the character of Thersites when fortune assigned him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Agamemnon?\n\nWhatever might be the effect of this sharp reprimand, it is certain that the king of Macedon indulged not, on any future occasion, a vain triumph over the vanquished. When advised by his generals to advance into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTICA\">Attica</a>, and to render himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, he only replied, \"Have I done so much for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, and shall I destroy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a> of that glory?\" His subsequent conduct corresponded with the moderation of this sentiment. He restored without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RANSOM\">ransom</a> the Athenian prisoners; who, at departing, having demanded their baggage, were also gratified in this particular; the king pleasantly observing, that the Athenians seemed to think he had not conquered them in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a>. Soon afterwards he dispatched his son Alexander, and Antipater the most trusted of his ministers, to offer them peace on such favourable terms as they had little reason to expect. They were required to send deputies to the isthmus of Corinth, where, to adjust their respective contingents of troops for the Persian expedition, Philip purposed assembling early in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> a general convention of all the Grecian states: they were ordered to surrender the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMOS\">Samos</a>, which actually formed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> station of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, and the main bulwark and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of all their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> or infirm possessions; but they were allowed to enjoy, unmolested, the Attic territory, with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>.\n\nCH\u00c6ROPHYLLUM, chervil.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of this piece of curious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> is owing to the English; whence, in foreign countries, it is denominated the English chain. These chains are usually either of silver <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, some of gilt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>; the thread or wire of each kind to be very fine.\u2014For the fabric, or making of these chains; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the wire is folded into little links of an oval form; the longest diameter about three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>; the shortest one. These, after they have been exactly soldered, are again folded into two; and then bound together or interwoven, by means of several other little threads of the same thickness; some whereof, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> from one end to the other, imitate the warp of a stuff; and the others, which pass transverse, the woof. There are at least four thousand little links in a chain of four pendants; which are by this means bound so equally, and withal so firmly together, that the eye is deceived, and takes the whole to consist of one entire piece.\n\nChain is also a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> in France, in the trade of wood for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>. There are chains for wood by tale, for wood by the rope, for faggots, for cleft wood, and for round sticks. There are also chains for measuring the theaves of all sorts of corn, particularly with regard to the payment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITHES\">tithes</a>; for measuring pottles of hay, and for measuring horses. All these are divided into feet, inches, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, &c., according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> they are designed for.\nChain, in surveying, is a measure, consisting of a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of links of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> wire, usually a hundred; serving to take the dimensions of fields, &c. This is what Mersenius takes to be the arvipedium of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>.\n\nThe chain is of various dimensions, as the length or number of links varies: that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> used in measuring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, called Gunter's chain, is in length four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a> or perches; or sixty-six feet, or a hundred links; each link being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> inches $\\frac{2}{3}$. Whence it is easy to reduce any number of those links to feet, or any number of feet to links.\n\nThis chain is entirely adapted to English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>; and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> convenience is in finding readily the numbers contained in a given field. Where the proportions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> feet and acres differ, the chain, to have the same advantages as Gunter's chain, must also be varied. Thus, in Scotland, the chain ought to be of 74 feet, or 24 Scotch ells, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> regard be had to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the Scotch and English foot; but if regard be had to this difference, the Scotch chain ought to consist of 74$\\frac{1}{2}$ English feet, or 74 feet four inches and $\\frac{1}{3}$ of an inch. This chain being divided into an hundred links, each of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be 8$\\frac{1}{3}$ inches.\n\nThat ordinarily used for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> distances, is in length 100 feet; each link one foot. For small parcels, as gardens, &c., is sometimes used a small chain of one pole, or 16 feet and a half length; each link one inch $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nSome in lieu of chains use <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a>; but these are liable to several irregularities, both from the different degrees of moisture, and of the force which stretches them. Schwenterus, in his Practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">Geometry</a>, tells us, he has observed a rope fifteen feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> reduced to fifteen in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> falling of a hoar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>. To obviate these inconveniences, Wolfius directs, that the little strands whereof the rope consists be twisted contrariwise, and the rope dipped in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, and when dry, drawn through melted wax. A rope thus prepared will not get or lose anything in length, even though kept under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>.\n\n**Chain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">Pump</a>.** See **Pump.**\n\n**Chain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">Shot</a>,** two bullets with a chain between them.

They are formed to extend the shrouds from each other, and from the axis or middle line of the ship, so as to give a greater security and support to the masts, as well as to prevent the shrouds from damaging the gunwale, or being hurt by rubbing against it. Every mast has its chain wales, which are either built above or below the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> deck ports in a ship of the line; they are strongly connected to the side by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a>, bolts, and standards, besides being confined thereto by the chains, whose upper ends pass through notches on the outer edge of the chain wales, so as to unite with the shrouds above.\n\n**Chains,** in Ship-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">Building</a>, are strong links or plates of iron, the lower ends of which are bolted through the ship's side to the timbers.\n\n**Hanging in Chains,** a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> inflicted on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MURDERERS\">murderers</a>.

A bluish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> one. This is the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> of all, and is found in the shape of our flints and pebbles, in masses of two or three inches or more in diameter. It is of a whitish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, with a faint cloud of blue diffused all over it, but always in the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> near the surface. This is a little less hard than the oriental onyx. The oriental chalcedonies are the only ones of any value; they are found in vast abundance on the shores of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> in all parts of the East Indies, and frequently come over among the ballast of the East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> ships. They are common in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILESIA\">Silesia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a>, and other parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> also; but with us are less hard, more opaque, and of very little value. 2. The dull milky-veined chalcedony. This is a stone of little value; and is sometimes met with among our lapidaries, who mistake it for a kind of nephritic stone. It is of a somewhat yellowish white or cream colour, with a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>-white veins. This is principally found in New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>. 3. The third is a brownish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, dull, and cloudy one, known to the ancients by the name of smoky jasper, or jaspis capnitis. This is the least beautiful stone of all the clasps; it is of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> brownish white, clouded all over with a blackish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIST\">mist</a>, as the common chalcedony is with a blue. It is common both in the East and West Indies, and in Germany; but is very little valued, and is seldom worked into anything better than the handles of knives. 4. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> chalcedony is greatly superior to all the rest in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>; and is in great repute in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, though very little known among us.

He opposed Pompey on his entering Syria; but was by him defeated, taken prisoner, and sentenced to death; which, however, he escaped by paying a thousand talents, and was left also in possession of his kingdom. After Arisphobulus king of Judea had been poisoned by the friends of Pompey, and Alexander his son beheaded at Antioch, he sent Philippion his son to Acalon, whither the widow of Arisphobulus had retired with her other children, to bring them all to Chalcis; proposing, as he was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> with one of the daughters named Alexandra, to maintain them in his own kingdom in a manner suitable to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>: but Philippion like\nChalcedonias being in love with Alexandra, married her on the way; for which presumption Ptolemy put him to death on his return, and then took her to wife.

They have a very easy way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a> chalk in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a> in England. It is there found on the sides of hills; and the workmen undermine it so far as appears proper; then digging a trench at the top, as far distant from the edge as the undermining goes at bottom, they fill this with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, which foaks through in the space of a night, upon which the whole flake falls <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> at once. In other parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, chalk generally lies deeper, and they are forced to dig for it at considerable depths, and draw it up in buckets.\n\nChalk is of two kinds; hard, dry, and firm, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> soft and unctuous; both of which are adapted to various purposes. The hard and dry kind is much the poorest for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> into lime; but the soft and unctuous chalk is the best for using as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a> for lands. Chalk, whether burnt into lime or not, is in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> an excellent manure.\n\nPure chalk melts easily with alkali and flint into a transparent colourless glass. With alkaline felspar it melts somewhat more difficulty, and with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BORAX\">borax</a> somewhat more easily, than with flint or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>. It requires about half its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of borax and its whole weight of alkali to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUSE\">fuse</a> it. Sal mirabilis, and sandiver, which do not vitrify at all with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLINE\">crystalline</a> earths, form, with half their weight of chalk, the first a yellowish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, the latter a greenish glass. Nitre, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, one of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> fluxes for flint, does not perfectly vitrify with chalk. This earth notably promotes the vitrification of flint; a mixture of the two requiring less alkali than either of them separately. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> glass made from flint and alkali is further saturated with the flint, so as to be incapable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a>\nbearing any further addition of that earth without becoming opaque and milky, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> fill in a strong fire take up a considerable proportion, one-third or one-fourth of its weight, of chalk, without injury to its transparency: hence chalk is sometimes made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of in compositions for glaas, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> may then be spared. Chalk likewise has a great effect in melting the stony matters intermixed with metallic ores, and hence might be of use in smelting ores; as indeed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a> is used for that purpose. But it is remarkable, that chalk, when deprived of its fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and converted into limestone, loses much of its disposition to vitrify. It is then found to melt very difficultly and imperfectly, and to render the glass opaque and milky.\n\nChalk readily imbibes water; and hence masses of it are employed for drying precipitates, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, earthy powders that have been levigated with water, and other moist preparations. Its economical uses in cleaning and polishing metallic or glass utensils are well known. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> it is powdered and washed from any gritty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> it may contain, and is then called whiting.\u2014In medicine it is one of the most useful absorbents, and is to be looked upon simply as such. The astringent virtues which some have attributed to it have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> foundation, unless in so far as the earth is saturated with an acid, with which it composes a saline concrete manifestly astringent. For the further properties of chalk, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>.\n\nBlack Chalk, a name given by painters to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of earth with which they draw on blue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, &c. It is found in pieces from two to ten feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, and from four inches to twenty in breadth, generally flat, but somewhat rising in the middle, and thinner towards the edges, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> lying in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> quantities together. While in the earth, it is moist and flaky; but being dried, it becomes considerably hard and very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>: but always breaks in some particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>; and if attentively examined when first broken, appears of a striated texture. To the touch it is soft and smooth, stains very freely, and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of its smoothness makes very neat marks. It is easily reduced into an impalpable soft powder without any diminution of its blackness. In this state it mixes easily with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> into a smooth paste; and being diffused through water it slowly settles in a black flaky or muddy form; properties which make its use very convenient to the painters, both in oil and water colours. It appears to be an earth quite different from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> chalk, and rather of the flaky bituminous kind. In the fire it becomes white with a reddish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>, and very friable, retaining its flaky structure, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> much like the white flaky masses which some sorts of pit-coal leave in burning. Neither the chalk nor these ashes are at all affected by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> shops are supplied with this earth from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> or Germany; though some parts of England afford substances nearly, if not entirely, of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, and which are found to be equally serviceable both for marking and as black paints. Such particularly is the black earth called kilow, said by Dr Merret in his Pinax Rerum Britannicarum to be found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANCASHIRE\">Lancashire</a>, and by Mr DaCosta, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of Foffils, to be plentiful near the top of Cay-Avon, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> hill in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MERIONETHSHIRE\">Merionethshire</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> Chalk, an earth much used by painters and artificers, and common in the colour shops. It is properly an indurated clayey ochre, and is dug in Germany, Italy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, and France, but in greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a>. It is of a fine, even, and firm texture; very heavy, and very hard; of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> red on the outside, but of a deep dusky chocolate colour within. It adheres firmly to the tongue, is perfectly insipid to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, and makes no effervescence with acids.\n\nChalk <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">Land</a>. Barley and wheat will succeed very well on the better sort of chalky land, and oats generally do well on any kind of it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> produce of this sort of land in weeds, is that sort of small vetch called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TINE\">tine</a>-tare, with poppies, may-weed, &c. Sainfoin and hop clover will generally succeed tolerably well on these lands; and where they are of a better sort, the great clover will do. The best manure is dung, old rags, and the sheep dung left after folding them.\n\nChalk-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">Stones</a>, in Medicine, signify the concretions of calcareous matter in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> and feet of people violently afflicted with the gout. Leeuwenhoek has been at the pains of examining these by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>. He divides them into three parts. The first is composed of various small parcels of matter looking like white grains of sand; this is harder and drier, and also whiter, than the rest. When examined with large magnifiers, those are found to be composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> particles laid closely and evenly together; though the whole small stones are opaque, their components parts of them are pellucid, and resemble pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> cut short, only that they are somewhat pointed at both ends. These are so extremely thin, that Mr Leeuwenhoek computes, that 1000 of them placed together would not amount to the size of one hair of our heads. The whole stones in this harder part of the chalk are not composed of these particles, but there are confusedly thrown in among them some broken parts of other substances, and in a few places some globules of blood and small remains of other juices. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> kind of chalky matter is less hard and less white than the former, and is composed of fragments or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> parts of those oblong bodies which compose the first or hardest kind, and these are mixed among tough and clear matter, and interspersed with the small broken globules of blood discoverable in the former, but in much greater quantity. The third kind appears red to the naked eye; and, when examined with glaases, is found to be a more tough and clammy white matter, in which a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of globules of blood are interspersed; these give it the red appearance it has.\n\nChallenge, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTEL\">cartel</a> or invitation to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUEL\">duel</a> or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a>*.

Also, though there be no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> objection against the sheriff, if yet he arrays the panel at the nomination, or under the direction of either party, this is good cause of challenge to the array. Formerly, if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> had a cause to be tried, and no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a> was returned upon the jury, it was a cause of challenge to the array: also by the policy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> law, the jury was to come de vicineto, from the neighbourhood of the vill or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where the cause of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> was laid in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a>: and therefore some of the jury were obliged to be returned from the hundred in which such vill lay; and, if none were returned, the array might be challenged from defect of hundreders. For, living in the neighbourhood, these were supposed to know beforehand the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of the parties and witnesses; and therefore they better knew what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to give to the facts alleged in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>. But this convenience was overbalanced by another very natural and almost unavoidable inconvenience; that jurors, coming out of the immediate neighbourhood, would be apt to intermix their prejudices and partialities in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>. And this the law was so sensible of, that it for a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> has been gradually relinquishing this practice; the number of necessary hundreders in the whole panel, which in the reign of Edward III. was constantly six, being in the time of Fortescue reduced to four; afterwards by statute 26 Eliz. c. 6. to two; and at length, by statute 4 and 5 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>, c. 16. it was entirely abolished upon all civil actions, except upon penal statutes; and upon those also by the 24 Geo. II. c. 18. the jury being now only to come de corpore comitatus, from the body of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> at large, and not de vicineto, or from the particular neighbourhood. The array by the ancient law may also be challenged, if an alien be party to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a>, and upon a rule obtained by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> for a jury de mediate lingua, such a one be not returned by the sheriff pursuant to the statute 28 Edward III. c. 13. enforced by 8 Hen. VI. c. 29. which enacts, that where either party is an alien born, the jury shall be one half denizens and the other aliens (if so many be forthcoming in the place), for the more impartial trial; a privilege indulged to strangers in no other country in the world; but which is as ancient in England as the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ETHELRED\">Ethelred</a>, in whose statute de monticolis Wallie (then aliens to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of England), c. 3. it is ordained, that \"duodenii legales homines, quorum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a> Walli et lex Angli erunt, Anglis et Wallis jus dicunto.\"\n\n2. Challenges to the polls, in capitae, are exceptions to particular jurors; and seem to answer the recusatio judicis in the civil and canon laws; by the constitutions of which a judge might be refused upon any suspicion of partiality. By the laws of England also, in the times of Bracton and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLETA\">Fleta</a>, a judge might be refused for good cause; but now the law is otherwise, and it is held that judges or justices cannot be challenged. For the law will not suppose a possibility of bias or favour in a judge who is already sworn to administer impartial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, and whose authority greatly depends on that presumption and idea. And, should the fact at any time prove flagrantly such, as the delicacy of the law will not presume beforehand, there is no doubt but that such misbehaviour would draw down a heavy censure from those to whom the judge is accountable for his conduct. But challenges to the polls of the jury (who are judges of fact) are reduced to four heads by Sir Edward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COKE\">Coke</a>: propter honoris respectum; propter defectum; propter affectum; and propter delictum. 1. Propter honoris respectum; as, if a lord of parliament be impannelled on a jury, he may be challenged by either party, or he may challenge himself. 2. Propter defectum; as, if a jurymen be an alien born, this is defect of birth; if he be a slave or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONDMAN\">bondman</a>, it is defect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, and he cannot be a liber et legalis homo. Under the word homo also, though a name common to both sexes, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> is however excluded, propter defectum sexus: except when a widow feigns herself with child in order to exclude the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a>, and a supposititious birth is suspected to be intended; then upon the writ de ventre inspiciendo, a jury of women is to be impannelled to try the question whether with child or not. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> deficiency is defect of estate sufficient to qualify him to be a juror, which depends upon a variety of statutes*. 3. Jurors* see may be challenged propter affectum, for suspicion of bias Blackstone's or partiality. This may be either a principal challenge, or the favour. A principal challenge is such, where the cause assigned carries with it, prima facie, evident marks of suspicion either of malice or favour; as, that a juror is of kin to either party within the ninth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>; that he has an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> in the cause; that there is an action depending between him and the party; that he has taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> for his verdict, &c., which if true, cannot be overruled; for jurors must be omni exceptione majoris. Challenges to the favour are where the party hath no principal challenge; but objects only some probable circumstances of suspicion, as acquaintance, and the like; the validity of which must be left to the determination of triers, whose office is to decide whether the juror be favourable or unfavourable.\n\n4. Challenges propter delictum, are for some crime or misdemeanor that affects the juror's credit, and renders him infamous: As for a conviction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a>, felony, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERJURY\">perjury</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a>; or if for some infamous offence, he hath received judgment of the pillory or the like.\n\nII. In criminal cases, challenges may be made either on the part of the king, or on that of the prisoner; and either to the whole array, or to the separate polls, for the very same reasons that they may be in civil causes. For it is here at least as necessary as there, that the sheriff or returning officer be totally indifferent; that, where an alien is indicted, the jury should be de mediate, or half foreigners, if so many are found in the place (which does not indeed hold in treasons; aliens being very improper judges of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a>; nor yet in the case of Egyptians under the statute 22 Hen. VIII. c. 10.) that on every panel there should be a competent number of hundreders; and that the particular jurors should be omni exceptione majoris, not liable to objections either propter honoris respectum, propter defectum, propter affectum, or propter delictum.\n\nChallenges\nChallenges on any of the foregoing accounts are fly-led challenges for cause; which may be without flint in both civil and criminal trials. But in criminal cases, or at least in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> ones, there is, in favorem vitae, allowed to the prisoner an arbitrary and capricious species of challenge to a certain number of jurors, without showing any cause at all; which is called a peremptory challenge: a provision full of tenderness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> to prisoners for which our laws are justly famous. This is grounded on two reasons: 1. As every one must be sensible what sudden impressions and unaccountable prejudices we are apt to conceive upon the bare looks and gestures of another; and how necessary it is that a prisoner, when put to defend his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, should have a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of his jury, the want of which might totally disconcert him; the law wills not that he should be tried by any one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> against whom he has conceived a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> even without being able to assign a reason for such his dislike. 2. Because upon challenges for cause shown, if the reason assigned prove insufficient to set aside the juror, perhaps the bare questioning his indifference may sometimes provoke a resentment; to prevent all ill consequences from which, the prisoner is still at liberty, if he pleases, peremptorily to set him aside.\n\nThis privilege of peremptory challenges, though granted to the prisoner, is denied to the king by the statute 33 Edward I. stat. 4, which enacts, that the king shall challenge no jurors without assigning a cause certain to be tried and approved by the court. However, it is held that the king need not assign his cause of challenge till all the panel is gone through, and unless there cannot be a full jury without the persons so challenged. And then, and not sooner, the king's counsel must show the cause, otherwise the juror shall be sworn.\n\nThe peremptory challenges of the prisoner must, however, have some reasonable boundary, otherwise he might never be tried. This reasonable boundary is settled by the common law to the number of 35; that is, one under the number of three full juries. For the law judges, that 35 are fully sufficient to allow the most timorous man to challenge through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> caprice; and that he who peremptorily challenges a greater number, or three full juries, has no intention to be tried at all. And therefore it deals with one who peremptorily challenges above 35, and will not retract his challenge, as with one who stands <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MUTE\">mute</a> or refuses his trial; by sentencing him to the pein forte et dure in felony, and by attainting him in treason. And so the law stands at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> with regard to treason of any kind. But by statute 22 Hen. VIII. c. 14. (which, with regard to felonies, stands unrepealed), no person arraigned for felony can be admitted to make more than 20 peremptory challenges.\n\nCHALONS-SUR-SA\u00d4NE, an ancient town of France, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURGUNDY\">Burgundy</a>, and capital of the Chalonnois, with a citadel and bishop's see.

Chamber of booksellers in Paris, an assembly consisting of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNDIC\">syndic</a> and assistants, elected by four delegates from the printers, and twelve from the booksellers, to visit the books imported from abroad, and to search the houses of sellers of marbled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, print-sellers, and dealers in printed paper for hangings, who are prohibited from keeping any letters proper for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> books. In the visitation of books, which ought to be performed by three persons at least from among the syndic and assistants, all libels against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of God, and the welfare of the state, and all books printed either within or without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> of their regulations and privileges, are kept, even with the merchandises that may happen to be in the bales with such libels or other prohibited books.\nChamber, The days appointed for this chamber to meet are Tuesdays and Fridays, at two o'clock in the afternoon.\n\nChamber, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> affairs. 1.

This officer, on the coronation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, is to bring the king his shirt, coif, and wearing clothes; and after the king is drest, he claims his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, and all the furniture of his chamber, for his fees: he also carries, at the coronation, the coif, gloves, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, to be used by the king on that occasion; also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> and scabbard; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> to be offered by the king, and the robes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> and crown: he drestes and undrestes the king on that day, waits on him before and after dinner, &c.

Before a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a> was appointed, it was his duty to collect the revenue of the crown; and he disbursed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> necessary for the king's expenses, and the maintenance of the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a>. From the time that a treasurer was appointed, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> was limited to the boroughs throughout the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, where he was a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> general, as he had a power for judging of all crimes committed within the borough, and of the crime of foretelling. He was to hold chamberlain ayres every year. He was supreme judge; nor could any of his decrees be questioned by any inferior judicatory. His sentences were put in execution by the magistrates of the boroughs. He also regulated the prices of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> within the borough, and the fees of the workmen in the mint house. His salary was only \u00a3200. a-year. The finalness of his salary, and his great powers, had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> doubt been the causes of much oppre\u00dfion in this officer, and the chamberlain ayres was called rather a legal robbery than a court of justice; and when the combined lords feigned King James VI. August 24. 1582, and carried him to Ruthven Castle, they issued a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a> in the king's name, discharging the chamberlain ayres to be kept. The chamberlain had great fees arising from the profits of elecheats, fines, tolls, and customs. This office was granted heritably to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of Stuart <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Lenox: and when their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> line failed, King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> II. conferred it in like manner upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> son, whom he created duke of Monmouth, and on his forfeiture it went to the duke of Lenox; but that family surrendered the office to the crown in 1793.\n\nLord Chamberlain of the Household, an officer who has the oversight and direction of all officers belonging to the king's chambers, except the precinct of the king's bedchamber.\n\nHe has the oversight of the officers of the wardrobe at all his majesty's houses, and of the removing wardrobes, or of beds, tents, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REVELS\">revels</a>, music, comedians, hunting, messengers, &c. retained in the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>.

When he became of a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, he was put apprentice to Mr Senex the globe-maker, a business which is connected with literature, and especially with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a>. It was during Mr Chambers's residence with this skilful mechanic, that he contracted that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for science and learning which accompanied him through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, and directed all his pursuits. It was even at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that he formed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, the \"Cyclopedia;\" and some of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of it were written behind the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a>. Having conceived the idea of so great an undertaking, he justly concluded that the execution of it would not confit with the avocations of trade; and therefore he quitted Mr Senex, and took chambers at Gray's Inn, where he chiefly resided during the rest of his days. The first edition of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CYCLOPAEDIA\">Cyclopaedia</a>, which was the result of many years intense application, appeared in 1728, in two vols. folio. It was published by subscription, the price being 4l. 4s.; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of subscribers was very respectable. The dedication, which was to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, is dated October 15, 1727. The reputation that Mr Chambers acquired by his execution of this undertaking, procured him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of being elected F. R. S. November 6, 1729. In less than ten years time a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> edition became necessary; which accordingly was printed, with corrections and additions, in 1738; and was followed by a third the very next year.\n\nAlthough the Cyclopaedia was the grand business of Mr Chambers's life, and may be regarded as almost the sole foundation of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> was not wholly confined to this undertaking. He was concerned in a periodical publication, entitled, \"The Literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>,\" which was begun in 1735. In this work he wrote a variety of articles, and particularly a review of Morgan's \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Moral <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>.\" He was engaged likewise, in conjunction with Mr John Martyn, F.

S. and professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">botany</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, in preparing for the press a translation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ABRIDGMENT\">abridgment</a> of the \"Philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Academy of Sciences at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> an Abridgment of all the Papers relating to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> Philosophy, which have been published by the Members of that illustrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>.\" This undertaking, when completed, was comprised in five volumes, 8vo, which did not appear till 1742, some time after our author's decease, when they were published under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> names of Mr Martyn and Mr Chambers. Mr Martyn, in a subsequent publication, hath passed a severe censure upon the share which his fellow-labourer had in the abridgment of the Parisian papers. The only work besides, that we find ascribed to Mr Chambers, is a translation of the Jesuit's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">Perspective</a>, from the French; which was printed in 4to, and hath gone through several editions. Mr Chambers's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> and unremitting attention to his studies at length impaired his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, and obliged him occasionally to take a lodging at Canonbury-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, Islington. This not having greatly contributed to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a>, he made an excursion to the south of France, but did not reap that benefit from it which he had himself hoped, and his friends wished.

See Alps and Blanc.\n\nThe first strangers whom a curiosity to visit the glaciers drew to Chamouni (M. Sauflure observes), certainly considered this valley as a den of robbers; for they came armed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>-a-pee, attended with a troop of domestics armed in the same manner: they would not venture into any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>; they lived in tents which they had brought along with them; fires were kept <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>, and sentinels on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> the whole night over. It was in the year 1741 that the celebrated traveller Pocock, and another English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> called Wyndham, undertook this interesting journey. It is remembered by the old men of Chamouni, and they still laugh at the fears of the travellers, and at their unnecessary precautions. For 20 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 25 years after this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, the journey was made but seldom, and then chiefly by Englishmen, who lodged with the curate: for, when I was there in 1760, and even for four or five years afterwards, there was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> habitable house except one or two miserable inns, like those in villages that are little frequented. But now that this expedition has gradually become so fashionable, three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and good inns, which have been successively built, are hardly sufficient to contain the travellers that come during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> from all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>.\n\nThis concourse of strangers, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> they leave behind them at Chamouni, have somewhat affected the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> simplicity of the inhabitants, and even the purity of their manners. Nobody, however, has any thing to fear from them: the most inviolable fidelity is observed with respect to travellers; they are only exposed to a few impertinent solicitations, and some small artifices dictated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> eagerness with which the inhabitants offer their services as guides.\n\nThe hope of obtaining this employment brings together, round a traveller, almost all the men in every village through which he passes, and makes him believe that there are a great many in the valley; but there are very few at Chamouni in summer. Curiosity, or the hope of making money, draws many to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> and into Germany: besides, as the shepherds of Chamouni have the reputation of excelling in the making of cheese, they are in great request in the Tarentaise, in the valley of Aoste, and even at greater distances; and they receive there, for four or five months in summer, very considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a>. Thus the labours of the field devolve almost entirely on the women, even such as in other countries <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> solely on the men; as plowing, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> of wood, and thrashing: even the animals of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a> are not spared, for the cows there are yoked in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>.\n\nThe only labours that belong exclusively to the men are the seeking for rock crystal and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a>. Happily they are now less employed than formerly in the first of these occupations; I say happily, for many of them perished in this pursuit. The hope of enriching themselves quickly by the discovery of a cavern filled with fine crystals, was so powerful a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a>, that they exposed themselves in the search to the most alarming dangers; and hardly a year passed without some of them perishing in the snows, or among the precipices.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> indication of the grottoes, or crystal ovens as they are here called, are veins of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTZ\">quartz</a>, which appear.\nappear on the outside of the rocks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a>, or of the laminated rock. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> veins are seen at a distance, and often at great heights, on vertical and inaccessible places. The adventurers endeavour to arrive at these, either by fabricating a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> across the rocks, or by letting themselves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> from above suspended by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a>. When they reach the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, they gently strike the rock; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> returns a hollow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>, they endeavour to open it with a hammer, or to blow it up with powder. This is the principal method of searching: but young people, and even children, often go in quest of these crystals over the glaciers, where the rocks have lately fallen down. But whether they consider these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> as nearly exhausted, or that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of crystal found at Madagascar has too much lowered the price of this fossil, there are now but few people that go in search of it, and perhaps there is not a single person at Chamouni that makes it his only occupation. They go however occasionally, as to a party of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>.\n\nBut the chase of the chamois goat, as dangerous, and perhaps more so than the seeking for crystal, still occupies many inhabitants of the mountains, and carries off, in the flower of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, many men whose lives are most valuable to their families. And when we are informed how this chase is carried on, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be astonished that a course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, at once so laborious and perilous, should have irresistible attractions for those who have been accustomed to it.\n\nThe chamois hunter generally sets out in the night, that he may reach by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> the most elevated pastures where the goats come to feed, before they arrive. As soon as he discovers the place where he hopes to find them, he surveys it with his glaas. If he finds none of them there, he proceeds, always ascending; whenever he descends any, he endeavours to get above them, either by stealing along some gully, or getting behind some rock or eminence. When he is near enough to distinguish their horns, which is the mark by which he judges of the distance, he rests his piece on a rock, takes his aim with great composure, and rarely misses. This piece is a rifle-barrelled carbine, into which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> is thrust, and these carbines often contain two charges, though they have but one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a>; the charges are set one above another, and are fired in succession. If he has wounded the chamois, he runs to his prey, and for security he hamstring it; then he considers his way home: if the road is difficult, he skins the chamois, and leaves the carcass; but, if it is practicable, he throws the animal on his shoulders, and bears him to his village, though at a great distance, and often over frightful precipices: he feeds his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, which is excellent, especially when the creature is young; and he dries the skins for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>.\n\nBut if, as is the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the vigilant chamois perceives the approach of the hunter, he immediately takes flight among the glaciers, through the snows, and over the most precipitous rocks. It is particularly difficult to get near these animals when there are several together; for then one of them, while the rest are feeding, stands as a sentinel on the point of some rock that commands a view of the avenues leading to the pasture; and as soon as he perceives any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of alarm, he utters a sort of hiss; at which the others instantly gather round him to judge for themselves of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the danger: if it is a wild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a>, Chamouni, or a hunter, the most experienced puts himself at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the flock, and away they fly, ranged in a line, to the most inaccessible retreats.\n\nIt is here that the fatigues of the hunter begin; instigated by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for the chase, he is inflexible to danger: he passes over snows, without thinking of the horrid precipices they conceal; he entangles himself among the most dangerous paths, and bounds from rock to rock, without knowing how he is to return. Night often surprizes him in the midst of his pursuit; but he does not for that reason abandon it; he hopes that the same cause will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARREST\">arrest</a> the flight of the chamois, and that he will next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> overtake them. Thus he passes the night, not at the foot of a tree, like the hunter of the plains; not in a grotto, softly reclined on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of moss; but at the foot of a rock, and often on the bare <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of shattered fragments, without the smallest shelter. There, all alone, without fire, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, he draws from his bag a bit of cheese, with a morsel of oatmeal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, which make his common food; bread so dry, that he is sometimes obliged to break it between two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, or with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HATCHET\">hatchet</a> he carries with him to cut out steps in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>. Having thus made his solitary and frugal repast, he puts a stone below his head for a pillow, and goes to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, dreaming on the route which the chamois may have taken. But soon he is awakened by the freshness of the morning; he gets up, benumbed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>; surveys the precipices, which he must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a>, in order to overtake his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAME\">game</a>; drinks a little brandy, of which he is always provided with a small portion, and sets out to encounter new dangers. Hunters sometimes remain in these solitudes for several days together, during which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> their families, their unhappy wives in particular, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> a state of the most dreadful anxiety: they dare not go to rest for fear of seeing their husbands appear to them in a dream; for it is a received <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, that when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> has perished, either in the snow, or on some unknown rock, he appears by night to the person he held most dear, describes the place that proved fatal to him, and requests the performance of the last duties to his corpse.\n\n\"After this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of the life which the chamois hunters <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, could one imagine that this chase would be the object of a passion absolutely unfurmountable? I knew a well-made, handsome man, who, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> married a beautiful woman\u2014my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a>-uncle, father said he to me, lost his life in the chase; so did my father; and I am persuaded that I too shall die in the same manner; this bag which I carry with me when I hunt I call my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> clothes, for I am sure I will have no other; yet if you should offer to make my fortune on condition of abandoning the chase of the chamois, I could not consent.\" I made some excursions on the Alps with this man: His strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> were astonishing; but his temerity was greater than his strength; and I have heard, that two years afterwards, he missed a step on the brink of a precipice, and met with the fate he had expected.\n\n\"The few who have grown old in this employment bear upon their faces the marks of the lives they have led. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> look, something in it haggard and wild, makes them be known in the midst of a crowd, even...\"\nChamouni, when they are not in their hunting drefs. And undoubtedly it is this ill look which makes some superstitious peasants believe that they are sorcerers, that they have dealings with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a> in their solitudes, and that it is he who throws them down the rocks.\n\nWhat then can be the passionate inducement to this course of life? It is not avarice, at least it is not an avarice consistent with reason: the most beautiful chamois is never worth more to the person that kills it than a dozen of francs, even including the value of its flesh; and now that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> is so much diminished, the time lost before one can be taken is much more than its value. But it is the very dangers that attend the pursuit, those alternations of hope and fear, the continual agitation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> which these emotions produce in the mind, that infligate the hunter: they animate him as they do the gamekeeper, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a>, the sailor, and even to a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, the naturalist of the Alps; whose life, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, pretty much resembles that of the hunter, whose manners we have described.\n\nBut there is another kind of hunting, which is neither dangerous nor laborious, nor fatal to any one but to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> animals that are the objects of it.\u2014These are the marmots, animals that inhabit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> mountains; where in summer they scoop out holes, which they line with hay, and retire to at the beginning of autumn. Here they grow torpid with the cold, and remain in a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETHARGY\">lethargy</a>, till the warmth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> returns to quicken their languid blood, and to recall them to life. When it is supposed that they have retired to their winter abode, and before the snow has covered the high pastures where their holes are made, people go to unharrow them. They are found from 10 to 13 in the same hole, heaped upon one another, and buried in the hay. Their sleep is so profound, that the hunter often puts them into his bag, and carries them home without their awaking. The flesh of the young is good, though it tastes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, and smells somewhat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>; the fat is used in the cure of rheumatism and pains, being rubbed on the parts affected; but the skin is of little value, and is sold for no more than five or six sous. Notwithstanding the little benefit they reap from it, the people of Chamouni go in quest of this animal with great eagerness, and its numbers accordingly diminish very sensibly.\n\nIt has been said, that marmots, in order to transport the hay into their holes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> one of their number laid on his back as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CART\">cart</a>; but this is fabulous, for they are seen carrying the hay in their mouths. Nor is it for food that they gather it, but for a bed, and in order to shut out the cold, and to guard the avenues of their retreat from enemies. When they are taken in autumn, their bowels are quite empty, and even as clean as if they had been washed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; which proves that their torpidity is preceded by a fast, and even by an evacuation; a wise contrivance of nature for preventing their accumulated feces from growing putrid or too dry, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> lethargy they are exposed to. They also continue a few days after their revival without eating, probably to allow the circulation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGESTIVE\">digestive</a> power to recover their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>. At first, leaving their holes, they appear stupid and dazzled with the light; they are at this time killed with sticks, as they do not endeavour to fly, and their bowels are then also quite empty. They are not very lean when they awake, but grow more so for a few days after they first come abroad. Their blood is never congealed, however profound their sleep may be; for at the time that it is deepest, if they are bled, the blood flows as if they were awake.\n\nIn these countries the period is so short between the dilution of the snow, and its return, that grain has hardly time to come to maturity. Mr Sauflure mentions a very useful and ingenious practice, invented by the mountaineers of the Argentiere, for enlarging this period, \"I observed (says he, in the middle of the valley, several large spaces where the surface of the snow exhibited a singular appearance, somewhat resembling a piece of white cloth spotted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>. While I was endeavouring to divine the cause of this phenomenon, I discovered several women walking with measured pace, and fowling something in handfuls that was black; and which being scattered, regularly diverging, on the surface of the snow, formed that spotted appearance that I had been admiring. I could not conceive what seed should be sown on snow fix feet deep; but my guide astonished at my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, informed me that it was black <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> spread upon the snow to accelerate its melting; and thus to anticipate, by a fortnight or three weeks, the time of labouring the fields and fowling. I was struck with the elegant simplicity of a practice so useful, the effects of which I already <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> very evidently in places which had not been thus treated above three days.\n\n\"As to the inhabitants of Chamouni, the men, like those of most high valleys, are neither well made nor tall; but they are nervous and strong, as are also the women. They do not attain to a great age: men of 80 are very rare. Inflammatory diseases are the most fatal to them; proceeding no doubt, from obstructed perspiration, to which the inconstant temperature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> exposes them.\n\n\"They are in general honest, faithful, and diligent in the practice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> duties. It would, for instance, be in vain to persuade them to go anywhere on a holiday before hearing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>. They are economical, but charitable. There are amongst them neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a> nor foundations for the poor; but orphans and old people, who have no means of subsistence, are entertained by every inhabitant of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> in his turn. If a man is prevented by age or infirmities from taking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of his affairs, his neighbours join among themselves and do it for him.\n\n\"Their mind is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> and lively, their temper gay, with an inclination to raillery: they observe, with singular acuteness, the ridiculous in strangers, and turn it into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> of very facetious merriment among themselves, yet they are capable of serious thinking: many of them have attacked me on religious and metaphysical subjects: not as professing a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> from theirs, but on general questions, which showed they had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> independent of those they were taught.\"","sp":403,"ep":406},{"h":"CHAMPAGNE","t":"a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of France, about 162 miles in length, and 112 in breadth, bounded on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> by Hainault and Luxembourg, on the east by Lorraine and the Franche Compte, on the south by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURGUNDY\">Burgundy</a>, and on the west by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">Isle</a> of France.\nChampagne France and Soissonnois.

The ordinary legal court holds pleas of recognizances acknowledged in the chancery, writs of scire facias, for repeal of letters patent, writs of partition, &c., and also of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> actions by or against any officer of the court.

The extraordinary court, or court of equity, proceeds by the rules of equity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>, and moderates the rigour of the common law, considering the intention rather than the words of the law. It gives relief for and against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> notwithstanding their minority, and for or against married women notwithstanding their coverture. All frauds and deceits for which there is no redress at common law; all breaches of trust and confidence; and accidents, as to relieve obligors, mortgagees, &c. against penalties and forfeitures, where the intent was to pay the debt, are here remedied: for in chancery, a forfeiture, &c. shall not bind, where a thing may be done after, or compensation made for it. Also this court <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> give relief against the extremity of unreasonable engagements entered into without consideration; oblige creditors that are unreasonable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> with an unfortunate debtor; and make executors, &c. give security and pay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> that is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>.

In chancery, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a>-holders may be relieved against the ill usage of their lords; enclosures of lands that are common be decreed; and this court may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> money or lands given to charitable uses, oblige men to account with each other, &c. But in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> where the plaintiff can have his remedy at law, he ought not to be relieved in chancery; and a thing which may be tried by a jury is not triable in this court.\n\nThe proceedings in chancery are, first to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILE\">file</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> of complaint, signed by some counsel, setting forth the fraud or injury done, or wrong sustained, and praying relief: after the bill is filed, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of subpoena issues to compel the defendant to appear; and when the defendant appears, he puts in his answer to the bill of complaint, if there be no cause for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEA\">plea</a> to the jurisdiction of the court, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISABILITY\">disability</a> of the person, or in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>, &c. Then the plaintiff brings his replication, unless he files exceptions against the answer as insufficient, referring it to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> to report whether it be sufficient or not; to which report exceptions may also be made. The answer, replication, rejoinder, &c. being settled, and the parties come to issue, witnesses are to be examined upon interrogatories, either in court or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, wherein the parties usually join; and when the plaintiff and defendant have examined their witnesses, publication is to be made of the depositions, and the cause is to be set <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> for hearing; after which follows the decree. But it is now usual to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of lords; which appeals are to be signed by two noted counsel, and exhibited by way of petition; the petition or appeal is lodged with the clerk of the house of lords, and read in the house, whereon the appellee is ordered to put in his answer, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> fixed for hearing the cause: and after coun-\n\nfel heard, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> given on both sides, the lords Chandelier will affirm or reverse the decree of the chancery, and finally determine the cause by a majority of votes, &c.","sp":409,"ep":410},{"h":"CHANDERNAGORE","t":"a French settlement in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a> in the East Indies.

Here he entered into the matrimonial state, and began to have an increasing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, when, by the fatal South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> scheme of 1720, he unfortunately lost the whole fortune which he had received with his wife. His circumstances being thereby embarrassed, and his income as a minister being inadequate to his expenses, he engaged in the trade of a bookseller, and kept a shop in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POULTRY\">Poultry</a>, London, for about two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> three years, still continuing to discharge the duties of the pastoral office. He also officiated as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> preacher with the learned Dr Lardner of a winter weekly evening lecture at the meeting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> in the Old Jewry, London; in which meeting he was established assistant preacher about\nabout the year 1725, and then as the pastor. Here he administered to the religious improvement of a very respectable congregation for 40 years with the greatest applause; and with what diligence and application he improved the vacancies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> from his pastoral duties, for improving himself and benefiting the world, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> appear from his many writings on a variety of important subjects. While he was thus laudably employed, not only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> and Aberdeen gave him, without any application, testimonials of their esteem in diplomas, conferring on him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of D.D., but he also received offers of preferment from some of the governors of the established <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, which he nobly declined. He had likewise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of being afterwards elected F.R. and A.SS.\n\nOn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of George II. in 1760, Dr Chandler published a sermon on that event, in which he compared that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>. This gave rise to a pamphlet, which was printed in the year 1761, entitled \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">Man</a> after God's own Heart,\" wherein the author ventured to exhibit King David as an example of perfidy, lust, and cruelty, fit only to be ranked with a Nero or a Caligula; and complained of the insult that had been offered to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of the late British monarch by Dr Chandler's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> between him and the king of Israel. This attack occasioned Dr Chandler to publish in the following year \"A Review of the History of the Man after God's own Heart; in which the Falshoods and Misrepresentations of the Historian are exposed and corrected.\" He also prepared for the press a more elaborate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, which was afterwards published in two volumes 8vo, under the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>: \"A Critical History of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">Life</a> of David;\" in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> Events are ranged in Order of time; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> Objections of Mr Bayle and others against the Character of this Prince, the Scripture Account of him, and the Occurrences of his Reign, are examined and refuted; and the Psalms which refer to him explained.\" As this was the last, it was likewise one of the best, of Dr Chandler's productions. The greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of this work was printed off at the time of our author's death, which happened May 8, 1766, aged 73. During the last year of his life, he was visited with frequent returns of a very painful disorder, which he endured with great resignation and Christian fortitude. He was interred in the burying-ground at Bunhill-fields on the 16th of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>; and his funeral was very honourably attended by ministers and other gentlemen. He expressly desired, by his last will, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> delineation of his character might be given in his funeral sermon, which was preached by Dr Amory. He had several children; two sons and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> who died before him, and three daughters who survived him; two of whom are yet living, and both married, one of them to the Rev. Dr Harwood.\n\nDr Chandler was a man of very extensive learning and eminent abilities; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> was quick and his judgment penetrating; he had a warm and vigorous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>; he was a very instructive and animated preacher; and his talents in the pulpit and as a writer procured him very great and general esteem, not only among the dissenters, but among <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> numbers of the established church. He was principally instrumental in the establishment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> for relieving the widows and orphans of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> Protestant dissenting ministers: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of it was first formed by him; and it was by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> and application to his friends that many of the subscriptions for its support were procured.\n\nIn 1768, four volumes of our author's sermons were published by Dr Amory, according to his own directions in his last will; to which were prefixed a neat engraving of him, from an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> by Mr Chamberlin. He also expressed a desire to have some of his principal pieces reprinted in four volumes 8vo; proposals were accordingly published for that purpose, but did not meet with sufficient encouragement. But in 1777, another work of our author was published in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> 4to, under the following title: \"A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAPHRASE\">Paraphrase</a> and Notes on the Epistles of St Paul to the Galatians and Ephesians, with doctrinal and practical Observations: together with a critical and practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMENTARY\">Commentary</a> on the two Epistles of St Paul to the Thessalonians.\" Dr Chandler also left, in his interleaved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a>, a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of critical notes, chiefly in Latin, which are now the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of Dr Kippis, Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">Farmer</a>, Dr Price, and Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">Savage</a>, and which have been intended to be published; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> has not yet been executed.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> is well watered by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, streams, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>; but is nevertheless liable to suffer from drought, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> falls here but seldom. The locusts also sometimes make great devastation. However, it abounds greatly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAME\">game</a>; and there is perhaps <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> country where quails, partridges, and pheasants, are sold cheaper, the inhabitants of this province being reckoned the keenest sportsmen in the empire. The province is greatly enriched by the river Yuen, called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> Imperial Canal, through which all the barks bound to Pekin must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> in their way thither. The duties on this canal alone amount to more than 450,000l. annually. The canal itself is greatly admired by European travellers on account of its strong and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> dikes, the banks decorated with cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, the ingenious mechanism of its locks, and the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> obstacles which have been overcome in the execution of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>.\u2014The province produces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> of the ordinary kind; and besides this, another from a sort of insect resembling our caterpillar. It is coarser than the ordinary silk, but much stronger and more durable; so that the stuffs made from it have a very extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> throughout the empire.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANG\">Chang</a>-tong is remarkable for being the birthplace of the celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> and lawgiver <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUCIUS\">Confucius</a>. His native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> is called Kia-fou, where there are several monuments erected in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of this great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>. The province is divided into five districts, which contain five cities of the first class, and 114 of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> and third. Along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, also, are 15 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 16 villages of considerable importance on account of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>; there is likewise a number of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, most of which have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a> very convenient for the Chinese junks which pass from thence to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COREA\">Corea</a> or Lea-tong. The most remarkable cities are, 1, Tsi-nan-fou,\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, which stands south of the river T'ing-ho or T'hi. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and populous; but chiefly celebrated for having been the residence of a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of kings, whose tombs, rising on the neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, afford a beautiful prospect. 2. Yen-tcheu-fou, the second city of the province, situated between two rivers, and in a mild and temperate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>. Great quantities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> are said to have been formerly collected in its neighbourhood. 3. Lin-tchin-tcheu, situated on the great canal, is much frequented by ships, and may be called a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">magazine</a> for every kind of merchandise. Here is an octagonal tower, divided into eight stories, the walls of which are covered on the outside with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORCELAIN\">porcelain</a> loaded with various figures neatly executed, and incrustated on the inside with variously coloured marble. A staircase, constructed in the wall, conduits to all the stories, from which there are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> into magnificent galleries ornamented with gilt ballustrades. All the cornices and projections of the tower are furnished with little bells; which, says M. Grohier, when agitated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, form a very agreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>. In the highest story is an idol of gilt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, to which the tower is dedicated.

See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">Combination</a>.\n\nTo find all the possible Changes of any number of Quantities, or how oft their Order may be varied.] Suppose two quantities $a$ and $b$. Since they may be either wrote $<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">ab</a>$ or $ba$, it is evident their changes are $2^2 = 4$. Suppose three quantities $abc$: their changes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be as in the margin; as is evident by combining $c$ first with $ab$, then with $ba$; and hence $abc$ the number of changes arises $3 \\cdot 2 = 6$. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the quantities be $4$, each may be combined four ways with each order of the other three; whence the number of changes arises $6 \\cdot 4 = 24$. Therefore, if the number of quantities be supposed $n$, the number of changes will be $n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-4)$. &c. If the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> occur twice, the changes of two will be found $b$; of three, $aba, abba, bba, bab, bac, acb$. And thus the number of changes in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> will be $1 = (2 \\cdot 1) : 2 \\cdot 1$; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, $3 = (3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1) : 2 \\cdot 1$.\n\nIf a fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> be added, in each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of four quantities, it will beget five changes, whence the number of all the changes will be $6 = (5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1) : 2 \\cdot 1$. Hence if the number of quantities be $n$, the number of changes will be $(n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-4))$. &c. $= 2 \\cdot 1$. From these special formulae may be collected a general one, viz. if $n$ be the number of quantities, and $m$ the number which shows how oft the same quantity occurs; we shall have $(n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-4))$. &c. $= 2 \\cdot 1$. The series being to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, till the continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUBTRACTION\">subtraction</a> of unity from $n$ and $m$ leave $0$. After the same manner we may proceed further, till putting $n$ for the number of quantities, and $l, m, r, &c.$ for the number that shows how oft any of them is repeated, we arrive at an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> form. $(n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-4))$. &c. $= (l,l-1,l-2,l-3,l-4,l-5, &c., m,m-1,m-2,m-3, &c., r,r-1,r-2,r-3,r-4,r-5, &c.)$\n\nSuppose, for instance, $n = 6, l = 3, r = 0$. The number of changes will be $(6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) : (3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1) = (6, 5, 4) : (3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1) = 622702800$.\n\nIn this manner may all the possible anagrams of any word be found in all languages, and that without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>: suppose, v.g. it were required to find the anagrams of the word amor, the number of changes will be\n\n$$\\begin{<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARRAY\">array</a>}{cccc}\na & o & a & m \\\\\no & a & m & r \\\\\nm & a & o & r \\\\\na & m & o & r \\\\\n\\end{array}$$\n\nThe anagrams therefore of the word amor, in the Latin tongue, are roma, mora, maro, ramo, amo.

See Earth.","sp":413,"ep":413},{"h":"CHAOS","t":"that confusion in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> lay when newly produced out of nothing at the beginning of the world, before God, by his almighty word, had put it into the order and condition wherein it was after the six days <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">Earth</a>.\n\nChaos is represented by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> as the first principle, ovum, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> seed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and the world. All the sophists, fages, naturalists, philosophers, theologues, and poets, held that chaos was the eldest and first principle, \u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9. The Barbarians, Phoenicians, Egyptians, Persians, &c. all refer the origin of the world to a rude, mixed, confused <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of matter. The Greeks, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORPHEUS\">Orpheus</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HESIOD\">Hesiod</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENANDER\">Menander</a>, Aridophanes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EURIPIDES\">Euripides</a>, and the writers of the Cyclic Poems, all speak of the first chaos; the Ionic and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATONIC\">Platonic</a> philosophers build the world out of it. The Stoics hold, that as the world was first made of a chaos, it shall at last be reduced to a chaos; and that its periods and revolutions in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> are only transitions from one chaos to another. Lastly, The Latins, as Ennius, Varro, Ovid, Lucretius, Statius, &c. are all of the same\nNor is there any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> whatever that does not derive their *diaorunias*, the structure of the world, from a chaos.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> first arose among the Barbarians, whence it spread to the Greeks, and from the Greeks to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> and other nations. Dr Burnet observes, that besides <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> and a few other Pseudo-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGOREANS\">Pythagoreans</a>, nobody ever asserted that our world was always from eternity of the same nature, form, and structure, as at present; but that it had been the standing opinion of the wise men of all ages, that what we now call the terrestrial globe, was originally an unformed, indigested mass of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a> matter, called *chaos*; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> and materials of the present world.\n\nIt does not appear who first broached the notion of a chaos. Moses, the eldest of all writers, derives the origin of this world from a confusion of matter, dark, void, deep, without form, which he calls *tobu bohu*; which is precisely the chaos of the Greek and Barbarian philosophers. Moses goes no further than the chaos, nor tells us whence it took its origin, or whence its confused state; and where Moses stops, there precisely do all the rest. Dr Burnet endeavours to show that as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> philosophers, &c., who wrote of the cosmogony, acknowledged a chaos for the principle of their world; so the divines, or writers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEOGONY\">theogony</a>, derive the origin or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> of their fabled gods from the same principle.\n\nMr Whiston supposed the ancient chaos, the origin of our earth, to have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> of a comet; which, though new, yet, all things considered, is not the most improbable assertion. He endeavours to make it out by many arguments, drawn from the agreement which appears to be between them. So that, according to him, every planet is a comet, formed into a regular and lasting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, and placed at a proper distance from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, revolving in a nearly circular orbit; and a comet is a planet either beginning to be destroyed or re-made; that is, a chaos or planet uniformed or in its primeval state, and placed as yet in an orbit very eccentric.\n\n*Chaos*, in the phrase of Paracelcus, imports the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>.

In the earlier ages, the bishop was head of the chapter; afterwards abbots and other dignitaries, as deans, provosts, treasurers, &c. were preferred to this distinction. The deans and chapters had the privilege of choosing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> in England; but Henry VIII. got this power vested in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>; and as the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> expelled the monks from the cathedrals, and placed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> canons in their room, those he thus regulated were called deans and chapters of the new foundation; such are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTERBURY\">Canterbury</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINCHESTER\">Winchester</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELY\">Ely</a>, Carlisle, &c.

It was so named from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Chorax, called first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, from its founder Alexander the Great; afterwards Antiochia, from Antiochus V. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, who repaired and beautified it; and lastly, Chorax Spafine, or Pafine, that is, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOLE\">Mole</a> of the Spafines, an Arabian king of that name having secured it against the overflowing of the Tigris, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> or mole, extending three miles, which served as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FENCE\">fence</a> to all that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. Dionysius Periegetes, and Hidorus, author of the Parthae Manfones, were both natives of this city. The small district of Characene was seized by Pafines, the son of Sogdonacus, king of the neighbouring Arabs, during the troubles of Syria, and erected into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. Lucian calls him Hylpafines, and adds, that he ruled over the Characeni and the neighbouring people: he died in the 85th year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. The other kings of this country we find mentioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> are, Ter\u00e6us, who died in the 92d year of his age, and after him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTABAZUS\">Artabazus</a> the seventh, as Lucian informs us, who was driven from the throne by his own subjects, but restored by the Parthians. And this is all we find in the ancients relating to the kings of Characene.\n\nCharacter, in a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, signifies a mark or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, drawn on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, metal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a>, graver, chisel, or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, to signify or denote any thing. The word is Greek, \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, formed from the verb, \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03b6\u03c9, inculpere, \"to engrave, impress,\" &c.\n\nThe various kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> may be reduced to three heads, viz. Literal Characters, Numerical Characters, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABBREVIATIONS\">Abbreviations</a>.\n\nI. Literal Character, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a>, serving to indicate some articulate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>, expressive of some idea or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of the mind. See Alphabet.\n\n1. They may be divided, with regard to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and use, into Nominal Characters, or those we properly call letters; which serve to express the names of things: See Letter. Real Characters; those that instead of names express things and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>: See Idea, &c. Emblematical or Symbolical Characters: which have this in common with real ones, that they express the things themselves; but have thus further, that they in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> personate them, and exhibit their form: such are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIEROGLYPHICS\">hieroglyphics</a> of the ancient Egyptians. See Hieroglyphic, Symbol, &c.\n\n2. Literal Characters may be again divided, with regard to their invention and use, into particular and general or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>.\n\nParticular Characters, are those peculiar to this or that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>. Such are the Roman, Italic, Greek, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a>, Arabic, Gothic, Chinese, &c. characters.\u2014See Hebrew, Gothic, Chinese, &c.\nUniversal Characters, are also real characters, and make what some authors call a Philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">Language</a>.\n\nThat diversity of characters used by the several nations to express the same idea, is found the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> obstacle to the advancement of learning: to remove this, several authors have taken occasion to propose plans of characters that should be universal, and which each people should read in their own language. The character here is to be real, not nominal; to express things and notions; not, as the common ones, letters or sounds: yet to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MUTE\">mute</a>, like letters, and arbitrary; not emblematical, like hieroglyphics.\n\nThus, every nation should retain its own language, yet every one understand that of each other, without learning it; only by seeing a real or universal character, which should signify the same things to all people, by what sounds forever each expresses it in their particular idiom. For instance, by seeing the character defined to signify to drink, an Englishman should read to drink; a Frenchman, boire; a Latin, bibere; a Greek, \u03c0\u03af\u03bd\u03c9; a Jew, \u05d9\u05d9\u05df; a German, trinken; and so of the rest: in the same manner as seeing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, each people expresses it after their own manner; but all mean the same animal.\n\nThis real character is no chimera; the Chinese and Japanese have already something like it. They have a common character which each of those nations understand alike in their several languages; though they pronounce them with such different sounds, that they do not understand one another in speaking.\n\nThe first and most considerable attempts for a real character, or philosophical language, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, are those of Bishop Wilkins and Dalgarno: but these, with how much art forever they were contrived, have yet proved ineffectual.\n\nM. Leibnitz had some thoughts the same way; he thinks those great men did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HIT\">hit</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> method. It was probable, indeed, that by their means, people, who do not understand one another might easily have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> together; but they have not hit on true real characters.\n\nAccording to him, the characters should resemble those used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALGEBRA\">algebra</a>: which, in effect, are very simple, yet very expressive; without anything superfluous or equivocal; and contain all the varieties required.\n\nThe real character of Bishop Wilkins has its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> applause: Dr. Hook recommends it on his own knowledge and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, as a most excellent scheme; and to engage the world to the study thereof, publishes some fine inventions of his own therein.\n\nM. Leibnitz tells us, he had under consideration an alphabet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> thoughts; in order to a new philosophical language, on his own scheme: but his death prevented its being brought to maturity.\n\nM. Lodwig, in the Philosophical Transactions, gives us a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of an universal alphabet or character of another kind: this was to contain an enumeration of all such single sounds, or letters, as are used in any language; by means whereof, people should be enabled to pronounce truly and readily any language; to describe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRONUNCIATION\">pronunciation</a> of any language that shall be pronounced in their hearing, so as others accustomed to this language, though they had never heard the language pronounced, shall at first be able truly to pronounce it: and, lastly, this character to serve as a standard to perpetuate the sounds of any language. In the Journal Litteraire, an. 1720, we have a very ingenious project for an universal character. The author, after obviating the objections that might be made against the feasibility of such schemes in the general, proposes his own: his characters are to be the common Arabic, or numeral figures. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> are sufficient to express distinctly an incredible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of numbers, much more than we shall need terms to signify our actions, goods, evils, duties, passions, &c. Thus is all the trouble of framing and learning any new character at once saved; the Arabic figures having already all the universality required.\n\nThe advantages are immense. For, too, we have here a stable, faithful interpreter; never to be corrupted or changed, as the popular languages continually are. Whereas the difficulty of pronouncing a foreign language is such as usually gives the learner the greatest trouble, and there are even some sounds which foreigners never attain to: in the character here proposed, this difficulty has no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>: every nation is to pronounce them according to the particular pronunciation that already obtains among them. All the difficulty is, the accustoming the pen and the eye to affix certain notions to characters that do not, at first sight, exhibit them. But this trouble is no more than we find in the study of any language whatever.\n\nThe inflections of words are here to be expressed by the common letters. For instance, the same character shall express a filly or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLT\">colt</a>, a horse or a mare, an old horse or an old mare, as accompanied with this or that distinctive letter, which shall show the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, youth, maturity, or old age: a letter also to express the bigness or size of things; thus e.g., a man with this or that letter, to signify a great man, or a little man, &c.\n\nThe use of those letters belongs to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a>; which, once well understood, would abridge the vocabulary exceedingly. An advantage of this grammar is, that it would only have one declension and one conjugation: those numerous anomalies of grammarians are exceeding troublesome; and arise hence, that the common languages are governed by the populace, who never reason on what is best: but in the character here proposed, men of sense having the introduction of it, would have a new ground, whereon to build regularly.\n\nA new universal character has been proposed by Mr Northmore of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, by which different nations may communicate their sentiments to each other. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> plan was, to make the same numerical figure represent the same word in all languages. But he found afterwards that it might be improved, by using a figure not for every word, but every useful word. And even these he thinks might be abbreviated by adopting certain uniform fixed signs, the number of which would not exceed 20, for the various parts of speech. Words of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATION\">negation</a>, he proposed, to be expressed by a prefixed sign. A few instances <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> explain the author's meaning.\n\nSuppose the number 5 to represent the word see,\n\n| Number | Meaning |\n|--------|---------|\n| 6      | a man   |\n| 7      | happy   |\n| 8      | never   |\n| 9      | I       |\n\n\"I...\"\nI would then (says he) express the tenses, genders, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, &c., in all languages, in some such uniform manner as following:\n\n1. \\( \\text{present tense} \\)\n2. \\( \\text{perfect tense} \\)\n3. \\( \\text{perfect participle} \\)\n4. \\( \\text{present participle} \\)\n5. \\( \\text{future} \\)\n6. \\( \\text{substantive} \\)\n7. \\( \\text{<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> substantive} \\)\n8. \\( \\text{nominative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>} \\)\n9. \\( \\text{genitive} \\)\n10. \\( \\text{dative} \\)\n11. \\( \\text{<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMININE\">feminine</a>} \\)\n12. \\( +\\text{plural} \\)\n13. \\( \\text{positive} \\)\n14. \\( \\text{comparative} \\)\n15. \\( \\text{<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERLATIVE\">superlative</a>} \\)\n16. \\( -\\text{negation} \\)\n\nThus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> \\( \\text{plu} \\) be the appellation or the sign of characters, the plural number, six, nine, four, three, plu will be horse.\n\nThus (says our author), I hope, it is evident that about 30 or 40 distinct syllables are sufficient for the above purpose; but I am much mistaken if eleven only will not answer the same end. This is to be done by substituting the first 20 or 30 numerals for the signs, and saying, as in algebra, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> is in the power of such a number, which may be expressed by the simple word under. Ex. gr. Let 6943 represent the word horse; and suppose 4 to be the sign of the plural number, I would write the word thus, \\( \\text{6943}^4 \\); and pronounce it, fix, nine, four, three, in the power of or under four. By these means eleven distinct appellations would be sufficient, and time and use would much abbreviate the pronunciation.\n\nBut the difficulty is not in inventing the most simple, easy, and commodious character, but in engaging the several nations to use it; there being nothing they agree less in, than the understanding and pursuing their common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>.\n\n3. Literal characters may again be divided, with respect to the nations among whom they have been invented, into Greek characters, Roman characters, Hebrew characters, &c. The Latin character now used through all Europe, was formed from the Greek, as the Greek was from the Phoenician; and the Phoenician, as well as the Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic characters, were formed from the ancient Hebrew, which subsisted till the Babylonish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a>; for after that event the character of the Assyrians, which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> Hebrew now in use, prevailed, the ancient being only found on some Hebrew medals, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called Samaritan medals. It was in 1091 that the Gothic characters, invented by Ulfila, were abolished, and the Latin ones established in their room.\n\nMedallists observe, that the Greek character, consisting only of majuscule letters, has preserved its uniformity on all medals, as low as the time of Gallienus, from which time it appears somewhat weaker and rounder: from the time of Constantine to Michael we find only Latin characters: after Michael, the Greek characters recommence; but from that time they began to alter with the language, which was a mixture of Greek and Latin. The Latin medals preserved both their characters and language as low as the translation of the seat of the empire to Constantinople: towards the time of Decius the character began to lose its roundness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>; some time after, it retrieved and subsisted tolerably till the time of Justin, when it degenerated gradually into the Gothic. The rounder, then, and better formed a character is upon a medal, the fairer pretence it has to antiquity.\n\nII. Numerical Characters, or characters used to express numbers, are either letters or figures.\n\nThe Arabic character, called also the common one, because it is used almost throughout Europe in all sorts of calculations, consists of these ten digits, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0.\n\nThe Roman numeral character consists of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> majuscule letters of the Roman alphabet, viz. I, V, X, L, C, D, M. The I denotes one, V five, X ten, L fifty, C a hundred, D five hundred, and M a thousand. The I repeated twice makes two, II; thrice, three,\nCharacters, three, III. Four is expressed thus, IV. as I before V or X takes an unit from the number expressed by these letters. To express six, an I is added to a V, VI.; for seven, two, VII.; and for eight, three, VIII. Nine is expressed by an I before X, thus, IX. The same remark may be made of the X before L or C, except that the diminution is by tens; thus, XL denotes forty, XC ninety, and LX sixty. The C before D or M diminishes each by a hundred. The number five hundred is sometimes expressed by an I before a C <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a>, thus, IO; and instead of M, which signifies a thousand, an I is sometimes used between two C's, the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a>, and the other inverted, thus, CID. The addition of C and O before or after raises CID by tens; thus, CCIDO expresses ten thousand, CCCIDO a hundred thousand. The Romans also expressed any number of thousands by a line drawn over any numeral less than a thousand; thus, V denotes five thousand, LX sixty thousand; so likewise MM is one million, MMM is two millions, &c.\n\nThe Greeks had three ways of expressing numbers:\n\n1. Every letter, according to its place in the alphabet, denoted a number, from \u03b1, one, to \u03c9, twenty-four.\n2. The alphabet was divided into eight units, \u03b1 one, \u03b2 two, \u03b3 three, &c.; into eight tens, \u03b9 ten, \u03ba twenty, \u03bb thirty, &c.; and eight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a>, \u03bf one hundred, \u03c0 two hundred, \u03c1 three hundred, &c.\n3. I stood for one, \u03a0 five, \u0394 ten, \u0397 a hundred, \u03a7 a thousand, \u039c ten thousand; and when the letter \u03a0 enclosed any of these, except I, it showed the enclosed letter to be five times its value; as, [\u03b1] fifty, [\u03b9] five hundred, [\u03ba] five thousand, [\u03bb] fifty thousand.\n\nThe French Characters used in the chamber of accounts, and by persons concerned in the management of the revenue, is properly speaking, nothing else than the Roman numerals, in letters that are not majuscule: thus, instead of expressing fifty-six by LVI, they denote it by smaller characters, lvj.\n\nIII. Characters of Abbreviations, &c. In several of the arts, are symbols contrived for the more concise and immediate conveyance of the knowledge of things. For the\n\nCharacters used in Algebra, see Algebra, Introduction.\n\nOf the Aspects.\n\n\u03b4 or S Conjunction \u25b3 Trine\nSS Semiflexible Bq Biquintile\n* Sextile Vc Quincunx\nQ Quintile o Opposition\n\u25a1 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTILE\">Quartile</a> Q Dragon\u2019s head\nTd Tredecile S Dragon\u2019s tail\n\nOf Time.\n\nA.

The importance of a good character in the commerce of life seems to be universally acknowledged.\u2014To those who are to make their own way either to wealth or honours, a good character is usually no less necessary than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> and abilities. To transcribe the observation of an elegant moralist: though human nature is degenerate, and corrupts itself still more by its own inventions; yet it usually retains to the last an esteem for excellence. But even if we are arrived at such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> degree of depravity as to have lost our native reverence for virtue; yet a regard to our own interest and safety, which we seldom lose, will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to apply for aid, in all important transactions, to men whose character integrity is unimpeached. When we choose an assistant, a partner, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a>, our first inquiry is concerning his character. When we have occasion for a counsellor or attorney, a physician or apothecary, whatever we may be ourselves, we always choose to trust our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> and persons to men of the best character. When we fix on the tradesmen who are to supply us with necessaries, we are not determined by the sign of the lamb, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLF\">wolf</a>, or the fox; nor by a shop fitted up in the most elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>; but by the fairest reputation. Look into a daily newspaper, and you will see, from the highest to the lowest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, how important the characters of the employed appear to the employers. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVERTISEMENT\">advertisement</a> has enumerated the qualities required in the person wanted, there constantly follows, that none need apply who cannot bring an undeniable character. Offer yourself as a candidate for a seat in parliament, be promoted to honour and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a>, or in any respect attract the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of mankind upon yourself, and if you are vulnerable in your character, you will be deeply wounded. This is a general testimony in favour of honesty, which no writings and no practices can possibly refute.\n\nYoung men, therefore, whose characters are yet unfixed, and who consequently may render them just such as they wish, ought to pay great attention to the first steps which they take on entrance into life. They are usually careless and inattentive to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>. They pursue their own plans with ardour, and neglect the opinions which others entertain of them. By some thoughtless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, they suffer a mark to be impressed upon them, which scarcely any subsequent merit can entirely erase. Every man will find some persons, who, though they are not professed enemies, yet view him with an envious or a jealous eye, and who will gladly revive any tale to which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> has given the slightest foundation.\n\nIn this turbulent and confused <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>, where our words and actions are often misunderstood, and oftener misrepresented, it is indeed difficult even for innocence and integrity to avoid reproach, abuse, contempt, and hatred. These not only hurt our interest and impede our advancement in life, but forcibly afflict the feelings of a tender and delicate mind. It is then the part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> first to do every thing in our power to preserve an irreproachable character, and then to let our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> depend chiefly on the approbation of our own consciences, and on the advancement of our interest in a world where liars shall not be believed, and where slanderers shall receive countenance from none but him who, in Greek, is called, by way of eminence, Diabolus, or the calumniator.\n\nCharacter, in Poetry, particularly the epopee and drama, is the result of the manners or peculiarities by which each person is distinguished from others.\n\nThe poetical character, says M. Boffu, is not properly any particular virtue or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of several which are mixed together, in a different degree, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> and the unity of the action; there must be one, however, to reign over all the rest; and this must be found, in some degree, in every part. The first quality in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACHILLES\">Achilles</a>, is wrath; in Ulysses, dissimulation; and in Aeneas,\nCharacter, \u00c6neas, mildness: but as these characters cannot be alone, they must be accompanied with others to embellish them, as far as they are capable, either by hiding their defects, as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> of Achilles, which is palliated by extraordinary valour; or by making them centre in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> virtue, as in Ulysses, whose dissimulation makes a part of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>; and in \u00c6neas, whose mildness is employed in a submission to the will of the gods. In the making up of which union, it is to be observed, the poets have joined together such qualities as are by nature the most compatible; valour with anger, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> with mildness, and prudence with dissimulation. The fable required prudence in Ulysses, and piety in \u00c6neas; in this, therefore, the poets were not left to their choice: but Homer might have made Achilles a coward without abating any thing from the justness of this fable; so that it was the necessity of adorning his character, that obliged him to make him valiant: the character, then of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> in the epic poem, is compounded of three sorts of qualities; the first essential to the fable; the second, embellishments of the first; and valour, which sustains the other two, makes the third.\n\nUnity of character is as necessary as the unity of the fable. For this purpose a person should be the same from the beginning to the end: not that he is always to betray the same sentiments, or one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>; but that he should never speak nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> inconsistently with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> character. For instance, the weak may sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into a warmth, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> of the passionate be calm, a change which often introduces in the drama a very affecting variety: but if the natural disposition of the former was to be represented as boisterous, and that of the latter mild and soft, they would both act out of character, and contradict their persons.\n\nTrue characters are such as we truly and really see in men, or may exist without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> to nature: no man questions but there have been men as generous and as good as \u00c6neas, as passionate and as violent as Achilles, as prudent and wise as Ulysses, as impious and atheistical as Mezentius, and as amorous and passionate as Dido; all these characters, therefore, are true, and nothing but just imitations of nature. On the contrary, a character is false when an author foists it, that one can see nothing like it in the order of nature wherein he designs it shall stand: these characters should be wholly excluded from a poem, because transgressing the bounds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> and reason, they meet with no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> from the readers; they are fictions of the poet's brain, not imitations of nature; and yet all poetry consists of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of nature.\n\nCharacter is also used for certain visible qualities, which claim respect or reverence to those vested therein.\u2014The majesty of kings gives them a character which procures respect from the people. A bishop should sustain his character by learning and solid piety, rather than by worldly lustre, &c. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW_OF_NATIONS\">law of nations</a> secures the character of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> from all insults.\n\nCharacter, among naturalists, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of the genera of animals, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, &c.\n\nCharacteristic, in general, is that which characterizes a thing or person, i.e. constitutes its character, whereby it is distinguished. See Characteristic, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARADE\">Charade</a>.\n\nCharacteristic, is peculiarly used in grammar, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> letter of a word: which is preserved in most of its tenors and moods, its derivatives and compounds.\n\nCharacteristic of a Logarithm, is its index or exponent. See Logarithm.\n\nCharacteristic Triangle of a Curve, in the higher geometry, is a rectilinear right-angled triangle, whose hypotenuse makes a part of the curve, not sensibly different from a right line. It is so called, because curve lines are used to be distinguished hereby. See Curve.\n\nCharade, the name of a new species of composition or literary amusement. It owes its name to the idler who invented it. Its subject must be a word of two syllables, each forming a distinct word: and these two syllables are to be concealed in an enigmatical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, first separately, and then together. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of charades, if not greatly instructive, is at least innocent and amusing. At all events, as it has made its way into every fashionable circle, and has employed even Garrick, it will scarcely be deemed unworthy of attention. The fillipines indeed of most that have appeared in the papers under this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>, are not only destitute of all pleasantry in the stating, but are formed in general of words utterly unfit for the purpose. They have therefore been treated with the contempt they deserved. In trifles of this nature, inaccuracy is without excuse.

In a range the 18th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of an inch long, Dr Hook reckoned 150 pores; whence he concludes, that in a charcoal of an inch diameter, there are not less than 5,724,000 pores. It is to this prodigious number of pores, that the blackness of charcoal is owing: for the rays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> striking on the charcoal, are received and absorbed in its pores, instead of being reflected; whence the body must of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> appear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, blackness in a body being no more than a want of reflection. Charcoal was anciently used to distinguish the bounds of estates and inheritances; as being incorruptible, when let very deep within ground. In effect, it preserves itself so long, that there are many pieces found entire in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> tombs of the northern nations. M. Dodart says, there is charcoal made of corn, probably as old as the days of Caesar: he adds, that it has kept so well, that the wheat may be still distinguished from the rye; which he looks on as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of its incorruptibility.\n\nThe operation of charring wood, is performed in the following manner: The wood intended for this purpose is cut into proper lengths, and piled up in heaps near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where the charcoal is intended to be made: when a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of wood is thus prepared, they begin constructing their stacks, for which there are three methods. The first is this: They <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> a proper spot of ground, of about 12 or 15 feet in diameter, near the piles of wood; in the centre of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILLET\">billet</a> of wood, split across at one end and pointed at the other, is fixed with its pointed extremity in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and two pieces of wood inserted through the clefts of the other end, forming four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>; against these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> pieces four other billets of wood are placed, one end on the ground, and the other leaning against the angles. This being finished, a number of large and straight billets are laid on the ground to form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>, each being as it were the radius of the circular area: on this floor a proper quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> or small wood is strewed, in order to fill up the interstices, when the floor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be complete; and in order to keep the billets in the same order and position in which they were first arranged, pegs or stumps are driven into the ground in the circumference of the circle, about a foot distant from one another: upon this floor a flage is built with billets set upon one end, but something inclining towards the central billet; and on the tops of these another floor is laid in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, but of shorter billets, as the whole is, when finished, to form a cone.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> the stacks for making charcoal is performed in this manner: A long pole is erected in the centre of the area above described, and several small billets ranged round the pole on their ends: the interstices between these billets and the pole is filled with dry brushwood, then a floor is laid, on that a stage in a reclining position, and on that a second floor, &c. in the same manner as described above; but in the lower floor there is a billet larger and longer than the rest, extending from the central\nCharcoal, central pole to some distance beyond the circumference of the circle.\n\nThe third method is this: A chimney, or aperture of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> form, is built with billets in the centre, from the bottom to the top; and round these, floors and inclined stages are erected, in the same manner as in the stacks above described, except that the base of this, instead of being circular like the others, is square; and the whole stack, when completed, forms a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a>.\n\nThe stack of either form being thus finished, is coated over with turf, and the surface plastered with a mixture of earth and charcoal dust well tempered together.\n\nThe next operation is the setting the stack on fire. In order to this, if it be formed according to the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, the central billet in the upper stage is drawn out, and some pieces of very dry and combustible wood are placed in the void space, called, by workmen, the chimney, and fire set to these pieces. If the stack be built according to the second construction, the central pole is drawn out, together with the large horizontal billet above described; and the void space occupied by the latter being filled with pieces of very dry combustible wood, the fire is applied to it at the base of the stack. With regard to the third construction, the square aperture or chimney is filled with small pieces of very dry wood, and the fire applied to it at the top or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APEX\">apex</a> of the pyramidal stack. When the stack is set on fire, either at the top or bottom, the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> is necessary in the workman; for in the proper management of the fire the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> difficulty attending the art of making good charcoal consists. In order to this, care is taken, as soon as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> begins to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> some height above the chimney, that the aperture be covered with a piece of turf, but not so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> as to hinder the smoke from puffing out; and whenever the smoke appears to issue very thick from any part of the pile, the aperture must be covered with a mixture of earth and charcoal dust. At the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, as it is necessary that every part of the stack should be equally burnt, it will be requisite for the workman to open vents in one part and shut them in another. In this manner the fire must be kept up till the charcoal be sufficiently burnt, which will happen in about two days and a half if the wood be dry; but if green, the operation will not be finished in less than three days. When the charcoal is thought to be sufficiently burnt, which is easily known from the appearance of the smoke, and the flames no longer issuing with impetuosity through the vents; all the apertures are to be closed up very carefully with a mixture of earth and charcoal dust, which, by excluding all access of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, prevents the coals from being any further consumed, and the fire goes out of itself. In this condition it is suffered to remain, till the whole is sufficiently cooled; when the cover is removed, and the charcoal is taken away. If the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> is skilfully managed, the coals will exactly retain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of the pieces of wood: some are said to have been so dexterous as to char an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARROW\">arrow</a> without altering even the figure of the feather.\n\nThere are considerable differences in the coals of different vegetables, in regard to their habitu to fire: the very light coals of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, cotton, some fungi, &c., readily catch fire from a spark, and soon burn out; the more dense ones of woods and roots are set on fire more difficulty, and burn more slowly: the coals of the black berry-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> alder, of the hazel, the willow, and the lime tree, are said to answer best for the making of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a> and other pyrotechnical compositions, perhaps from their being easily inflammable: for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of metallic calces those of the heavier woods, as the oak and the beech, are preferable, these seeming to contain a larger proportion of the phlogistic principle, and that, perhaps, in a more fixed state; considered as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> fuel, those of the heavy woods give the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, and require the most plentiful supply of air to keep them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>; those of the light woods prefer a glowing heat, without much draught of air, till the coals themselves are consumed; the bark <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> crackles and flies about in burning, which the coal of the wood itself very seldom does.\n\nMathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> makers, engravers, &c., find charcoal of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> to polish their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> plates after they have been rubbed clean with powdered pumice <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>. Plates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">horn</a> are polishable in the same way, and a glost may be afterwards given with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIPOLI\">tripoli</a>.\n\nThe coals of different substances are also used as pigments; hence the bone-black, ivory-black, &c., of the shops. Most of the paints of this kind, besides their incorruptibility, have the advantage of a full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> freely in all the forms in which powdery pigments are applied; provided they have been carefully prepared, by thoroughly burning the subject in a close vessel, and afterwards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> the coal into a powder of due fineness. Pieces of charcoal are used also in their entire state for tracing the outlines of drawings, &c.; in which intention they have an excellence, that their mark is easily wiped out. For these purposes, either the finer pieces of common charcoal are picked out and cut to a proper shape; or the pencils are formed of wood, and afterwards burnt into charcoal in a proper vessel well covered. The artists commonly make choice of the smaller branches of the tree freed from the bark and pith; and the willow and vine are preferred to all others. This choice is confirmed by the experiments of Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEWIS\">Lewis</a>, who has found that the wood of the trunks of trees produces charcoal of a harder <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> than their small twigs or branches; and the hard woods, such as box and guaiacum, produced coals very sensibly harder than the softer woods. Willow he prefers to all others. The shells and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> yielded coals so hard that they would scarce mark on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> at all; while the coals of the kernels of fruits were quite soft and mellow. The several coals produced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a>'s experiments were levigated into fine powder, mixed both with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, and applied as paints both thin and thick, and diluted with different degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>. All of them, when laid on thick, appeared of a strong full black, nor could it be judged that one was of a finer colour than another; diluted with white, or when spread thin, they had all somewhat of a bluish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>.\n\nHorns and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> both of fishes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> animals, gave coals rather glossier and deeper coloured than vegetables; and which, in general, were very hard, so as difficultly, or not at all, to stain paper. Here also\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> of the coal seemed to depend on that of the subject from whence it was prepared; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, woollen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>, blood, and the fleecy parts of animals, yielded soft coals. Some of these differed from others very sensibly in colour; that of ivory is superior to all the rest, and indisputably the finest of all the charcoal blacks. The animal coals had much less of the bluish cast in them than the vegetable, many of them inclining rather to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>. Charred pit coal, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, seemed to have this blueness in a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>.

Every chariot carried two men, who were probably the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a> and the charioteer; and we read of several men of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> and valour employed in driving the chariot. When the warriors came to encounter in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> fight, they alighted out of the chariot, and fought on foot; but when they were weary, which often happened by reason of their armour, they retired into their chariot, and thence annoyed their enemies with darts and missile weapons. These chariots were made so strong, that they lasted for several generations.\n\nBesides this sort, we find frequent mention of the currus falcati, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> those chariots armed with hooks or scythes, with which whole ranks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> were cut off together, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they had not the art of avoiding the danger; these were not only used by the Persians, Syrians, Egyptians, &c., but we find them among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a>\ncient Britons; and notwithstanding the imperfect state of some of the most necessary arts among that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> before the invasion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, it is certain that they had war chariots in great abundance. By the Greek and Roman historians, these chariots are described by the six following names: viz. Benna, Petoritum, Currus or Carrus, Covinus, Efedum, and Rheda. The benna seems to have been a chariot designed rather for travelling than war. It contained two persons, who were called combennones, from their fitting together in the same machine. The petoritum seems to have been a larger kind of chariot than the benna; and is thought to have derived its name from the British word ped-war, signifying four; this kind of carriage having four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a>. The currus or currus was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CART\">cart</a> or waggon. This kind of chariot was used by the ancient Britons, in times of peace, for the purposes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> and merchandise, and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of war, for carrying their baggage, and wives and children, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> followed the armies of all the Celtic nations. The covinus was a war chariot, and a very terrible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of destruction; being armed with sharp scythes and hooks for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> and tearing all who were so unhappy as to come within its reach. This kind of chariot was made very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, and had few or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> men in it besides the charioteer; being designed to drive with great force and rapidity, and to do execution chiefly with its hooks and scythes. The efedum and rheda were also war chariots, probably of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> size, and stronger made than the covinus, designed for containing a charioteer for driving it, and one or two warriors for fighting. The far greatest number of the British war chariots seem to have been of this kind. These chariots, as already observed, were to be found in great numbers among the Britons; insomuch that Caesar relates, that Cassibelanus, after dismissing all his other forces, retained no fewer than 4000 of these war chariots about his person. The same author relates, that, by continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, they had at last arrived at such perfection in the management of their chariots, that \"in the most steep and difficult places they could stop their horses upon full stretch, turn them which way they pleased, run along the pole, rest on the harness, and throw themselves back into their chariots, with incredible dexterity.\"\n\nChariots, in the heathen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-MYTHOLOGY\">mythology</a>, were sometimes consecrated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>; and the Scripture observes, that Josiah burnt those which had been offered to the sun by the kings his predecessors. This superstitious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the heathens, and principally of the Persians, who had horses and chariots consecrated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the sun. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a>, Xenophon, and Quintus Curtius, speak of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> chariots crowned, which were consecrated to the sun, among the Persians, which in their ceremonies were drawn by white horses consecrated to the same luminary.\n\nTriumphal Chariot, was one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> ornaments of the Roman celebration of a victory.\n\nThe Roman triumphal chariot was generally made of ivory, round like a tower, or rather of a cylindrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>; it was sometimes gilt at the top, and ornamented with crowns; and to represent a victory more naturally, they used to slay it with blood. It was usually drawn by four white horses; but oftentimes by lions, elephants, tygers, bears, leopards, dogs, &c.\n\nCharisia, in the heathen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>, a wake, or night festival, instituted in honour of the Graces.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> which Christ hath left us of the proceedings of the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, establishes the obligation of bounty beyond controversy. \"When the Son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">Man</a> shall come in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, and all the holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a> with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory, and before him shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from another.

And inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\" It is not necessary to understand this passage as a literal account of what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> actually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> on that day. Supposing it only a scathing description of the rules and principles by which the Supreme Arbiter of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTINY\">destiny</a> will regulate his decisions, it conveys the same lesson to us; it equally demonstrates of how great value and importance these duties in the fight of God are, and what stress will be laid upon them. The apostles also describe this virtue as propitiating the divine favour in an eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>. And these recommendations have produced their effect. It does not appear that, before the times of Christianity, an infirmary, hospital, or public charity of any kind, existed in the world; whereas most countries in Christendom have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> abounded with these institutions. To which may be added, that a spirit of private liberality seems to flourish amidst the decay of many other virtues; not to mention the legal provision for the poor, which obtains in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and which was unknown and unthought of by the most polished nations of antiquity.\n\nSt Paul adds upon the subject an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>; and which is practicable by all who have anything to give. \"Upon the first day of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> (or any other stated time) let every one of you lay by in store, as God hath prospered him.\" By which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a> may be understood to recommend what is the very thing wanting with most men, the being charitable upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>; that is, from a deliberate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of our fortunes with the reasonable expenses and expectations of our families, to compute what we can spare, and to lay by so much for charitable purposes, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> or other. The mode will be a consideration afterwards.\n\nThe effect which Christianity produced upon some of its converts, was such as might be looked for from a divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> coming with full force and miraculous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> upon the consciences of mankind. It overwhelmed all worldly considerations in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of a more important existence. \"And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>; neither said any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things in common.\u2014Neither was there any among them that lacked; for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, and laid them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> at the apostles feet; and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.\" Acts iv. 32.\n\nNevertheless, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> of goods, however it manifested the sincere zeal of the primitive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, is no precedent for our imitation. It was confined to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>; continued not long there; was never enjoined upon any (Acts v. 4); and, although it might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> with the particular circumstances of a small and select <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, is altogether impracticable in a large and mixed community.\n\nThe conduct of the apostles upon the occasion deserves to be noticed. Their followers laid down their fortunes at their feet; but so far were they from taking advantage of this unlimited confidence to enrich themselves or establish their authority, that they soon after got rid of this business as inconsistent with the main <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of their mission, and transferred the custody and management of the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> to deacons elected to that office by the people at large (Acts vi.)\n\nThere are three kinds of charity, our author observes, which prefer a claim to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>.\n\n1. The first, and apparently one of the best, is to give stated and considerable sums, by way of pension or annuity to individuals or families, with whose behaviour and distresses we ourselves are acquainted. In speaking of considerable sums, it is meant only, that five pounds, or any other sum, given at once or divided amongst five or fewer families, will do more good than the same sum distributed amongst a greater number in shillings or half crowns; and that, because it is more likely to be properly applied by the persons who receive it. A poor fellow who can find no better <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a> than to drink his benefactor's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, and purchase half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>'s recreation for himself, would hardly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUINEA\">guinea</a> for any such purpose, or be so improvident as not to lay it by for an occasion of importance, for his rent, his clothing, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>, or stock of winter's provision. It is a still greater recommendation of this kind of charity, that pensions and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNUITIES\">annuities</a>, which are paid regularly, and can be expected at the time, are the only way by which we can prevent one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a poor man's sufferings, the dread of want.\n\n2. But as this kind of charity supposes that proper objects of such expensive benefactions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> within our private knowledge and observation, which does not happen to all, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> method of doing good, which is in every one's power who has the money to spare, is by subscription to public charities. Public charities admit of this argument in their favour, that your money goes farther towards attaining the end for which it is given, than it can do by any private and separate beneficence. A guinea, for example, contributed to an infirmary, becomes the means of providing one patient, at least, with a physician, surgeon, apothecary, with medicine, diet, lodging, and suitable attendance; which is not the tenth part of what the same affluence, if it could be procured at all, would cost to a sick person or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> in any other situation.\n\n3. The last, and, compared with the former, the lowest exertion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, is in the relief of beggars. Nevertheless, the indiscriminate rejection of all who implore our alms, in this way, is by no means approved.","sp":424,"ep":426},{"h":"CIVIL","t":"is defined by some a fallacious kind of reason, carrying some resemblance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, which a person, knowing its falsehood, advances in dispute for the sake of victory.

The image will appear of the same size, and in the same position as the object.\n\n3.) Every such mirror will reflect the image of an object of twice its own length and breadth.\n\n4.) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the object be an opaque body, and its rays <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> on the mirror nearly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> lines, there will be only one image visible, which will be reflected by the inner surface of the glass. But,\n\n5.) If the object be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> body, and its rays fall very obliquely on the mirror, there will appear to an eye placed in a proper position, several images; the first of which reflected from the outer surface of the glass, will not be so bright as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, reflected from the inner surface. The following images, that are produced by the repeated reflections of the rays between the two surfaces of the glass, will be in proportion less vivid, to the eighth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> tenth, which will be scarce visible.\n\nII. In a spherical convex mirror.\n\n1.) The image DF, (fig. 2,), will always appear behind it.\n\n2.) The image will be in the same position as the object.\n\n3.) It will be less than the object.\n\n4.) It will be curved, but not, as the mirror, spherical.\n\n5.) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">Parallel</a> rays falling on this mirror will have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> or image at half the distance of the centre K from the mirror.\n\n6.) In converging rays, the distance of the object must be equal to half the distance of the centre, to make the image appear behind the mirror.\n\n7.) Diverging rays will have their image at less than half the distance of the centre. If the object be placed in the centre of the mirror, its image will appear at one eighth of that distance behind it.\n\nIII. In a spherical concave mirror.\n\n1.) That point where the image appears of the same dimensions as the object, is the centre of that mirror.\n\n2.) Parallel rays will have their focus at one half the distance of the centre.\n\n3.) Converging rays will form an image before the mirror.\n\n4.) In diverging rays, if the object be at less than one-half the distance of the centre, the image will be behind the mirror, erect, curved, and magnified, as DEF, (fig. 3,) but if the distance of the object be greater, the image will be before the mirror, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a> and diminished, as DEF, (fig. 4.)\n\n5.) The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>'s rays falling on a concave mirror, and being parallel, will be collected in a focus at half the distance of its centre, where their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> will be augmented in proportion of the surface of the mirror to that of the focal spot.\n\n6.) If a luminous body be placed in the focus of a concave mirror, its rays being reflected in parallel lines, will strongly enlighten a space of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a> with the mirror, at a great distance. If the luminous object be placed nearer than the focus, its rays will diverge, and consequently enlighten a larger space. It is on this principle that reverberators are constructed.\n\nIV. In all plane and spherical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRRORS\">mirrors</a> the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.\n\nSect. III. Entertaining Experiments.\n\nI. Of all our senses the sight is certainly subject to the greatest illusion. The various writers on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">optics</a> have described a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of instances in which illusions deceives us, and have constantly endeavoured to investigate the causes, to explain their effects, and to reconcile appearance with reality. We every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> discover new phenomena, and doubtless many more are reserved for posterity. It frequently happens, moreover, that a discovery which at first seemed of little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> has led to matters of the highest importance.\n\nTake a glass bottle A (fig. 14,) and fill it with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> to the point B; leave the upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> BC empty, and cork it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> manner. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">Place</a> this bottle opposite a concave mirror, and beyond its focus, that it may appear reversed, and before the mirror (see Sect. II. aph. 3, 4, of a spher. concave mirror,) place yourself still further distant from the bottle, and it will appear to you in the situation, a b c, (fig. 15.)\n\nNow it is remarkable in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> bottle, that the water, which, according to all the laws of catoptrics, and all the experiments made on other objects, should appear at a b, appears on the contrary at b c, and consequently the part a b appears empty.\n\nIf the bottle be inverted and placed before the mirror (as in fig. 16.), its image will appear in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> erect position; and the water, which is in reality at BC, will appear at a b.\n\nIf while the bottle is inverted it be uncorked, and the water run gently out, it will appear, that while the part BC, is emptying, that of a b in the image is filling; and what is likewise very remarkable, as soon as the bottle is empty the illusion ceases, the image also appearing entirely empty. If the bottle likewise be quite full there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> illusion.\n\nIf while the bottle is held inverted, and partly empty, some drops of water fall from the bottom A towards BC, it seems in the image as if there were formed at the bottom of that part a b, bubbles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> that rose from a to b; which is the part that seems full of water. All these phenomena constantly appear.\n\nThe remarkable circumstances in this experiment are, first, not only to see an object where it is not, but also where the image is not; and secondly, that of two objects which are really in its same place, as the surface at one place, and the other at another; and to see the bottle in the place of its image, and the water where neither it nor its image are.\n\nII. Construct a box <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a>, of about a foot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, eight inches","sp":292,"ep":293},{"h":"GL","t":"in the other the tube MF, and observe that in each of these is to be inserted another tube, as H and I (a).\n\nFurnish the first of these tubes with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>-glass at G, and a concave eye-glass at F. You are to observe, that in regulating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> of these glasses, with regard to the length of the tube, you are to suppose it equal to the line G, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> visual pointed ray, which entering at the aperture G, is reflected by the four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRRORS\">mirrors</a>, and goes out at the other aperture F, where the ocular glass is placed. Put any glass you <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> into the two ends of the moveable tubes H and I; and lastly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> the machine on a stand E, moveable at the point S, that it may be elevated or depressed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>.\n\nWhen the eye is placed at F, and you look through the tube, the rays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> that proceed from the object T, passing through the glass G, are successively reflected by the mirrors O, P, Q, and R, to the eye at F, and there paint the object T, in its proper situation, and these rays appear to proceed directly from that object.\n\nThe two moveable tubes H and I, at the extremities of each of which a glass is placed, serve only the more to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> the illusion, for they have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with the interior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the machine. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> being moveable on the stand E, may be directed to any object; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> furnished with proper glasses will answer the purpose of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a>.\n\nThe two moveable tubes H and I being brought together, the machine is directed toward any object, and desiring a person to look at the end F, you ask him if he sees distinctly that object. You then separate the two moveable tubes, and leaving a space between them sufficient to place your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, or any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> body; you tell him that the machine has the power of making objects visible through the most opaque body; and as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> you desire him then to look at the same object, when to his great surprise, he will see it as distinct as when there was no solid body placed between the tubes.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">Note</a>, This experiment is the more extraordinary, as it is very difficult to conceive how the effect is produced. The two arms of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> appearing to be made to support the perspective glass; and to whatever object it is directed, the effect is still the same.\n\nVI. In the partition <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a>, make two apertures, CD, and EF, of a foot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, and ten inches wide, and about a foot distant from each other. Let them be at the common height of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>; and in each of them place a transparent glass, surrounded with a frame, like a common mirror.\n\nBehind this partition place two mirrors H and I, inclined to it in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of forty-five degrees; that is, half way between a line drawn perpendicular to the ground and its surface; let them be both 18 inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>: let all the space between them be enclosed, by boards or pasteboard painted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, and well closed, that no light may enter: let there be also two curtains to cover them, which may be drawn aside at pleasure.\n\nWhen a person looks into one of these supposed mirrors, instead of seeing his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, he will perceive the object that is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the other; so that if two persons present themselves at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> before these mirrors, instead of each one seeing himself, they will reciprocally see each other.\n\nNote, There should be a sconce with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> placed on each side of the two glasses in the wainscot, to enlighten the faces of the persons who look in them, otherwise this experiment will have no remarkable effect.\n\nThis experiment may be considerably improved by placing the two glasses in the partition in adjoining rooms, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of persons being previously placed in one room, when a stranger enters the other, you may tell him his face is dirty; and desire him to look in the glass, which he will naturally do; and on seeing a strange face he will draw back; but returning to it, and seeing another, another, and another, like the phantom kings in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACBETH\">Macbeth</a>, what his surprise will be is more easy to conceive than express. After this, a real mirror may be privately let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> on the back of the glass; and if he can be prevailed to look in it once more, he will then, to his further astonishment, see his own face; and may be told, perhaps persuaded, that all he thought he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> before was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>.\n\nHow many tricks, less artful than this, have passed in former times for sorcery; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> at this time, in some countries, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARITIONS\">apparitions</a>!\n\nNote, When a man looks in a mirror that is placed perpendicular to another, his face will appear entirely deformed. If the mirror be a little inclined, so as to make an angle of 80 degrees (that is, one-ninth part from the perpendicular), he will then see all the parts of his face, except the nose and forehead. If it be inclined to 60 degrees (that is, one-third part), he will appear with three noses and six eyes: in short, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFORMITY\">deformity</a> will vary at each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of inclination; and when the glass comes to 45 degrees (that is, half-way down), the face will vanish. Instead of placing the two mirrors in this situation, they are so disposed that their junction may be vertical, their different inclinations will produce other effects; as the situation of the object relative to these mirrors is quite different. The effects of these mirrors, though remarkable enough, occasions but little surprise, as there is no method of concealing the cause by which they are produced.\n\nVII. Make a box of wood, of a cubical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, Fig. 13, ABCD, of about 15 inches every way. Let it be fixed to the pedestal P, at the usual height of a man's head. In each side of this box, let there be an opening.\n\n(a) These four tubes must terminate in the substance of the case, and not enter the inside, that they may not hinder the effect of the mirrors. The fourfold reflection of the rays of light from the mirrors, darkens in some degree the brightness of the object; some light is also lost by the magnifying power of the perspective: If, therefore, instead of the object-glass at G, and concave eye-glass at F, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> glasses were substituted; the magnifying power of the perspective will be taken away, and the object appear brighter.\ning of an oval form, of ten inches high, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> wide.\n\nIn this box place two mirrors A, D, with their backs against each other; let them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> the box in a diagonal line, and in a vertical position. Decorate the openings in the sides of this box with four oval frames and transparent glases, and cover each of them with a curtain, so contrived that they may all draw up together.\n\nPlace four persons in front of the four sides, and at equal distances from the box, and then draw up the curtains that they may see themselves in the mirrors; when each of them, instead of his own figure, will see that of the person who is next him, and who, at the same time, will seem to him to be placed on the opposite side. Their confusion will be the greater, as it will be very difficult for them to discover the mirrors concealed in the box. The reason of this phenomenon is evident; for though the rays of light may be turned aside by a mirror, yet, as we have before said, they always appear to proceed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>.\n\nVIII. Provide a box ABCD of about two feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, 15 inches wide, and 12 inches high. At the end AC place a concave mirror, the focus of whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> rays is at 18 inches from the reflecting surface. At IL place a pasteboard blacked, in which a hole is cut sufficiently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> to see on the mirror H the object placed at BEFD.\n\nCover the top of the box, from A to I, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>, that the mirror H may be entirely darkened. The other part IB must be covered with a glass, under which is placed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAUZE\">gauze</a>.\n\nMake an aperture at G, near the top of the side EB; beneath which, on the inside, place, in succession, paintings of different subjects, as vistas, landscapes, &c., so that they may be in front of the mirror H. Let the box be so placed that the object may be strongly illuminated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, or by wax lights placed under the enclosed part of the box AI.\n\nBy this simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> the objects placed at GD will be thrown into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> perspective; and if the subjects be properly chosen, the appearance will be altogether as pleasing as in optical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> of a much more complicated form.\n\nNote, A glass mirror should be always here used, as those of metal do not represent the objects with equal vivacity, and are beside subject to tarnish. It is also necessary that the box be sufficiently large, that you may not be obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> a mirror whose focus is too short; for in that case, the right lines near the border of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> will appear bent in the mirror, which will have a disagreeable effect, and cannot be avoided.\n\nIX. To set fire to a combustible body by the reflection of two concave mirrors, fig. 18.\n\nPlace two concave mirrors, A and B, at about 12 or 15 feet distance from each other, and let the axis of each of them be in the same line. In the focus C of one of them, place a live coal, and in the focus D of the other some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>. With a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> bellows, which make a continual blast, keep constantly blowing the coal, and notwithstanding the distance between them, the powder will presently take fire.\n\nIt is not necessary that these mirrors be of metal or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, those made of wood or pasteboard gilded, will produce the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a>, which has sometimes taken effect at the distance of 50 feet, when mirrors of 18 inches, or two feet diameter, have been used.\n\nThis experiment succeeds with more difficulty at great distances; which may proceed from the moisture in a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. It would doubtless take effect more readily, if a tin tube, of an equal diameter with the mirrors, were to be placed between them.\n\nX. Behind the partition AB, place, in a position something oblique, the concave mirror EF, which must appear, be at least ten inches in diameter, and its distance from the partition equal to three-fourths of the distance of its centre.\n\nIn the partition make an opening of seven or eight inches, either square or circular: it must face the mirror, and be of the same height with it. Behind this partition place a strong light, so disposed that it may not be seen at the opening, and may illumine an object placed at C, without throwing any light on the mirror.\n\nBeneath the aperture in the partition place the object C, that you intend shall appear on the outside of the partition, in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a> position; and which we will suppose to be a flower. Before the partition, and beneath the aperture, place a little flowerpot D, the top of which should be even with the bottom of the aperture, that the eye, placed at G, may see the flower in the same position as if its stalk came out of the pot.\n\nTake care to paint the space between the back part of the partition and the mirror black, to prevent any reflections of light from being thrown on the mirror; in a word, so dispose the whole that it may be as little enlightened as possible.\n\nWhen a person is placed at the point G, he will perceive the flower that is behind the partition, at the top of the pot at D; but on putting out his hand to pluck it, he will find that he attempts to grasp a shadow.\n\nIf in the opening of the partition a large double convex <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENS\">lens</a> of a short focus be placed, or, which is not quite so well, a bottle of clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, the image of the flower reflected thereon will appear much more vivid and distinct.","sp":294,"ep":296},{"h":"WHEN THE SENATE OF VENICE WERE DELIBERATING ON THE","t":"n the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> were deliberating on the means to be used for relieving Candia, and endeavouring to equip a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, the Mahometan generals were sacrificing the lives of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> to bring their enterprise to a glorious termination. In different engagements they had already lost 20,000 warriors; but, descending into the ditches, they had undermined the walls, and blown up the most impregnable forts with explosions of powder. They sprung one of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> beneath the bastion of St Demetri. It overturned a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the wall, which crushed all the defenders of the bastion. That instant the besiegers sprung up with their sabres in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and taking advantage of the general consternation of the besieged on that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, made themselves masters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a>. The besieged, recovering from their terror, attacked them with unequalled intrepidity. About 400 men assisted 2000 Turks already firmly posted on the wall, and pressed upon them with such obstinate and dauntless valour, that they killed a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, and drove the rest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> into the ditch. In this extremity, every person\nperson in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> was in arms. The Greek monks took up muskets; and the women, forgetting the delicacy of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, appeared on the walls among the defenders, either supplying the men with ammunition and arms, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> fighting themselves; and several of those daring heroines lost their lives.\n\nFor 50 days the city held out against all the forces of the Turks. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a>, even at the end of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, the Venetians had sent a naval armament to its relief, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of Candia might have been saved. Doubtless, they were not ignorant of this well-known fact. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> blows straight into the harbour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANEA\">Canea</a>. When it blows a little briskly, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> rages. It is then impossible for any squadron of ships, however numerous, to form in line of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> in the harbour, and to meet an enemy. If the Venetians had let out from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CERIGO\">Cerigo</a> with a fair wind, they might have reached Canea in five hours, and might have entered the harbour with full sails, without being exposed to one cannon-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a>; while none of the Turkish ships would have dared to appear before them; or if they had ventured, must have been driven back on the shore, and dashed in pieces among the rocks. But, instead of thus taking advantage of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> circumstances of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, they sent a few galleys, which, not daring to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> Spada, coaled along the southern shore of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, and failed of accomplishing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of their expedition.\n\nAt last, the Caneans, despairing of relief from Venice, seeing three breaches made in their walls, through which the infidels might easily advance upon them, exhausted with fatigue, and covered with wounds, and reduced to the number of 500 men, who were obliged to scatter themselves round the walls, which were half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, and undermined in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, demanded a parley, and offered to capitulate. They obtained very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> conditions; and after a glorious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of two months, which cost the Turks 20,000 men, marched out of the city with the honours of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>. Those citizens, who did not choose to continue in the city, were permitted to remove; and the Ottomans, contrary to their usual practice, faithfully observed their stipulations.\n\nThe Venetians, after the loss of Canea, retired to Retimo. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>-pacha laid siege to the citadel of the Sude, situated in the entrance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>, on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> rock, of about a quarter of a league in circumference. He raised earthen-batteries, and made an ineffectual attempt to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> the ramparts. At last, despairing of taking it by assault, he left some forces to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> it up from all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a>, and advanced towards Retimo. That city, being unwalled, was defended by a citadel, standing on an eminence which overlooks the harbour. General Cornaro had retired thither. At the approach of the enemy, he advanced from the city, and waited for them in the open field. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, inattentive to his own safety, he encouraged the soldiers, by fighting in the ranks. A glorious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> was the reward of his valour; but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> determined the fate of Retimo.\n\nThe Turks having landed additional forces on the island, they introduced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>, which was almost a constant attendant on their armies. This dreadful pest rapidly advanced, and, like a devouring fire, wasting all before it, destroyed most part of the inhabitants. The rest, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> in terror before its ravages, escaped into the Venetian territories, and the island was left almost desolate.\n\nThe siege of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> commenced in 1646, and was protracted much longer than that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a>. Till the year 1648, the Turks scarce gained any advantages before that city. They were often routed by the Venetians, and sometimes compelled to retire to Retimo. At that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> Ibrahim was solemnly deposed, and his eldest son, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> years, was raised to the throne, under the name of Mahomet IV. Not satisfied with confining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SULTAN\">sultan</a> to the horrors and obscurity of a dungeon, the partizans of his son strangled him on the 19th of August, in the same year. That young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, who mounted the throne by the death of his father, was afterwards expelled from it, and condemned to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> the remainder of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> in confinement.\n\nIn the year 1649, Uflein Pacha, who blockaded Candia, receiving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> supplies from the Porte, was compelled to raise the siege, and retreat to Canea. The Venetians were then on the sea with a strong squadron. They attacked the Turkish fleet in the bay of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMYRNA\">Smyrna</a>, burnt 12 of their ships and two gallies, and killed 6000 of their men. Some time after, the Mahometans having found means to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> on Candia, renewed the siege of the city, with greater vigour, and made themselves masters of an advanced fort that was very troublesome to the besieged; which obliged them to blow it up.\n\nFrom the year 1650 till 1658, the Venetians, continuing masters of the sea, intercepted the Ottomans every year in the straits of the Dardanelles, and fought them in four naval engagements; in which they defeated their numerous fleets, sunk a number of their caravels, took others, and extended the terror of their arms even to the walls of Constantinople. That capital became a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of tumult and disorder. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> Signior, alarmed, and trembling for his safety, left the city with precipitation.\n\nSuch glorious success revived the hopes of the Venetians, and depressed the courage of the Turks. They converted the siege of Candia into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCKADE\">blockade</a>, and suffered considerable losses. The sultan, in order to exclude the Venetian fleet from the Dardanelles, and to open his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a> a free and safe passage, caused two fortresses to be built at the entrance of the straits. He gave orders to the pacha of Canea to appear again before the walls of Candia, and to make every possible effort to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> the city. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, the republic of Venice, to improve the advantages which they had gained, made several attempts on Canea. In 1660, that city was about to surrender to their arms, when the pacha of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RHODES\">Rhodes</a>, hastening to its relief, reinforced the defenders with a body of 2000 men. He happily doubled the extremity of Cape Melece, though within sight of the Venetian fleet, which was becalmed off Cape Spada, and could not advance one fathom to oppose an enemy considerably weaker than themselves.\n\nKiopruli, son and successor to the visir of that name, who had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> been the support of the Ottoman empire, knowing that the murmurs of the people against the long continuance of the siege of Candia were rising to a height, and fearing a general revolt, which would\nwould be fatal to himself and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, set out from Byzantium about the end of the year 1666 at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of a formidable army. Having escaped the Venetian fleet, which was lying off Candia with a view to intercept him, he landed at Palio Castro, and formed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> around Candia. Under his command were four pachas, and the flower of the Ottoman forces. These troops, being encouraged by the presence and the promises of their chiefs, and supported by a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>, performed prodigies of valour. All the exterior forts were destroyed. Nothing now remained to the besieged but the bare line of the walls, unprotected by fortresses; and these being battered by an incessant discharge of artillery, soon gave way on all quarters. Still, however, what prowess may perhaps regard as incredible, the Caneans held out three years against all the force of the Ottoman empire. At last they were going to capitulate, when the hope of assistance from France reanimated their valour, and rendered them invincible. The expected succours arrived on the 25th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1669. They were conducted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Noailles. Under his command were a great number of French noblemen, who came to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> of their skill in arms against the Turks.\n\nNext <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> after their arrival, the ardour of the French prompted them to make a general sally. The duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUFORT\">Beaufort</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a> of France, assumed the command of the forlorn hope. He was the first to advance against the Muslims, and was followed by a numerous body of infantry and cavalry. They advanced furiously upon the enemy, attacked them within their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENCHES\">trenches</a>, forced the trenches, and would have compelled them to abandon their lines and artillery, had not an unforeseen accident damped their courage. In the midst of the engagement a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">magazine</a> of powder was set on fire; the foremost of the combatants lost their lives; the French ranks were broken; several of their leaders, among whom was the duke of Beaufort, disappeared forever; the soldiers fled in disorder; and the duke of Noailles, with difficulty, effected a retreat within the walls of Candia. The French accused the Italians of having betrayed them; and on that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> prepared to set off sooner than the time agreed upon. No entreaties of the commandant could prevail with them to delay their departure; so they reembarked. Their departure determined the fate of the city. There were now no more than five hundred men to defend it. Morofini capitulated with Kiopruif, to whom he surrendered the kingdom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRETE\">Crete</a>, excepting only the Sude, Grabula, and Spina-Longua. The grand-vizir made his entrance into Candia on the 4th of October 1670, and laid eight months in that city, inspecting the reparation of its walls and fortresses.\n\nThe three fortresses left in the hands of the Venetians by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a> remained long after in their possession. At last they were all taken, one after another. In short, after a war of 30 years continuance, in the course of which more than 200,000 men fell in the island, and it was deluged with streams of Christian and Mahometan blood, Candia was entirely subdued by the Turks, in whose hands it still continues.\n\nOf the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> of Candia travellers speak with rapture. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> is never excessive; and in the plains violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> is never felt. In the warmest days of Candia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> is cooled by breezes from the sea. Winter properly begins here with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> and ends with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a>; and during that short period snow never falls on the lower grounds, and the surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> is rarely frozen over. Most frequently the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> is as fine then as it is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> at the beginning of June. These two months have received the name of winter, because in them there is a copious fall of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, the sky is obscured with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>, and the north winds blow violently; but the rains are favourable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, the winds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a> the clouds towards the summits of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, where a repository is formed for those waters which are to fertilize the fields; and the inhabitants of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> suffer no inconvenience from these transient blasts. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of February, the ground is overspread with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> and rising crops. The rest of the year is almost one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> fine day. The inhabitants of Crete never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> any of those mortifying returns of piercing cold, which are so frequently felt in Britain and even more southern countries; and which, succeeding suddenly after the chilling heats of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, nip the blossoming flowers, whether the open buds, destroy half the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of the year, and are fatal to delicate constitutions. The sky is always unclouded and serene; the winds are mild and refreshing breezes. The radiant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> proceeds in smiling majesty along the azure vault, and ripens the fruits on the lofty mountains, the rising hills, and the plains. The nights are no less beautiful; their coolness is delicious. The atmosphere not being overloaded with vapours, the sky unfolds to the observer's view a countless profusion of stars; those numerous stars sparkle with the most vivid rays, and fire the azure vault in which they appear fixed, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, with diamonds, and with rubies. Nothing can be more magnificent than this sight, and the Cretans enjoy it for six months in the year.\n\nTo the charms of the climate other advantages are joined which augment their value: There are scarce any morasses in the island; the waters here are never in a state of stagnation; they flow in numberless streams from the tops of the mountains, and form here and there <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> fountains or small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> that empty themselves into the sea; the elevated situation of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> causes them to dash down with such rapidity, that they never lose themselves in pools or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>; consequently insects cannot deposit their eggs upon them, as they would be immediately hurried down into the sea; and Crete is not infested like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> with those clouds of insects which swarm in the housetops, and whose sting is insufferably painful; nor is the atmosphere here loaded with those noxious vapours which rise from marshy grounds.\n\nThe mountains and hills are overspread with various kinds of thyme, savoury, wild thyme, and with a multitude of odoriferous and balsamic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>; the rivulets which flow down the valleys are overhung with myrtles, laurel, and roses; clumps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CITRON\">citron</a>, and almond trees, are plentifully scattered over the fields; the gardens are adorned with tufts of Arabian jasmine. In spring, they are besprewed with beds of violets; some extensive plains are arrayed in saffron; the cavities of the rocks are fringed with sweet smelling dittany. In a word, from the hills, the vales, and the plains,\nplains, on all hands, there arise clouds of exquisite perfumes, which embalm the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and render it a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> to breathe it.\n\nAs to the inhabitants, the Mahometan men are generally from five feet and a half to six feet tall. They bear a strong resemblance to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a>; and it must have been after such models that the ancient artists wrought. The women also are generally beautiful. Their dress does not restrain the growth of any part of their bodies, and their shape therefore assumes those admirable proportions with which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of the Creator has graced his fairest workmanship on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. They are not all handsome or charming; but some of them are beautiful, particularly the Turkish ladies. In general, the Cretan women have a rising throat, a neck gracefully rounded, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> eyes sparkling with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANIMATION\">animation</a>, a small mouth, a fine nose, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a> delicately coloured with the fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMILION\">vermilion</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>. But the oval of their form is different from that of Europeans, and the character of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> is peculiar to their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a> belonging to the island are not of a ferocious temper. There are no lions, tigers, bears, wolves, foxes, or indeed any dangerous animal here. Wild goats are the only inhabitants of the forests that overspread the lofty mountains; and these have nothing to fear but the bow of the hunter; hares inhabit the hills and the plain; sheep graze in security on the thyme and the heath; they are folded every night, and the shepherd sleeps soundly without being disturbed with the fear that wild animals may invade and ravage his folds.\n\nThe Cretans are very happy in not being exposed to the troublesome bite of noxious insects, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a>, or the rapacity of the wild beasts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> believed that the island enjoyed these singular advantages, on account of its having been the birth-place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>. \"The Cretans (says Elian) celebrate in their songs the beneficence of Jupiter, and the favour which he conferred on their island, which was the place of his birth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, by freeing it from every noxious animal, and even rendering it unfit for nourishing those noxious animals that are introduced into it from foreign countries.\n\nDittany holds the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> among the medicinal plants which are produced in Crete. The praises bestowed on the virtues of this plant by the ancients are altogether extravagant; yet we perhaps treat the medicinal virtues of this plant with too much contempt. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> is very balsamic, and its flower diffuses around it a delicious odour. At present the inhabitants of the island apply it with success on various occasions. The leaf, when dried and taken in an infusion with a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, makes a very pleasant drink, of a finer flavour than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>. It is there an immediate cure for a weak stomach, and enables it to recover its tone after a bad digestion.\n\nDiseases are very rare in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> whose atmosphere is exceedingly pure; and in Candia, epidemical diseases are unknown. Fevers prevail here in summer, but are not dangerous; and the plague would be wholly unknown, had not the Turks destroyed the lazarets that were established by the Venetians, for strangers to do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-QUARANTINE\">quarantine</a> in. Since the period when these were demolished, it is occasionally introduced by ships from Smyrna and Constantinople. As no precautions are taken against it, it gains ground, and spreads over the island from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> to another; and as the colds and heats are never intertemperate, it sometimes continues its ravages for six months at a time.\n\nThis fine country is infested with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> somewhat less dangerous than the plague, but whose symptoms are somewhat more hideous; that disease is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEPROSY\">leprosy</a>. In ancient times, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a> was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> in which it raged with most fury; and from Syria it was carried into several of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> of the Archipelago. It is infectious, and is instantaneously communicated by contact. The victims who are attacked by it, are driven from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, and confined to little ruinous hovels on the high way. They are strictly forbidden to leave these miserable dwellings, or hold intercourse with any person. Those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> wretches have generally beside their huts a small garden producing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a>, and feeding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a>; and with that support, and what they obtain from passers-by, they find means to drag out a painful life in circumstances of shocking bodily distress. Their bloated skin is covered with a scaly crust, speckled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> spots; which afflict them with intolerable itchings. A hoarse and tremulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> issues from the bottom of their breasts. Their words are scarce articulated; because their distemper inwardly preys upon the organs of speech. These frightful spectres gradually lose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>. They continue to breathe till such time as the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of their blood is corrupted, and their bodies entirely in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>. The rich are not attacked by this distemper: it confines itself to the poor, chiefly to the Greeks. But those Greeks observe strictly their four lentils; and eat nothing during that time but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> fish, botargo salted and smoked, pickled olives, and cheese. They drink plentifully of the hot and muddy wines of the island. The natural tendency of such a regimen must be, to fire the blood, to thicken the fluid part of it, and thus at length to bring on a leprosy.\n\nCandia is at present governed by three pachas, who reside respectively at Candia, Canca, and Retimo. The first, who is always a pacha of three tails, may be considered as viceroy of the island. He enjoys more extensive powers than the others. To him the inspection of the forts and arsenals is intrusted. He nominates to such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> employments as fall vacant, as well as to the governments of the Sude, Grabusa, Spina Longua, and Gira-petra. The governors of these forts are denominated beys. Each of them has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTABLE\">constable</a> and three general officers under him: one of whom is commander of the artillery; another of the cavalry; and the third of the janissaries.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of the pacha consists of a kyaia, who is the channel through which all orders are issued, and all favours bestowed; an aga of the janissaries, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLONEL\">colonel</a>-general of the troops, who has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> care of the regulation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a>; two topigli bachi; a defterdar, who is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a>-general for the imperial revenues; a keeper of the imperial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>; and the chief officers of the army. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> is entirely military, and the power of the pacha s\u00e9rifquier is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> of his sentences is never called in question; they are instantly carried into execution.\nThe people of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> are the mufti, who is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> head, and the cadi. The first interprets those laws which regard the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the patrimony among the children of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, successions, and marriages,\u2014in a word, all that are contained in the Koran; and he also decides on every thing that relates to the ceremonies of the Mussulman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. The cadi cannot pronounce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> on affairs connected with these laws, without first taking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of the mufti in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, which is named Faifa. It is his business to receive the declarations, complaints, and donations of private persons; and to decide on such differences as arise among them. The pacha is obliged to consult those judges when he puts a Turk legally to death; but the pacha, who is dignified with three tails, sets himself above all laws, condemns to death, and sees his sentence executed, of his own proper authority. All the malques have their imam, a kind of curate, whose duty is to perform the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. There are schoolmasters in the different quarters of the city. These persons are much respected in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a>, and are honoured with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of effendi.\n\nThe garrison of Candia consists of 46 companies, composing a military force of about ten thousand men. All these forces do not reside constantly in the city, but they may be quartered in a very short time. They are all regularly paid every three months, excepting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JANIZARIES\">janizaries</a>, none of whom but the officers receive pay. The different gradations of this military body do not depend on the pacha. The council of each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>, consisting of veterans, and of officers in actual service, has the power of naming to them. A person can occupy the same post for no longer than two years; but the post of forbayz, or captain, which is purchased at Constantinople, is held for life. The oula, or cook, is also continued in his employment as long as the company to which he belongs is satisfied with him. Each company has its almoner, denominated imam.\n\nThe garrisons of Canea and Retimo, formed on a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, are much less numerous. The first consists of about 3000 men, the other of 500; but as all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> children of the Turks are enrolled among the janizaries as soon as born, the number of these troops might be greatly augmented in time of war; but, to say the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, they are far from formidable. Most of them have never seen fire, nor are they ever exercised in military evolutions.\n\nThe pachas of Canea and Retimo are no less absolute, within the bounds of their respective provinces, than the pacha of Candia. They enjoy the same privileges with him, and their council consists of the same officers. These governors chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> is to get rich as speedily as possible; and in order to accomplish that end, they practise all the arts and cruelties of oppression, to squeeze <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> from the Greeks. In truth, those poor wretches run to meet the chains with which they are loaded. Envy, which always preys upon them, continually prompts them to take up arms. If some one among them happen to enjoy a decent fortune, the rest assiduously seek some pretence for accusing him before the pacha, who takes advantage of these divisions, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of both the parties. It is by no means astonishing, that under so barbarous a government, the number of the Greeks is daily diminished.\n\nThere are scarcely in the island, 65,000 of whom pay the carach.\n\nThe Turks have not possessed the island for more than 120 years; yet, as they are not exposed to the same oppression, they have multiplied in it, and raised themselves upon the ruin of the ancient inhabitants. Their number amounts to 200,000 Turks.\n\nThe Jews, of whom there are not many in the island, amount only to 200.\n\nTotal is 350,200 souls.\n\nThis fertile country is in want of nothing but industrious husbandmen, secure of enjoying the fruit of their labours. It might maintain four times its present number of inhabitants.\n\nAntiquity has celebrated the island of Crete as containing 100 populous cities; and the industry of geographers has preserved their names and situations. Many of these cities contained no fewer than 30,000 inhabitants\u2014and by reckoning them, on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a>, at 6000 each, we shall in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> be rather within than beyond the truth. This calculation gives for 100 cities 600,000\n\nBy allowing the same number as inhabitants of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, villages, and all the rest of the island,\n\nthe whole number of the inhabitants of ancient Crete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> amount to 1,200,000\n\nThis number cannot be exaggerated. When Candia was in the hands of the Venetians, it was reckoned to contain nine hundred fourscore and fifteen villages.\n\nIt appears, therefore, that when the island of Crete enjoyed the blessing of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, it maintained to the number of 849,800 more inhabitants than it does at present. But since those happier times, she has been deprived of her laws by the tyranny of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>; has groaned under the destructive sway of the monarchs of the lower empire; has been exposed for a period of 120 years to the ravages of the Arabians; has next passed under the dominion of the Venetians; and has at last been subjected to the despotism of the Turks, who have produced a dreadful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPOPULATION\">depopulation</a> in all the countries which have been subdued by their arms.\n\nThe Turks allow the Greeks the free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of their religion, but forbid them to repair their churches or monasteries; and accordingly they cannot obtain permission to repair their places of worship, or religious houses, but by the powerful influence of gold. From this article the pachas derive very considerable sums. They have 12 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> as formerly, the first of whom assumes the title of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of Gortynia. He resides at Candia; in which city the metropolitan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of the island stands. He is appointed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a> of Constantinople; and has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of nominating to all the other bishoprics of the island; the names of which are, Gortynia, Cnolou, Mirabella, Hyera, Gira-petra, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCADIA\">Arcadia</a>, Cherronele, Lambis, Milopotamo, Retimo, Canea, Cifamo. These bishoprics are nearly the same as under the reign of the Greek emperors.\nCandia. The patriarch wears a triple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIARA\">tiara</a>, writes his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIGNATURE\">signature</a> in red <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INK\">ink</a>, and answers for all the debts of the clergy. To enable him to fulfill his engagements, he lays impositions on the rest of the bishops, and particularly on the monasteries, from which he draws very handsome contributions. He is considered as the head of the Greeks, whom he protects, as far as his slender <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> goes. The orders of government are directed to him on important occasions; and he is the only one of all the Greeks in the island who enjoys the privilege of entering the city on horseback.\n\nCandia, is the capital of the above island, situated on its northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, in E. Long. 25\u00b0 O. N. Lat. 35\u00b0 30'. It stands on the same situation which was formerly occupied by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HERACLEA\">Heraclea</a>, and is the seat of government under the Turks. Its walls, which are more than a league in compass, are in good repair, and defended by deep ditches, but not protected by any exterior fort. Towards the sea, it has no attacks to fear; because the shallowness of the harbour renders it inaccessible to ships of war.\n\nThe Porte generally commits the government of this island to a pasha of three tails. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> officers, and several bodies of the Ottoman soldiery, are stationed here. This city, when under the Venetians, was opulent, commercial, and populous; but it has now lost much of its former strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>. The harbour, naturally a fine basin, in which ships were securely sheltered from every storm, is every day becoming narrower and shallower. At present it admits only boats, and small ships after they have discharged a part of their freight. Those vessels, which the Turks freight at Candia, are obliged to go almost empty to the port of Stamboul, whither their cargoes are conveyed to them in barks. Such inconveniences are highly unfavourable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>; and as government never thinks of removing them, the trade of Candia is therefore considerably decayed.\n\nCandia, which was embellished by the Venetians with regular streets, handsome houses, a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, and a magnificent cistern, contains at present but a small number of inhabitants, notwithstanding the vast extent of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> enclosed within its walls. Several divisions of the city are void of inhabitants. That in which the market-place stands is the only one which discovers any stir of business, or show of affluence. The Mahometans have converted most of the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> into mosques; yet they have left two churches to the Greeks, one to the Armenians, and a synagogue to the Jews. The Capuchins possess a small convent, with a chapel in which the vice-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a> of France hears mass. At present he is the only Frenchman who attends it, as the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> have taken up their residence at Canea.\n\nWest of the city of Candia is an extensive range of hills, which are a continuation of Mount Ida, and of which the extremity forms the promontory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DION\">Dion</a>. On the way to Dion, we find Palio Castro, on the shore; a name which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> Greeks give indifferently to all remains of ancient cities. Its situation corresponds to that of the ancient Panormus, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a> north-west from Heraclea.\n\nThe river which runs west of Candia was anciently known by the name of Triton; near the source of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a> sprung from the brain of Jove. Loaxus is a little farther distant. About a league east of that city, the river Ceratus flows through a delightful vale. According to Strabo, in one part of its course it runs near by Gnoffus. A little beyond that, is another river supposed to be Therenus, on the banks of which, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> relates that Jupiter consummated his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> with Juno. For the space of more than half a league round the walls of Candia there is not a single tree to be seen. The Turks cut them all down in the time of the siege, and laid waste the gardens and orchards. Beyond that extent, the country is plentifully covered with corn and fruit trees. The neighbouring hills are overgrown with vineyards, which produce the malmsey of Mount Ida,\u2014worthy of preference at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> of the most exquisite connoisseur in wines. That <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of wine, though little known, has a fine flavour, a very pleasant relish, and is highly esteemed in the island.","sp":131,"ep":136}]
