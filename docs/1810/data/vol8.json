Not only purges, which are very commonly administered in this way, but also every class of remedies, may be exhibited in the form of a clyster. The clyster should be composed of no substances that are not either entirely soluble in water, or may be thoroughly mixed with any watery fluid, as to pass readily through a slender tube.\n\nThe instrument employed for administering a clyster is, as in the human subject, a pipe and bladder, but the bladder should be that of an ox, and of the largest size; to the extremity of which must be fitted a pewter pipe about a foot long, and about half an inch in diameter, having the extremity which is to enter the gut made completely smooth, that it may not injure the internal coat of the bowel.\n\nPrevious to administering a clyster, it is often necessary to free the great gut from a quantity of hardened excrement which it may contain. This is best performed by means of the hand, and the operation is called raking, or back-raking. The hand is easily introduced, as the diameter of the great gut is in the horse very large. Care must be taken before introducing the hand, to grease it well with oil or hogs lard, and to have the nails cut perfectly close, for fear of injuring the gut. This mode of extracting the hardened excrement is frequently required, and will succeed when medicine would probably only serve to increase the animal's distress.\n\nLarge syringes are frequently employed for the purpose of administering clysters; but such instruments are exceedingly improper, as their tubes are very short, and they are very difficult to manage, especially if the animal should prove restless from pain, as frequently happens in cases of colic; where, as we shall see, clysters are very frequently required.\n\nClysters are peculiarly requisite in those cases where medicine cannot be conveniently given by the mouth; as in locked-jaw, or when there is any obstruction in the throat, or wound of the tongue. In such circumstances horses may frequently be kept alive for many weeks, by the frequent exhibition of nourishing clysters.","sp":79,"ep":79},{"h":"DRENCHES","t":"This form is chiefly suited to those remedies that are easily soluble in water, or which readily mix with that fluid, and which have not any very disagreeable taste. Hence all mucilaginous substances, some resins, and many of the aromatics, may be given in this form. It is proper, in compounding a drench, that the substances composing it be thoroughly mixed with each other. It not unfrequently happens, that oils or balsams are given by way of drench, without any pains having been taken to combine them fully with the watery part of the medicine; and when substances that would admit of being finely powdered, are administered in this way, the carelessness of grooms or farriers is too often such as to give them in a very coarse state. In the former case the oil or balsam swimming in the liquid hangs about the mouth and throat of the animal, and by its unpleasant taste renders him averse to the repetition of the medicine; in the latter case, it is evident that the remedy is not reduced to that state in which it is capable of exerting its full effect.","sp":78,"ep":79},{"h":"DRENCHES ARE USUALLY ADMINISTERED BY","t":"s are usually administered by means of a horn, which is that of an ox or cow, with the larger end cut into the form of a spout. Sometimes when a horn is not at hand, a bottle is employed; but this is very improper, as in the horse's struggling, which often happens in administering a drench, the neck of the bottle may be broken, and occasion much mischief.\n\nIn giving a drench by means of the horn, the animal's tongue is to be held down with the left hand, as in giving a ball; and when his head is sufficiently raised, the drench is to be poured cautiously into his mouth. Every stable should be provided with a drenching horn.\n\nIn preparing drenches, farriers almost always make use of ale or beer, as the menstruum or diluent; but this is often very absurd, and can be proper only in the preparation of cordial drenches. Those of a cooling nature should be mixed, either with common water, or with some mucilaginous infusion.\n\nDrenches are seldom given with dexterity, and thus a considerable quantity of the medicine is frequently spilled. This circumstance renders them often very inconvenient, particularly in cases where there is any swelling or painful affection either of the mouth or throat. Under such circumstances it is scarcely advisable to administer medicine in the form of a drench; as, independently of the resistance given by the horse, which will certainly waste much of the medicine, the forcing of a drench down his throat, when it is in an inflamed or irritable state, may be followed by very unpleasant consequences. Mr Clark says that he has frequently observed a simple solution of nitre in water, sweetened with honey or molasses, when given in cases such as we have described, to occasion violent coughing, trembling and panting, inasmuch that the poor animal was like to drop down, merely from the acute pain he suffered, from a medicine being administered to him in the form of a drench at such a critical period.\n\nEven the position in which the horse's head is placed to receive a drench may, in these cases, excite the most violent pain, from the diffusion which the muscles of the throat undergo, when the head and tongue are held in so awkward a situation.\n\nThe great advantage of a drench is, that remedies exhibited in this form produce their effect much more speedily than when given in the form of a ball, which may take a considerable time to be dissolved in the juices of the stomach. Drenches are therefore particularly suited to urgent cases, in which it is necessary to give immediate relief.","sp":79,"ep":79},{"h":"END OF THE EIGHTH VOLUME","t":"ERRATA IN FLUXIONS.\n\nPage. Col.

This idea of fairies has a near affinity with that of the Greeks and Romans, concerning the nymphs of the woods, mountains, and springs; and an ancient scholiast on Theocritus says, \"The nymphs are demons which appear on the mountains in the figure of women;\" and what is more surprising, the Arabs and other orientals have their ginn and peri, of whom they entertain the like notions.\n\nBut fairies have been likewise described as of either sex, and generally as of minute stature, though capable of assuming various forms and dimensions. The most charming representation imaginable of these children of romantic fancy, is in the Midsummer Night's Dream of Shakespeare; in referring to which, we no doubt have been anticipated by the recollection of almost every reader.\n\nSpenser's Faery Queene is an epic poem, under the persons and characters of fairies. This sort of poetry raises a pleasing kind of horror in the mind of the reader, and amuses his imagination with the strangeness and novelty of the persons who are represented in it; but, as a vehicle of instruction, the judicious object to it, as not having probability enough to make any moral impression.\n\nThe belief of fairies still subsists in many parts of our own country. The\n\n\"Swart fairy of the mine\"\n\n(of German extraction), has scarce yet quitted our subterraneous works; (vid. next article.) Puck, or Robin Good-Fellow, still haunts many of our villages. And in many parts of Scotland, new born children are watched till the christening is over, lest they should be stolen or changed by some of these fantastical existences.\n\nFAIRY of the Mine; an imaginary being, an inhabitant of mines. The Germans believed in two species; one fierce and malevolent: the other a gentle race, appearing like little old men dressed like the miners, and not much above two feet high. These wander about the drifts and chambers of the works; seem perpetually employed,\nFAIRY Circle or Ring, a phenomenon pretty frequent in the fields, &c., supposed by the vulgar to be traced by the fairies in their dances. There are two kinds of it; one of about seven yards in diameter, containing a round bare path, a foot broad, with green grass in the middle of it. The other is of different bigness, encompassed with a circumference of grass. Messrs. Jessop and Walker, in the Philosophical Transactions, ascribe them to lightning; which is thought to be confirmed by their being most frequently produced after storms of that kind, as well as by the colour and brilliancy of the grass roots when first observed. Lightning, like all other fires, moves round, and burns more in the extremity than in the middle: the second circle arises from the first, the grass burnt up growing very plentifully afterwards. Others maintain that these circles are made by ants, which are frequently found in great numbers therein.\u2014Mr. Cavallo, in his treatise on electricity, does not think that lightning is at all concerned in the formation of them: \"They are not (says he) always of a circular figure; and, as I am informed, they seem to be rather beds of mushrooms than the effects of lightning.\"\n\nWe have frequently observed beds of mushrooms arranged in a circular form like what are called fairy rings; but it will be difficult to account for the mushroom feed being disposed in this manner. It is probable that the feed is dispersed over the whole field, and remains dormant till it is acted on by some stimulus to excite its vegetating powers. Perhaps this stimulus is atmospheric electricity, which acting on particular spots only, produces on them an abundant crop of mushrooms, while none appear in other places.","sp":5,"ep":6},{"h":"FAITH","t":"in Philosophy and Theology, that assent which we give to a proposition advanced by another, the truth of which we do not immediately perceive from our own reason or experience; or it is a judgment or assent of the mind, the motive whereof is not any intrinsic evidence, but the authority or testimony of some other who reveals or relates it. Hence, as there are two kinds of authorities and testimonies, the one of God, and the other of man, faith becomes distinguished into divine and human.\n\nDivine Faith, is that founded on the authority of God; or it is that assent we give to what is revealed by God.\n\nThe objects of this faith, therefore, are matters of revelation. See Revelation and Religion.\n\nHuman Faith, is that whereby we believe what is told us by men. The object hereof is matter of human testimony and evidence. See Metaphysics.\n\nFaith, in practical theology, makes the first of the theological virtues or graces.\n\nFaith in God, in this sense, denotes such a conviction of his being, perfections, character, and government, as produces love, trust, worship, obedience, and resignation.\n\nFaith in Christ, as it has been defined by some, is a mere assent to the gospel as true; according to others, it signifies such a persuasion that he is the Messiah, and such a desire and expectation of the blessings which he has promised in his gospel to his sincere disciples, as engage the mind to fix its dependence upon him, and subject itself to him in all the ways of holy obedience. See Theology.\n\nFaith, likewise, in respect to futurity, is a moral principle, implying faith a conviction of the reality and importance of a future state, as is sufficient to regulate the temper and conduct.\n\nFides, or Fidelity (Fides), was deified by the ancient Romans, and had a temple in the Capitol consecrated to her by Attilius Catalinus. Her priests wore white veils: unbloody sacrifices were offered to her, and the greatest oaths were taken in her name. Horace clothes her in white, places her in the retinue of Fortune, and makes her the filter of Justice, Od. 24, 35. l. i. Public Faith is represented in a great number of medals; sometimes with a basket of fruit in one hand, and some ears of corn in the other; and sometimes holding a turtle-dove. But the most usual symbol is two hands joined together. The inscriptions are generally, Fides Augufis, Fides Exercitus, or Fides Militum, &c.","sp":6,"ep":6},{"h":"FAITHORN","t":"WILLIAM, an ingenious English artist, a native of London, was the disciple of Peak the painter, and worked with him three or four years. At the breaking out of the civil war, Peak espoused the cause of his sovereign: and Faithorn, who accompanied his master, was taken prisoner by the rebels at Baringhouse, from whence he was sent to London, and confined in Aldergate. In this uncomfortable situation he exercised his graver; and a small head of the first Villars duke of Buckingham, in the style of Melan, is reckoned among his performances at that time. The solicitations of his friends in his favour at last prevailed; and he was released from prison, with permission to retire to the continent. In France he found protection and encouragement from the Abb\u00e9 de Marolles; and it was at this time that he formed an acquaintance with Nanteuil, from whose instructions he derived very considerable advantages. About the year 1650 he returned to England, and soon after married the filter of a Captain Croun. By her he had two sons; Henry, who was a bookeller, and William an engraver in mezzotinto. Faithorn opened a shop near Temple-Bar, where he sold not only his own engravings, but those of other English artists, and imported a considerable number of prints from Holland, France, and Italy. About the year 1680, he retired from his shop, and resided in Printing-House Yard; but he still continued to work for the bookellers, especially Royton, Martin, and Peak the younger, his former master's brother. He painted portraits from the life in crayons; which art he learned of Nanteuil during his abode in France. He also painted in miniature; and his performances in both these styles were much esteemed. His spirits were broken by the indifferency and dilapidation of his son William; and a lingering consumption put an end to his life in 1691. He wrote a book Upon Drawing, Graving, and Etching, for which he was celebrated by his friend Thomas Flatman the poet.","sp":6,"ep":6},{"h":"FAKIRS","t":"Indian monks or friars. They outdo\nthe fervency and mortification of the ancient Ancho-\nrets or Solitaries. Some of them make a vow of con-\ntinuing all their lifetime in one posture, and keep it\neffectually. Others never lie down; but continue in\na standing posture all their lives, supported only by a\nstick, or rope under their arm pits. Some mangle\ntheir bodies with scourges and knives. They look\nupon themselves to have conquered every passion, and\ntriumphed over the world; and accordingly scruple\nnot, as if in a state of innocence, to appear entirely\nnaked in public.\n\nThe common people of East India are thoroughly\npersuaded of the virtue and innocence of the fakirs;\nnotwithstanding which, they are accused of commit-\nting the most enormous crimes in private.\n\nThey have also another kind of fakirs, who do not\npractice such severities: these flock together in com-\npanies, and go from village to village; prophesying,\nand telling fortunes. They are wicked villains, and it\nis dangerous for a man to meet them in a lone place:\nnevertheless, the Indian idolaters have them in the ut-\nmost veneration. They make use of drums, trumpets,\nand other musical instruments, to rouse their souls, and\nwork themselves up to an artificial ecstacy, the better to\npublish their pretended prophecies.\n\nSome of the votaries of these fakirs most devoutly\nkiss their privy parts; and they receive this monstrous\ndeclaration of respect with a kind of ecstatic pleasure.\nThe most sober and discreet Indians consult them in\nthis preposterous attitude; and their female votaries\nconverse with them a considerable time with the most\nindecent freedom.\n\nThe fire they burn is made of cows dung, dried in\nthe sun. When they are disposed to sleep, they repose\nthemselves on cows dung, and sometimes on ordure\nitself. They are so indulgent towards every living\ncreature, that they suffer themselves to be overrun\nwith vermin, or stung by insects, without the least re-\nluctancy or complaint.\n\nIt is more than probable, those Indian friars have\nsome secret art to kill their senses asleep, in order to\nrender themselves in a great measure insensible of the\nexcessive torments they voluntarily undergo. Oving-\nton affirms us, that \"as he was one day in an assem-\nbly of fakirs, he observed, that they drank opiates in-\nfused in water; the intoxicating virtue thereof was\nenough to turn their brain.\"\n\nThe garment of the chief fakirs consists of three or\nfour yards of orange-colored linen, which they tie\nround them, and a tiger's skin, which hangs over their\nshoulders. Their hair is woven in tresses, and forms a\nkind of turban. The superior of the fakirs is distin-\nguished from the rest by having a greater number of\npieces in his garment, and by a chain of iron, two yards\nlong, tied to his leg. When he deigns to rest in any\nplace, a garment is spread upon the ground; on which\nhe sits and gives audience, whilst his disciples publish\nhis virtues.\n\nSome persons of quality in India have become fa-\nkirs: among others, five great lords belonging to the\ncourt of Shah Gahan, Mogul of the Indies. It is said,\nthere are about two millions of fakirs in the East In-\ndies.","sp":6,"ep":7},{"h":"FALASHA","t":"a people of Abyssinia, of Jewish ori-\ngin, described by Mr Bruce, who was at great pains to\nacquaint himself with their history by cultivating the\nfriendship of the most learned persons among them he\ncould meet with.\n\nAccording to the accounts received from them, the\nFalasha are the descendants of those Jews who came\nfrom Palestine into Ethiopia, as attendants of Menilek\nthe son of the queen of Sheba or Saba by Solomon.\nThey agree in the relations given by the Abyssinians\nof that princess, but deny that the posterity of those\nwho came with Menilek ever embraced the Christian\nreligion, as the Abyssinians say they did. They say,\nthat at the decline of the Jewish commerce, when the\nports of the Red Sea fell into the hands of other na-\ntions, and no intercourse took place between them and\nJerusalem, the Jewish inhabitants quitted the sea coasts\nand retired into the province of Dembea. While they\nremained in the cities on the Red Sea, they exercised\nthe trade of brick and tile making, pottery, thatching\nhouses, &c., and after leaving the sea coasts, they chose\nthe country of Dembea on account of the plenty of\nmaterials afforded for exercising the trades they pro-\nfessed. Here they carried the art of pottery to a\ngreat degree of perfection, multiplied exceedingly,\nand became very numerous and powerful about the\ntime that the Abyssinians were converted to Chris-\ntianity. As this event was accounted by them an apo-\ntasy from the true religion, they now separated them-\nselves from the Abyssinians, and declared one Phineas,\nof the line of Solomon, their king. Thus they say,\nthey have still a prince of the house of Judah for their\nsovereign, though their affection is treated with con-\ntempt, and a nickname bestowed on the Falashan fam-\nily by the other Abyssinians. About the year 960,\nthe queen of this people, after extirpating the Abyssi-\nnian princes on the rock Damo, assumed the sover-\neignty of the whole empire, which they retained for\nsome time; but their power being by degrees reduced,\nthey were obliged to take up their residence among the\nrugged mountains of Samen; one of which they chose\nfor their capital, and which has ever since been called\nthe Jew's Rock. About the year 1600, they were al-\nmost entirely ruined by an overthrow from the Abyssi-\nnians, in which both their king and queen were slain;\nsince which time they have been in subjection to the\nemperors of that country, but are still governed by their\nown princes. When Mr Bruce was in Abyssinia they\nwere supposed to amount to about 100,000 effective\nmen. Gideon and Judith were the names of the king\nand queen at that time; and these, according to our\nauthor, seem to be preferred to others for the royal\nfamily.\n\nThe language of this people is very different from\nthe Hebrew, Samaritan, or any other which the Jews\never spoke in their own country. On being interro-\ngated concerning it by Mr Bruce, they said, that it\nwas probably one of those spoken by the nations on the\nRed Sea, among whom they had settled at their first\ncoming. They arrived in Abyssinia speaking Hebrew,\nand with the advantage of having books in that lan-\nguage; but had now forgot it, which indeed is not to\nbe wondered at, as they had lost their Hebrew books,\nand were entirely ignorant of the art of writing. At\nthe time of their leaving Jerusalem, they were in pos-\nsession both of the Hebrew and Samaritan copies of\nthe law; but when their fleet was destroyed in the\ntime of Rehoboam, and no farther communication with Jerusalem took place, they were obliged to use translations of the Scriptures, or those copies which were in possession of the shepherds, who, they say, were all Jews before the time of Solomon. On being asked, however, where the shepherds got their copy, and being told, that notwithstanding the invasion of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar, there was still a communication with Jerusalem by means of the Ishmaelite Arabs through Arabia, they frankly acknowledged that they could not tell; neither had they any memorials of the history either of their own or any other country; all that they believed in this case being derived from mere tradition, their histories, if any existed, having been destroyed by the famous Moorish captain Gragn\u00e9. They say that the first book of Scripture they received was that of Enoch; and they place that of Job immediately after it, supposing that patriarch to have lived soon after the flood. They have no copy of the Old Testament in the Falasha language, what they make use of being in that of Geez. This is sold to them by the Abyssinian Christians, who are the only scribes in that country. No difference takes place about corruptions of the text; nor do the Falasha know anything of the Jewish Talmud, Targum, or Cabala.

Several authors take the name falcon to have been occasioned by its crooked talons or pounces, which resemble a falx or sickle. Giraldus derives it \u00e0 falcando, because it flies in a curve.\n\nThe falcon, or falcon gentle, is both for the fist and for the lure. In the choice, take one that has wide nostrils, high and large eyelids, a large black eye; a round head, somewhat full on the top; barb feathers on the clap of the beaks, which should be short, thick, and of an azure colour; the breast large, round, and fleshy; and the thighs, legs, and feet, large and strong, with the fear of the foot soft and bluish: the pounces should be black, with wings long and crofling the train, which should be short and very pliable.\n\nThe name falcon is refrained to the female: for the male is much smaller, weaker, and less courageous, than the female; and therefore is denominated taffel, or tirelet. The falcon is excellent at the river, brook, and even field; and flies chiefly at the larger game, as wild bole, kite, crow, heron, crane, pye, shoveler, &c. For further particulars, see Falconry and Hawking.\n\nThe custom of carrying a falcon extended to many countries, and was esteemed a distinction of a man of rank. The Welsh had a saying, That you may know a gentleman by his hawk, horse, and greyhound. In fact, a person of rank seldom went without one on his hand. Harold, afterwards king of England, is painted going on a most important embassy, with a hawk on his hand and a dog under his arm. Henry VI. is represented at his nuptials, attended by a nobleman and his falcon.

Historians take notice of this post as early as the year 1250.\n\nA falconer should be well acquainted with the quality and mettle of his hawks, that he may know which of them to fly early and which late.

Neither must he forget to take with him any of his hawking implements; and it is necessary he should be skilful in making lures, hoods of all sorts, jesses, bewets, and other furniture.

In the days of Ctesias, the Indians hunted hares and foxes by means of rapacious birds; and Aristotle says expressly, \"In Thrace, the men go out to catch birds with hawks. They beat the reeds and bushes which grow in marshy places, in order to raise the small birds, which the hawks pursue and drive to the ground, where the fowlers kill them with poles.\"\n\nReflecting Thrace, which is situated above Amphipolis, a wonderful circumstance is related, which to many may appear almost incredible. We are informed that boys went into the fields, and pursued birds by the assistance of hawks. When they found a convenient place for their purpose, they called their hawks by their particular names, which came immediately on hearing their voices, and pursued the birds into the bushes, where the boys killed them with sticks, and thus made them their prey. When the hawks themselves laid hold of any birds, they threw them to the fowlers, and received, for their fidelity, a share of the game. If we add the spaniel, now employed to find out the game, the hood placed upon the head of the hawk, and the thong for holding it, we may clearly perceive in these ancient accounts the practice of modern times. Falconers still give a portion of the game to the hawk, as was the usual practice of the boys at Thrace.\n\nAccording to the testimony of Philo, Pliny, Aelian, and others, the birds were sometimes driven into nets by the hawks employed in these sports. From India and Thrace, therefore, it seems manifest, that the Greeks obtained their first information as to the method of fowling with birds of prey; but they themselves do not appear to have adopted the practice at a very early period. In Italy, however, it must have been extremely well understood, since it is mentioned by Martial and Apuleius as a thing everywhere known. After being once known, it was never totally forgotten; but it shared the fate of other inventions in this respect, that it was originally admired, and afterwards much neglected, by which means it received no material improvements for a considerable time; yet it was at length brought to the utmost perfection. We find mention made of this sport in the Roman laws, and in many authors of the fourth and subsequent century. In the time of Constantine the Great, Julius Firmicus Maternus assures us, according to the superstitious notions of that period, that such as are born under certain signs, will become great sportmen, and keep hounds and falcons. Sidonius, who flourished about the end of the fifth century, praises Heridicius, the brother of his wife, because he was the first in his territories who practised hunting and fowling with dogs and hawks.\n\nFalconry appears to have been carried to the greatest perfection, and to have been much esteemed at the chief courts of Europe, so early as the 12th century, for which reason some have ascribed the invention to the emperor Frederic I., whereas he appears to have been only the first who introduced the practice into Italy, according to the testimony of Rodericus and Collenuccio; and Frederic II. wrote a book entitled, De arte venandi cum avibus, to which the practice has been much indebted. Falconry has had a number of admirers among the fair sex, perhaps in a superior degree to any other sport or amusement whatever of a similar nature; but their attachment was destroyed by the invention of gunpowder, which was accompanied both with alarm and danger. We conclude our remarks on the history of falconry with an observation of Demetrius, who flourished in the 13th century, and who expressly wrote at large upon this subject. He desires sportmen to say their prayers (\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03be\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5) before they go out to the field, which appears wholly incompatible with the practice of modern times, and seems as impious as to crave assistance of God when preparing for a piratical expedition.","sp":8,"ep":9},{"h":"FALCONRY","t":"the art of training all manner of hawks, but more especially the larger ones called falcons, to the exercise of hawking. See Hawking.\n\nWhen a falcon is taken, the must be fed in such a manner, that, as the feeling slackens, she may see what provision lies before her; but care ought to be taken, not to feed her too hard. A falcon or hawk newly taken should have all new furniture, as new jesses of good leather, mailed leashes with buttons at the end, and new bewets. There should also be provided a small round stick, to stroke the hawk; because, the oftener this is done, the sooner and better will she be mannered. She must also have two good bells, that she may be found when she scattereth. Her hood should be well fashioned, raised, and embossed against her eyes, deep, and yet tight enough beneath, that it may fall about her head without hurting her; and her beak and talons must be a little coped, but not so near as to make them bleed.\n\nIf it be a foar-falcon, which had already passed the seas, she will indeed be harder to reclaim, but will prove the best of falcons. Her food must be good and warm, and given her twice or thrice a day, till she be full gorged: the best for this purpose is pigeons, larks, or other live birds; because she must be broken off by degrees from her accustomed feeding. When she is fed, you must hoop and lure, as you do when you call a hawk, that she may know when you intend to give her meat. On this occasion the must be unhooded gently; and after giving her two or three bits, her hood must be put on again, when she is to get two or three bits more. Care must be taken that she be close fed; and after three or four days, her diet may be lessened: the falconer setting her every night to perch by him, that he may awaken her often in the night. In this manner he must proceed, till he find her to grow tame and gentle; and when she begins to feed eagerly, he may give her a sheep's heart. He may now begin to unhood her in the daytime; but it must be far from company, first giving her a bit or two, then hooding her gently, and giving her as much more. When she is sharp fed, he may now unhood her, and give her some meat just against his face and eyes, which will make her less afraid of the countenance of others. She must be borne continually on the silt, till she is properly mannered, causing her to feed in company, giving her in the morning, about sunrise, the wing of a pullet; and in the evening, the foot of a hare or coney, cut off above the joint, flayed and laid in water, which being squeezed, is to be given her with the pinion of a hen's wing.

A great deal of money is also got here by the carriage of goods landed at Carron wharf to Glasgow. This town is remarkable for a battle fought in its neighbourhood between Edward I. of England, and the Scots commanded by the steward of Scotland, Cummin of Bardenoch, and Sir William Wallace. The latter had been invested with the supreme command; but perceiving that this gave umbrage to the nobility, he resigned his power into the hands of the noblemen above mentioned, referring to himself only the command of a small body who refused to follow another leader. The Scots generals placed their pikemen along the front, and lined the intervals between the three bodies of which their army was composed, with archers; and dreading the great superiority of the English cavalry, endeavoured to secure their front by palliadoes tied together with ropes. The battle was fought on the 22nd of July 1298. The king of England divided his army likewise into three bodies; and by the superiority of his archers, defeated the Scots with great slaughter. Wallace alone preferred entire the troops he commanded; and retiring behind the Carron, marched leisurely along the banks of that river, which protected him from the enemy. In this battle fell John de Graham, a gentleman much celebrated for his valour, and styled the right hand of the gallant Wallace. His epitaph is still to be seen on a plain stone in the churchyard of Falkirk.

See Adam, and Antediluvians, and Original Sin. The account which Moses gives of this transaction is extremely brief and concise. The serpent, he informs us, being more subtle than any beast of the field, asked the woman, whether it was true that God had not granted her and her husband leave to eat of every tree in the garden? She answered, That God had allowed them to eat of all, except only the fruit of the tree in the midst of the garden; which he commanded they should not taste, nor so much as touch, lest they should die. The serpent replied, That they should not die; for God knew the virtue of the tree; and that, so soon as they ate of it, their eyes would be opened, and they would become like gods, knowing good and evil. Eve, seeing the fruit tempting to the view, took of the fruit and ate; and gave also to her husband of it, and he did eat. Immediately the eyes of both were opened; when perceiving they were naked, they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons. Adam and Eve, hearing the voice of God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, hid themselves among the trees; but, on God's calling for Adam, he excused himself for not appearing, because he was naked. God demanded of him, who it was that told him he was naked; and whether he had disobeyed his command, in eating the forbidden fruit? Adam confessed that the woman had offered him the fruit, and he had tasted it. She, being examined likewise, acknowledged what she had done; but said, the serpent had seduced and deceived her. God then proceeded to judgment; he first cursed the serpent above all beasts, and condemned him to go on his belly, and eat the dust; adding, that he would put enmity between him and the woman, and their offspring; that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head, who should bruise the other's heel. The woman was subjected to the pains of childbirth, as well as to the dominion of her husband; and as to the man, God cursed the ground for his sake, declaring, that it should bring forth thorns and thistles, and he should earn his bread by the sweat of his brow, till he returned to the dust, from whence he was taken. At last, having clothed them both with skins, he turned them out of the garden, lest they should take of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever; then, to prevent any attempt to return to their former habitation, he placed cherubims at the east of the garden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the passage to the tree of life.\n\nThis concise account being, at first view, encumbered with some difficulties, several learned and pious men have been inclined to believe the whole ought to be taken in an allegorical sense, and not according to the strictness of the letter: they allege, that the ancients, and particularly the eastern nations, had two different ways of delivering their divinity and philosophy, one popular, and the other mysterious; that the Scripture uses both occasionally; sometimes accommodating itself to the capacities of the people, and at other times to the real but more veiled truth; and that, to obviate the many difficulties which occur in the literal history of this sad catastrophe, the safest way is to understand it as a parabolical story, under which the real circumstances are disguised and concealed, as a mystery not fit to be more explicitly declared.\n\nThough it cannot be denied that some of the ancient philosophers affected such an allegorical way of writing, to conceal their notions from the vulgar, and keep their learning within the bounds of their own school; yet it is apparent Moses had no such design; and as he pretends only to relate matters of fact, just as they happened, without art or disguise, it cannot be supposed that this history of the fall is to be taken in a literal sense, as well as the rest of his writings. It is generally agreed, that the serpent which tempted Eve was the devil, who envying the privileges of man in innocence, tempted him, and was the cause of his forfeiting all those advantages which he had received from God at his creation; and that to this end he assumed the form of a serpent. These interpretations are supported by many passages of Scripture, where the devil is called the serpent, and the old serpent. (See John viii. 44. 2 Cor. xi. 3. and Rev. xii. 9.) Some believe that the serpent had then the use of speech, and conversed familiarly with the woman, without her conceiving any distrust of him; and that God, to punish the malice with which he had abused Eve, deprived him of the use of speech. Others maintain, that a real serpent having eaten of the forbidden fruit, Eve from thence concluded, that she too might eat of it without danger; that in effect she did eat of it, and incurred the displeasure of God by her disobedience. This, say these last authors, is the plain matter of fact which Moses would relate under the allegorical representation of the serpent conversing with Eve.\n\nThe opinion of such as believe this was not a real serpent, but only the devil under that name, is no less liable\nliable to exception than any of the rest. For though the devil is frequently styled in Scripture the serpent, and the old serpent, yet why he should be called the most subtle beast of the field, we cannot conceive; neither will the punishment inflicted on the serpent suffer us to doubt, but that a serpent's body at least was employed in the transaction.\n\nThe nature of the forbidden fruit is another circumstance in this relation that has occasioned no less variety of conjectures. The Rabbins believe it was the vine; others that it was wheat; and others, from the circumstance of Adam and Eve's covering themselves with fig leaves immediately after their transgression, tell us, that this fruit must have been the fig; some think it was the cherry; and the generality of the Latins will have it to be the apple.\n\nThose who admire allegorical interpretations, will have the forbidden fruit to have been no other than the sensual act of generation, for which the punishment inflicted on the woman was the pain of childbirth. But this opinion has not the least foundation in the words of Moses, especially if we consider that Adam knew not his wife till after their expulsion out of Paradise.\n\nMany have been the suppositions and conjectures upon this subject in general; and some have so far indulged their fancy in the circumstances of the fall, that they have perverted the whole narration of Moses into a fable full of the most shameful extravagancies.","sp":10,"ep":12},{"h":"FALLACY","t":"a deception, fraud, or false appearance.\n\nThe Epicureans deny that there is any such thing as a fallacy of the senses: for, according to them, all our sensations and perceptions, both of sense and phantasy, are true; whence they make sense the primary criterion of truth.\n\nThe Cartesians, on the other hand, maintain, that we should suspect as false, or at most as dubious, everything that presents itself to us by means only of the external senses, because they frequently deceive us.

When such an accusation is brought before them, they are obliged candidly to examine the affair. But, besides this, the presbytery considers itself obliged to proceed against any of its members, if a fama clamosa of the scandal is so great that they cannot be vindicated unless they begin the process. This they can do without any particular accuser, after they have inquired into the rise, occasion, and authors, of this report. It is a maxim in the kirk of Scotland, that religion must suffer if the scandalous or immoral actions of a minister are not corrected. And wherever a minister is reputed guilty of any immorality (although before the most popular preacher in the kingdom), none almost will attend upon his ministry. Therefore the presbytery, for the sake of religion, is obliged to proceed against a minister in case of a fama clamosa. This, however, is generally done with great tenderness. After they have considered the report raised against him, then they order him to be cited, draw out a full copy of what is reported, with a list of the witnesses' names to be led for proving this allegation. He is now to be formally summoned to appear before them; and he has warning given him, at least 10 days before the time of his appearance, to give in his answers to what is termed the libel; and the names of the witnesses ought also to be sent him. If at the time appointed the minister appear, the libel is to be read to him, and his answers are also to be read. If the libel be found relevant, then the presbytery is to endeavour to bring him to a confession. If the matter confessed be of a scandalous nature, such as uncleanness, the presbytery generally depose him from his office, and appoint him in due time to appear before the congregation where the scandal was given, and to make public confession of his crime and repentance.

In Italy and Spain they have a large sort of square fans, suspended in the middle of their apartments, and particularly over the tables: these, by a motion at first given them, and which they retain a long time on account of their perpendicular suspension, help to cool the air and drive off flies.\n\nIn the Greek church, a fan is put into the hands of the deacons in the ceremony of their ordination, in allusion to a part of the deacon's office in that church, which is to keep the flies off the priests during the celebration of the sacrament.\n\nWhat is called a fan amongst us and throughout the chief parts of Europe, is a thin skin, or piece of paper, taffety, or other light stuff, cut semicircularly, and mounted on several little sticks of wood, ivory, tortoiseshell, or the like. If the paper be single, the sticks of the mounting are pasted on the least ornamented side; if double, the sticks are placed between them.\n\nBefore they proceed to place the sticks, which they call mounting the fan, the paper is to be plaited in such a manner, as that the plates may be alternately inward and outward.\n\nIt is in the middle of each plait, which is usually about half an inch broad, that the sticks are to be pasted; and these again are to be all joined and riveted together at the other end; they are very thin, and scarcely exceed one-third of an inch in breadth; and where they are pasted to the paper, are still narrower, continuing thus to the extremity of the paper. The two outer ones are bigger and stronger than the others. The number of sticks rarely exceeds 22. The sticks are usually provided by the cabinetmakers or toymen; the fan-painters plait the papers, paint, and mount them.\n\nThe common painting is either in colours or gold leaf, applied on a silvered ground, both prepared by the goldbeaters. Sometimes they paint on a gold ground, but it is rarely; true gold being too dear, and false too paltry. To apply the silver leaves on the paper, they use a composition, which they pretend is a great secret, but which appears to be no other than gum arabic, sugar-candy, and a little honey, melted in common water, and mixed with a little brandy. This composition is laid on with a sponge; then laying the silver leaves thereon, and pressing them gently down with a linen ball stuffed with cotton, they catch hold, and adhere together. When, instead of silver, gold ground is laid, the same method is observed. The ground being well dried, a number of the papers are well beaten together on a block, and by this means the silver or gold get a lustre as if they had been burnished.\n\nFan is also an instrument to winnow corn. The machine used for this purpose by the ancients seems to have been of a form similar to ours. The fan, which Virgil calls *mylica vanus lacchi*, was used at initiations into the mysteries of the ancients: for as the persons who were initiated into any of the mysteries, were to be particularly good, this instrument, which separates the wheat from the chaff, was the fittest emblem that could be of setting apart the good and virtuous from the vicious and useless part of mankind. It is figuratively applied in a similar manner in Luke iii. 17.","sp":14,"ep":14},{"h":"FANATICS","t":"wild, enthusiastic, visionary persons, who pretend to revelation and inspiration.\n\nThe ancients called those *fanatici* who passed their time in temples (*fans*), and being often seized with a kind of enthusiasm, as if inspired by the divinity, showed wild and antic gestures.

Shaking the head was also common among the fanatici; for Lampridius informs us, that the emperor Heliogabalus was arrived at that pitch of madness, as to shake his head with the gashed fanatics.

During his vacant hours he wrote divers poems, and made several translations. At the Restoration it was expected he would have been made one of the secretaries of state; however, he was made master of the requisits; a station in those times of considerable profit. Afterwards, on account of his skill in the Latin language, he was made secretary for that tongue. In 1661, he was sent envoy to the king of Portugal. In 1662, he was again sent to that court with the title of ambassador, and negotiated the marriage of his master King Charles II. with the infanta Donna Catherine. Upon his return he was made one of the privy council. In 1664, he was sent ambassador to both the courts of Spain and Portugal; at which time the foundation of peace between those crowns and England was laid by him. His conduct during his former employments in those courts gained him such high esteem there, that his reception was magnificent, exceeding all that were before, which those kings declared was not to be a precedent to succeeding ambassadors. He died at Madrid in 1666, on the very day he had fixed for setting out on his return to England. Besides some original poems, and other translations, he published a translation of Battista Guarini's Pastor Fido, and another of the Lusiad of Camoens.

The difference between the two on our stage is, that comedy keeps to nature and probability, and therefore is confined to certain laws prescribed by ancient critics; whereas farce disallows of all laws, or rather sets them aside on occasion.

See Lease.\n\nThis in divers parts is differently termed: in the north, it is a tack; in Lancashire, fermeholt; in Essex, a wike, &c.\n\nIn the corrupted Latin, firma signified a place inclosed or shut in: whence, in some provinces, Menage observes,\nFarm. obserues, they call cloforye, or cloforye, what in others they call a farm. Add, that we find locare ad firmam, to signify to let to farm; probably on account of the sure hold the tenant here has in comparison of tenants at will.\n\nSpelman and Skinner, however, choose to derive the word farm from the Saxon ferme, or feorme, that is, victus, \"provision;\" by reason the country people and tenants anciently paid their rents in victuals and other necessaries, which were afterwards converted into the payment of a sum of money. Whence a farm was originally a place that furnished its landlord with provisions. And among the Normans they still distinguished between farms that pay in kind, i.e., provisions, and those which pay in money; calling the former simply fermetes, and the latter blanche ferme, \"white farm.\"\n\nSpelman shows, that the word firma, anciently signified not only what we now call a farm, but also a feast or entertainment, which the farmer gave the proprietor or landlord, for a certain number of days, and at a certain rate, for the lands he held of him. Thus feorme in the laws of King Canute is rendered by Mr Lambard, victus: and thus we read of reddere firmam unius noctis, and reddebat unum diem de firma; which denote provision for a night and day, the rents about the time of the conquest being all paid in provisions; which custom is said to have been first altered under King Henry I. We also lay to farm duties, imposts, &c.\n\nCulture of a Farm. See Agriculture.\n\nFarm, as connected with gardening, and susceptible of embellishment. See Gardening.\n\nIn speculation, it might have been expected that the first essays of improvement should have been on a farm, to make it both advantageous and delightful; but the fact was otherwise: a small plot was appropriated to pleasure; the rest was reserved for profit only. And this may, perhaps, have been a principal cause of the vicious taste which long prevailed in gardens. It was imagined that a spot set apart from the rest should not be like them: the conceit introduced deviations from nature, which were afterwards carried to such an extent, that hardly any objects truly rural were left within the enclosure, and the view of those without was generally excluded. The first step, therefore, towards a reformation, was by opening the garden to the country, and that immediately led to assimilating them; but still the idea of a spot appropriated to pleasure only prevailed, and one of the latest improvements has been to blend the useful with the agreeable; even the ornamental farm was prior in time to the more rural; and we have at last returned to simplicity by force of refinement.\n\n1. The ideas of pastoral poetry seem now to be the standard of that simplicity; and a place conformable to them is deemed a farm in its utmost purity. An allusion to them evidently enters into the design of the Leafoves (A), where they appear so lovely as to endear the memory of their author; and justify the reputation of Mr Shenstone, who inhabited, made, and celebrated the place: it is a perfect picture of his mind, simple, elegant, and amiable; and will always suggest a doubt, whether the spot inspired his verse, or whether, in the scenes which he formed, he only realized the pastoral images which abound in his songs. The whole is in the same taste, yet full of variety; and, except in two or three trifles, every part is rural and natural. It is literally a grazing farm lying round the house; and a walk, as unaffected and as unadorned as a common field-path, is conducted through the several enclosures. But for a detail of the plan and scenery, as illustrative of the present subject, the reader is referred to the particular description of the Leafoves published by the late Mr Dodtley. We shall only take notice of one or two circumstances independent on the general delineation.\n\nThe art with which the divisions between the fields are diversified is one of them. Even the hedges are distinguished from each other: a common quickset fence is in one place the separation: in another, it is a lofty hedge-row, thick from the top to the bottom; in a third, it is a continued range of trees, with all their stems clear, and the light appearing in the intervals between their boughs, and the bushes beneath them; in others, these lines of trees are broken, a few groups only being left at different distances; and sometimes a wood, a grove, a coppice, or a thicket, is the apparent boundary, and by them both the shape and the style of the enclosures are varied.\n\nThe inscriptions, which abound in the place, are another striking peculiarity: they are well known and justly admired; and the elegance of the poetry, and the aptness of the quotations, atone for their length and their number. But, in general, inscriptions please no more than once: the utmost they can pretend to, except when their allusions are emblematical, is to point out the beauties, or describe the effects, of the spots they belong to; but those beauties and those effects must be very faint, which stand in need of the assistance. Inscriptions, however, to commemorate a departed friend, are evidently exempt from the censure; the monuments would be unintelligible without them; and an urn, in a lonely grove, or in the midst of a field, is a favourite embellishment at the Leafoves: they are indeed among the principal ornaments of the place; for the buildings are mostly mere seats, or little root-houses; a ruin of a priory is the largest, and that has no peculiar beauty to recommend it; but a multiplicity of objects are unnecessary in the farm; the country it commands is full of them; and every natural advantage of the place within itself has been discovered, applied, contrated, and carried to the utmost perfection, in the purest taste, and with inexhaustible fancy.\n\nAmong the ideas of pastoral poetry which are here introduced, its mythology is not omitted; but the allusions are both to ancient and to modern fables; sometimes to the fairies; and sometimes to the naiads and muses. The objects also are borrowed partly from the scenes which this country exhibited some centuries ago, and partly from those of Arcadia: the priory,\n\n(A) In Shropshire, between Birmingham and Stourbridge.\npriory, and a Gothic seat, still more particularly characterized by an inscription in obsolete language and the black letter, belong to the one; the urns, Virgil's obelisk, and a rustic temple of Pan, to the other. All these allusions and objects are indeed equally rural: but the images in an English and classical eclogue are not the same; each species is a distinct imitative character. Either is proper; either will raise the farm it is applied to above the ordinary level; and within the compass of the same place both may be introduced; but they should be separate: when they are mixed, they counteract one another; and no representation is produced of the times and the countries they refer to. A certain district should therefore be allotted to each, that all the fields which belong to the respective characters may lie together, and the corresponding ideas be preserved for a continuance.\n\n2. In such an affortment, the more open and polished scenes will generally be given to the Arcadian shepherd; and those in a lower degree of cultivation, will be thought more conformable to the manners of the ancient British yeomanry. We do not conceive that the country in their time was entirely cleared, or distinctly divided; the fields were surrounded by woods, not by hedges; and if a considerable tract of improved land lay together, it still was not separated into a number of inclosures. The subjects, therefore, proper to receive this character, are those in which cultivation seems to have encroached on the wild, not to have subdued it; as the bottom of a valley in corn, while the sides are still overgrown with wood; and the outline of that wood indented by the tillage creeping more or less up the hill. But a glade of grass, thus circumfanced, does not peculiarly belong to the species; that may occur in a park or pastoral farm; in this, the pastures should rather border on a waste or a common; if large, they may be broken by straggling bushes, thickets, or coppices; and the scattered trees should be beset with brambles and briars. All these are circumstances which improve the beauty of the place; yet appear to be only remains of the wild, not intended for embellishment. Such interruptions must, however, be less frequent in the arable parts of the farm; but there the opening may be divided into several lands, distinguishing, as in common fields, only by different sorts of grain. These will sufficiently break the sameness of the space; and the tillage does not furnish a more pleasing scene, than such a space so broken, if the extent be moderate, and the boundary beautiful.\n\nAs much wood is essential to the character, a spot may easily be found, where turrets rising above the covert, or some arches seen within it, may have the resemblance of a castle or an abbey. The partial concealment is almost necessary to both; for to accord with the age, the buildings must seem to be entire; the ruins of them belong to later days: the dilapidate is, however, advantageous to them as objects; none can be imagined more picturesque, than a tower boomed in trees, or a clutter appearing between the stems and the branches. But the superstitions of the times furnish other objects which are more within compass: hermitages were then real; solitary chapels were common; many of the springs of the country being deemed holy wells, were distinguished by little Gothic domes built over them; and every hamlet had its cross, even this, when perfect, set on a little rustic pillar, and that raised upon a base of circular steps, may in some scenes be considerable: if a situation can be found for a Maypole, whence it would not obtrude itself on every view, that also might not be improper; and an ancient church, however unwelcome it may be when it breaks into the design of a park or a garden, in such a farm as this would be a fortunate accident: nor would the old yew in the church-yard be indifferent; it would be a memorial of the times when it was useful.\n\nMany other objects, significant of the manners of our ancestors, might perhaps, upon recollection, occur; but these are amply sufficient for a place of considerable extent; and cottages must abound in every age and every country; they may therefore be introduced in different forms and positions. Large pieces of water are also particularly proper; and all the varieties of rills are consistent with every species of farm. From the concurrence of so many agreeable circumstances in this, be the force or the effect of the character what it may, a number of pleasing scenes may be exhibited either in a walk or riding, to be contrasted to those which in another part of the place may be formed on Arcadian ideas; or even to be substituted in their stead, if they are omitted.\n\n3. A part may also be free from either of these imitative characters, and laid out in a common simple farm. Some of the greatest beauties of nature are to be found in the fields, and attend an ordinary state of cultivation: wood and water may there be exhibited in several forms and dispositions; we may enlarge or divide the inclosures; and give them such shapes and boundaries as we please; every one may be an agreeable spot; together, they may compose beautiful views; the arable, the pasture, and the mead, may succeed one another; and now and then a little wild may be intermixed without impropriety; every beauty, in short, which is not unfulfilling in an inclosed country, whether it arises from neglect or improvement, is here in its place.\n\nThe buildings, also, which are frequent in such a country, are often beautiful objects; the church and the manor are considerable: the farm-yard itself, if an advantageous situation be chosen for it; if the ricks, and the barns, and the out-houses, are ranged with any design to form them into groups, and if they are properly blended with trees; may be made a picturesque composition. Many of them may be detached from the group, and dispersed about the grounds: the dove-cote, or the dairy, may be separated from the rest; they may be elegant in their forms, and placed wherever they will have the best effect. A common barn, accompanied by a clump, is sometimes pleasing at a distance; a Dutch barn is so when near; and a hay-stack is generally an agreeable circumstance in any position. Each of these may be single; and besides these, all kinds of cottages are proper. Among so many buildings, some may be converted to other purposes than their construction denotes; and, whatever be their exterior, may within be made agreeable retreats, for refreshment, indulgence, or shelter.\n\nWith such opportunities of improvements, even to decoration within itself, and with advantages of prospect into the country about it, a simple farm may undoubtedly be delightful. It will be particularly acceptable.\nFARM\n\nreptable to the owner, if it be close to his park or his garden: the objects which constantly remind him of his rank, impose a kind of constraint; and he feels himself relieved, by retiring sometimes from the splendor of a seat into the simplicity of a farm: it is more than a variety of scene: it is a temporary change of situation in life, which has all the charms of novelty, ease, and tranquility, to recommend it. A place, therefore, can hardly be deemed perfect, which is not provided with such a retreat. But if it be the whole of the place, it seems inadequate to the mansion: a visitor is disappointed; the master is dissatisfied; he is not sufficiently distinguished from his tenants; he misses the appendages incidental to his seat and his fortune; and is hurt at the similarity of his grounds with the country about them. A pastoral or an ancient farm is a little above the common level; but even these, if brought close up to the door, set the house in a field, where it always appears to be neglected and naked.\n\nSome degree of polish and ornament is expected in its immediate environs; and a garden, though it be but a small one, should be interposed between the mansion and any species of farm.\n\nOf an ornamented form.\n\n4. A sense of the propriety of such improvements about a seat, joined to a taste for the more simple delights of the country, probably suggested the idea of an ornamental farm, as the means of bringing every rural circumstance within the verge of a garden. This idea has been partially executed very often; but nowhere, perhaps, so completely, and to such an extent, as at Woburn farm, (near Weybridge in Surrey.) The place contains 150 acres; of which near 35 are adorned to the highest degree; of the rest, about two thirds are in pasture, and the remainder is in tillage. The decorations are, however, communicated to every part: for they are disposed along the sides of a walk, which, with its appendages, forms a broad belt round the grazing-grounds; and is continued, though on a more contracted scale, through the arable. This walk is properly garden; all within it is farm; the whole lies on the two sides of a hill, and on a flat at the foot of it: the flat is divided into corn-fields; the pastures occupy the hill; they are surrounded by the walk, and crossed by a communication carried along the brow, which is also richly dressed, and which divides them into two lawns, each completely encompassed with garden.\n\nThese are in themselves delightful; the ground in both lies beautifully: they are diversified with clumps and single trees; and the buildings in the walk seem to belong to them. On the top of the hill is a large octagon structure; and, not far from it, the ruin of a chapel. To one of the lawns the ruin appears, on the brow of a gentle ascent, backed and grouped with wood; from the other is seen the octagon, upon the edge of a steep fall, and by the side of a pretty grove, which hangs down the declivity. This lawn is further embellished by a neat Gothic building; the former by the house, and the lodge at the entrance; and in both, other objects of less consequence, little seats, alcoves, and bridges, continually occur.\n\nThe buildings are not, however, the only ornaments of the walk; it is shut out from the country, for a considerable length of the way, by a thick and lofty hedge-row, which is enriched with woodbine, jessamine, and every odoriferous plant whose tendrils will entwine with the thicket. A path, generally of sand or gravel, is conducted in a waving line, sometimes close under the hedge, sometimes at a little distance from it; and the turf on either hand is diversified with little groups of shrubs, of firs, or the smallest trees, and often with beds of flowers: these are rather too profusely treed, and hurt the eye by their littleness; but then they replenish the air with their perfumes, and every gale is full of fragrance. In some parts, however, the decoration is more chaste; and the walk is carried between larger clumps of evergreens, thickets of deciduous shrubs, or still more considerably open plantations. In one place it is entirely simple, without any appendages, any gravel, or any fence to separate it from the lawn; and is distinguished only by the richness of its verdure, and the nicety of its preservation. In the arable part it is also of greenward, following the direction of the hedges about the several inclosures: these hedges are sometimes thickened with flowering shrubs; and in every corner or vacant space, is a rosy, a clove or an open clump, or a bed of flowers: but if the parterre has been rilled for the embellishment of the fields, the country has on the other hand been searched for plants new in a garden; and the shrubs and the flowers which used to be deemed peculiar to the one, have been liberally transferred to the other; while their number seems multiplied by their arrangement in so many and such different dispositions. A more moderate use of them would, however, have been better; and the variety more pleasing, had it been less licentious.\n\nBut the excess is only in the borders of the walk; the scenes through which it leads are truly elegant, everywhere rich, and always agreeable. A peculiar cheerfulness overflows both the lawns, arising from the number and the splendor of the objects with which they abound, the lightness of the buildings, the inequalities of the ground, and the varieties of the plantations. The clumps and the groves, though separately small, are often massed by the perspective, and gathered into considerable groups, which are beautiful in their forms, their tints, and their positions. The brow of the hill commands two lovely prospects: the one gay and extensive, over a fertile plain, watered by the Thames, and broken by St Anne's Hill and Windsor Castle; a large mead, of the most luxuriant verdure, lies just below the eye, spreading to the banks of the river; and beyond it the country is full of farms, villages, and villages, and every mark of opulence and cultivation. The other view is more wooded: the steeple of a church, or the turrets of a seat, sometimes rise above the trees; and the bold arch of Walton bridge is there a conspicuous object, equally singular and noble. The inclosures on the flat are more retired and quiet; each is confined within itself; and all together they form an agreeable contrast to the open exposure above them.\n\nWith the beauties which enliven a garden are everywhere intermixed many properties of a farm: both the lawns are pastured; and the lowings of the herds, the bleating of the sheep, and the tinklings of the bell-wringer, resound through all the plantations: even the clucking of poultry is not omitted; for a menagerie of a very simple design is placed near the Gothic building;\nFarmer, a small serpentine river is provided for the water-fowl; while the others stray among the flowering shrubs on the banks, or flit about the neighbouring lawn: and the corn fields are the subjects of every rural employment which arable land from seed-time to harvest can furnish. But though so many of the circumstances occur, the simplicity of a farm is wanting; that idea is lost in such a profusion of ornament; a rusticity of character cannot be preserved amidst all the elegant decorations which may be lavished on a garden.","sp":15,"ep":19},{"h":"FARMER","t":"he that tenants a farm, or is lessee thereof.

Dr Charles Owen was for some time his tutor, and prior to that period he was educated at a school in Llanegryn. His parents from the first having designed him for the ministry, he was sent to prosecute his studies under the justly celebrated Dr Doddridge at Northampton, in 1730. Here, by the rectitude of his conduct and wonderful proficiency, he gained the esteem of that great man, who always spoke of him in the most respectful terms. Having completed his academi- cal studies, Mr Farmer became the chaplain of William Coward, Esq., of Walthamstow, in the county of Essex, and was at the same time chosen minister to a dissenting congregation in that village. Notwithstanding the gratitude with which Mr Coward ought to be remembered by many for his charitable institutions, he had certain peculiarities of temper which rendered him a very disagreeable domestic. His doors were shut at an uncommonly early hour of the night, and neither visitor nor constant resident could afterwards obtain admission. Mr Farmer having one evening been detained, a little beyond that hour, found the doors shut against him, and was under the necessity of applying to a William Snell, Esq., solicitor, a man of eminence, and possessed of many excellent qualifications, in whose family he remained for 30 years, living in the greatest friendship and intimacy. In this gentleman's house he gradually prepared those valuable treatises and dissertations which were afterwards given to the public, and acquired him so much celebrity as a man of letters. He also continued to discharge the duties of his ministerial function to the people of Walthamstow.\n\nWhen a day of thanksgiving was appointed for the fortunate suppression of the rebellion in 1745, Mr Farmer preached a sermon on that occasion which was published the following year. His next work was of considerably greater importance, and was entitled, \"An Inquiry into the Nature and Design of our Lord's temptation in the wilderness.\" 8vo. In this work it was the design of Mr Farmer to prove that the whole was transferred in vision, the different stages of which were intended to point out to him the difficulties and duties of his subsequent ministry. The originality of thought and profound erudition which this work displayed, soon gave it a very extensive circulation, and called forth the exertions of those who were of an opposite opinion. It received one reply under the title of \"Christ's temptations real facts,\" which possessed considerable merit, but much inferior to Mr Farmer's for energy of expression, depth of thinking, and force of argument. But the most masterly, perhaps, of all Mr Farmer's literary productions, was his \"Dissertation on Miracles,\" designed to shew that they are arguments of a divine interposition, and absolute proofs of the mission and doctrine of a prophet. Some have believed, and perhaps not without reason, that this work has no proper rival, notwithstanding the many able treatises upon that subject which have made their appearance in different ages. It was first published in the year 1771. But as great talents are frequently envied, and as this infernal principle is the prolific source of calumny and detraction, so this supereminence work of Mr Farmer was declared to have been chiefly borrowed from Mr le Moine on the same subject\u2014a slander which Mr Farmer refuted in a very able and satisfactory manner. In the year 1775, he published his celebrated \"Essay on the Demoniacs of the New Testament,\" which may be considered as a matterly completion of the design he had in view by his dissertation on miracles. The hypothesis he adopted had been formerly defended with great ability by Mede, Sykes, Lardner, and others; but it was referred for the critical acumen of Mr Farmer to free it completely from those difficulties which still hung around it. His essay on demoniacs was successfully attacked by Dr Worthington and Mr Fell, both of them men of considerable erudition, but much inferior to their able antagonist.\n\nMr Farmer having continued for several years the sole pastor of the congregation at Walthamstow, an able colleague was appointed him in 1761, in consequence of which he became the afternoon preacher to the congregation of Salter's-hall, in the city of London, and soon after the Tuesday lecturer at the same place. He resigned his ministerial employments as he advanced in years, which the people committed to his charge very much regretted. In the year 1783 his eyes gave him very much trouble, of the sight of which he was nearly deprived, but by means of a surgical operation, he was for some time enabled to resume his studies. But mortality is the inevitable lot of all men, and the growing infirmities of Mr Farmer brought him to the grave in 1787, in the 73rd year of his age.\n\nBy his last will he had ordered all his manuscripts to be burnt after his death, a circumstance which men of letters have just reason to lament. It is no doubt the duty of executors to pay attention to the will of the deceased; yet for the benefit of the Christian world they would have been justified in taking a certain latitude in the explanation of his meaning; as it does by no means appear probable that he meant to confine to the flames his manuscript entitled, \"A Dissertation on the Story of Balaam,\" which appeared written in a fair hand, as if manifestly intended for the press. When we say that Mr Farmer was a consummate scholar, we trust that his numerous and able works will fully justify the assertion; and his talents as a preacher were equally conspicuous. His voice was remarkable for its clearness and harmony, and his whole manner was peculiarly impressive. His piety was not morose, his conversation was lively, and his whole deportment was a beautiful transcript of his moral injunctions.","sp":19,"ep":19},{"h":"FARMER","t":"Richard, D.D., a scholar and critic of considerable\nconsiderable eminence, was the son of a hosier at Leicester, at which place he was born in the year 1735. Here he received the rudiments of his education, and was afterwards a student at Cambridge, and pensioner of Emmanuel college. He was considered as a young man well acquainted with books, was much esteemed among his friends, and looked upon as possessed of lively parts, even before he acquired any extraordinary reputation as a scholar. He was made B. A. in 1757, and M. A. in 1760. Seven years after this period, having been for some time a curate, he took the degree of B. D., and became a preacher at Whitechapel. Besides the attention he paid to the Grecian and Roman authors, he prosecuted the study of books in his own language, printed on black-letter, which laid the foundation of a work that added more to his literary reputation than any other performance. This was \"An Essay on the learning of Shakespeare,\" which he published in 1766. Men of letters had long turned their attention to the learning of Shakespeare, in order to ascertain its real extent. It could not be questioned that he was acquainted with the history and mythology of the ancients, but it was still a matter of dispute from what sources that acquaintance was derived. To obviate this difficulty, Mr Farmer's knowledge of books enabled him to demonstrate, that translations of the far greater part of classical authors were to be met with in the time of the celebrated dramatist; and as he proved that Shakespeare had even copied the blunders and errors of such translations, he made it manifest beyond the possibility of a rational doubt, that he was wholly incapable of consulting the originals. This essay passed through three editions in a very short time; was much admired for the sprightliness of its composition, and the generality were persuaded that he had fully established his point.\n\nThis performance brought him to much into notice, as to become extremely favourable to his professional advancement. By the influence of Bishop Hurd, he procured the chancellorship and a prebend in the cathedral of Lichfield, and in 1755 he was elected master of Emmanuel college, and took the degree of D. D. He was soon after constituted principal librarian to the university, and served in turn the office of vice-chancellor. He was made prebendary of Canterbury by Lord North, at that time prime minister, and Mr Pitt made him twice an offer of a bishopric; but the contraints and solemnity of the episcopal character were not congenial to his natural temper, on which account he declined the offer, and having resigned his office as prebendary, he accepted of a residuary fellowship of St Paul's. This obliged him to reside three months annually in London, which he spent with pleasure and advantage in the company of literary characters. From nature he inherited a fund of good humour, and was of such an obliging turn, that he buried party spirit in the satisfaction which he found in the performance of beneficent actions. Though in general an enemy to reforms of any kind, and anxious to preserve things as they were, both in church and state, he was instrumental in amending the police of Cambridge, especially as it related to the paving and lighting of the streets. At his instigation also, monumental sculpture was admitted into the cathedral of St Paul's, which will continue to exhibit a striking proof of national gratitude, and serve to cover the nakedness of the walls.\n\nIt was at one time the intention of Dr Farmer to publish a history of the town and antiquities of Leicester, the expenses to be defrayed by subscription; but either his independent circumstances, or a degree of native indolence, made him relinquish the design, and the few materials he had collected were given to Mr John Nichols, at that time engaged in an elaborate work on the same subject. After a painful illness of some length, Dr Farmer died at Emmanuel college in the month of September, 1797, in the 62nd year of his age. Dr Parr wrote an epitaph for his tombstone, in which we find the following testimony to his worth. \"Vir facetus et dulcis, festique fermonis, Graec\u00e8 et Latine doctus, in explicatione veterum Anglorum po\u00ebt\u00e6 subtiles et elegans.\" He had a considerable library, in which were a vast number of books purchased at the stalls of London, and afterwards disposed of for much more than they cost.","sp":19,"ep":20},{"h":"FARMER","t":"in mining, is the lord of the field, or one that farms the lot and cope of the king.","sp":20,"ep":20},{"h":"FARN ISLANDS","t":"two groups of little islands and rocks, 17 in number, lying opposite to Bamborough castle in Northumberland.

Their produce is kelp, feathers, and a few seals, which the tenant watches and shoots for the sake of the oil and skins. Some of them yield a little grass that may serve to feed a cow or two; which the people transport over in their little boats. The largest or Houfe island is about one mile in compass, and has a fort and a lighthouse. It contains about six or seven acres of rich pasture; and the shore abounds with good coals which are dug at the ebb of tide. St Cuthbert is said to have passed the two last years of his life on this island. A priory of Benedictines was afterwards established here, for six or eight monks, subordinate to Durham. A square tower, the remains of a church, and some other buildings, are still to be seen on this island; and a stone coffin, which is pretended to be that of St Cuthbert. At the north end of the isle is a deep chasm, from the top to the bottom of the rock, communicating with the sea; through which, in tempestuous weather, the water is forced with great violence and noise, and forms a fine jet d'eau of 60 feet high.

He was afterwards a soldier in the Low Countries; but being redu-\nFarnham, led to great want, returned to England, where wandering about for some time under the name of Thomas Bainrave, the anagram of his name, he settled at Mattock in Somersetshire, and taught a grammar-school with good reputation. He removed to London, and opened a school with large accommodations for young gentlemen. While he taught this school, he was made master of arts at Cambridge, and incorporated into the university of Oxford. Thence he removed, in 1636, to Seven-oaks in Kent; and taught the sons of several noblemen and gentlemen, who boarded with him, with great success, and grew rich. His works gained him reputation. Upon the breaking out of the civil commotions in 1641, he was cast into prison. It was debated in the house of commons, whether he should be sent to America; but this motion being rejected, he was removed to Ely-house in Holborn, and there he died in 1647. Mr Farnabie was a very eminent grammarian; and many writers have spoken with great approbation of his labours. M.

It was a magnificent structure, with deep moats, strong walls and towers at proper distances, and a fine park; but it is much decayed. The town, which has many handsome houses, and well paved streets, is governed by 12 masters or burgesses, of whom two are bailiffs, (chosen annually). They have the profit of the fairs and markets, and the assize of bread and beer; and hold a court every three weeks, which has power of trying and determining all actions under 40s.

The toll-duties here was once reckoned worth 200l. a-year; but it is much diminished, since the people about Chichester and Southampton began to send their meal to London by sea.

He was sent to Trinity College, Dublin; but his volatile disposition not relishing a college life, he betook himself to the stage; where, having dangerously wounded a brother-actor in a tragic scene, by forgetting to change his sword for a foil, it shocked him so much that he left the Dublin theatre and went to London. Here he procured a lieutenant's commission by the interest of the earl of Orery; which he held several years, and gave many proofs both of courage and conduct. In 1698, he wrote his first comedy called Love and a Bottle; which, for its sprightly dialogue and busy scenes, was well received. In the beginning of the year 1700, which was the jubilee year at Rome, he brought out his Constant Couple, or a Trip to the Jubilee; and suited Mr Wilks's talents so well in the character of Sir Harry Wildair, that the player gained almost as much reputation as the poet. This tempted him to continue it in another comedy called Sir Harry Wildair, or The sequel of the Trip to the Jubilee; in which Mrs Oldfield acquired great applause. In 1702, he published his Miscellanies, which contain a variety of humorous fallies of fancy. In 1703, appeared the Inconstant, or the Way to Win him; in 1704, a farce called the Stage-coach; in 1705, The Twin Rivals; and in 1706, the Recruiting Officer, founded on his own observations while on a recruiting party at Shrewsbury. His last comedy was the Beaux Stratagem, of which he did not live to enjoy the full success. Mr Farquhar married in 1703. Before that time his manner of life had been rather dissipated. The lady, therefore, who afterwards became his wife, having fallen violently in love with him, but judging that a gentleman of his humour would not easily be drawn into the trammels of matrimony, contrived to have it given out that she was possessed of a large fortune; and finding means afterwards to let Mr Farquhar know her attachment to him, interest and vanity got the better of his passion for liberty, and the lady and he were united in the nuptial bands. But how great was his disappointment, when he found all his prospects overclouded so early in life (for he was then no more than 24), by a marriage from which he had nothing to expect but an annual increase of family, and an enlargement of expense in consequence of it far beyond what his income would support. Yet, to his honour be it told, though he found himself thus deceived in a most essential particular, he never was known once to upbraid his wife with it; but generously forgave an imposition which love for him alone had urged her to, and even behaved to her with all the tenderness and delicacy of the most indulgent husband. Mrs Farquhar, however, did not very long enjoy the happiness she had purchased by this stratagem; for the circumstances that attended this union were in some respect perhaps the","sp":21,"ep":21},{"h":"FARQUHAR","t":"means of shortening the period of the captain's life.\n\nFor, finding himself considerably involved in debt in consequence of their increasing family, he was induced to make application to a certain noble courtier, who had frequently professed the greatest friendship for him, and given him the strongest assurances of his intended services. This pretended patron repeated his former declarations; but, expressing much concern that he had nothing at present immediately in his power, advised him to convert his commission into money to answer his present occasions, and assured him that in a short time he would procure another for him. Farquhar, who could not bear the thoughts of his wife and family being in distress, followed this advice, and sold his commission; but, to his great mortification and disappointment, found, on a renewal of his application to this inhuman nobleman, that he had either entirely forgotten, or had never intended to perform, the promise he had made him. This disheartening frustration of all his hopes fixed itself so strongly on our author's mind, that it soon brought on him a fever, though not a very sudden, declension of nature, which at length carried him off the stage of life in 1707, before he arrived at 30 years of age.\u2014His comedies are so diverting, and the characters so natural, that his plays still continue to be represented to full houses.","sp":21,"ep":22},{"h":"FARRIER","t":"one whose employment is to shoe horses, and cure them when diseased or lame.","sp":22,"ep":22},{"h":"FARRIERY","t":"INTRODUCTION.\n\nTHE term farrier is probably a corruption of ferrier, Fr. ferrant, from the verb ferrer, to shoe a horse; all these words being derived from the Latin ferrum, \"iron.\" There is no doubt that the word farrier was at first used to denote a person who shod horses, but as these persons were for a long period the only horse-doctors, the term was soon used in the more extensive sense of horse-doctor or horse-leech; and hence farriery came to signify the art of curing the diseases of horses.\n\nThere can be little doubt that the word farrier was originally spelt ferrier or ferrer; as we meet with this latter orthography in some of our older writers. Thus Blundeville, who wrote in the time of Queen Elizabeth, in his \"Address to the Gentlemen of England,\" book iv., has the following sentence:\n\n\"All horses, for the most part, do come into their decay, sooner than they should do, by one of these four wiles; that is to say, either for lacke of being well bred, or through the rashness of the rider, the negligence of the keeper, or else through the unskillfulness of the ferrer.\"\n\nAgain, the same author mentions, \"Martin Ghelly of Alton, called Martin Alman, chiefe ferrer to the queen's magistracy.\"\n\nFarriery, in the usual acceptation of the word, forms only a part of that more general art, which has been commonly called the veterinary art; by which is understood the art of medicine as applied to the inferior animals, which has been long called by the French l'art veterinaire, or medicinae veterinariae. This word veterinary is of very ancient date, being derived from the Latin veterinarius, which is used by Columella to denote a horse-doctor, or cattle-doctor. The term veterinary, being derived from veterinus, qu. veheterinus, a vehendo, carrying, is properly applicable only to beasts of burden; but veterinary medicine is now commonly employed in a more comprehensive sense, to denote the art of curing the diseases of domestic animals in general.\n\nThe French, who appear to have first used the term in this general sense, usually distinguish that part of the art which we call farriery by the appellation of Hippiatrique, from iatros, a horse, and urges, physicians. Thus, they have a Cours d'Hippiatrique, a Dictionnaire d'Hippiatrique, &c.\n\nAs there are considerable advantages attending the consideration of the diseases of the several domestic animals in the same treatise, we propose, in the present article, not to confine ourselves to the medical treatment of the horse, but to extend our views to the diseases of such other of the domestic animals, as are of most importance to man, particularly the ox, sheep, and dog.\n\nThe diseases of the horse, as they are better known, and more interesting, than those of the other domestic animals, will of course occupy the greatest share of our attention. The diseases of the dog have been as yet too little investigated for us to give a very satisfactory account of them; but as the subject of veterinary medicine has of late been much cultivated, it is probable that these, as well as some other obscure diseases of animals, may ere long receive some elucidation. If any considerable improvements or discoveries shall be made before the completion of our work, we shall notice them under Veterinary medicine.\n\nIt may be thought, that, considering veterinary medicine in this extensive point of view, it would have been more correct to defer the subject to the article Veterinary; but most of our readers who have been accustomed to see in our dictionary the article Farriery, will expect an account of, at least, the diseases of the horse, under this article, and would probably not be pleased to have this delayed till nearly the end of the work; besides, it is of little importance under which article the diseases of animals are treated of, as, when we have once defined our terms, we cannot be misunderstood, provided we always employ them in the sense of the definition. Again, as the term veterinary has departed from its original signification, there can be no objection to our employing the word farriery, a term that is more familiar, in the same general sense. In fact, it has been so employed by a late writer on the subject, Mr Feron, who has entitled his work, \"A new System of Farriery,\" though he professes to treat it of the horse, ox, and sheep.\n\nIn this article, then, we shall use farriery as synonymous with veterinary art, and shall consider both as\nthe art of preserving the health and curing the diseases of domestic animals.\n\nThe study of veterinary medicine must be an interesting object to every person, whole profession, or situation in society, requires him to attend to the comforts and diseases of domestic animals.\n\nTo the veterinary practitioner, the study of the principles of his art, the history of the diseases which he is called on to relieve, and the methods of treating them that have been found most successful, are as essential, as the study of the human economy, and the diseases to which it is exposed, are to the medical practitioner. A farrier who has studied his art scientifically, is as much superior to the ignorant empiric, to whose mercy the lives and limbs of horses and cattle are usually intrusted; as the regular physician to the illiterate quack, who puffs off his pernicious nostrums in every newspaper, and enriches himself, by imposing on the credulity and folly of the public. The necessity of a regular education to the farrier, as well as to the surgeon or physician, which had long been felt, has led to the institution of veterinary schools; at first in France, and within these few years in England. Of these we shall presently give an account.\n\nTo the farmer and country gentleman this subject must be highly interesting. They will find their account in being able themselves to superintend the management of their horses, dogs, sheep, and cattle, so as best to preserve their health, and relieve their diseases, without relying implicitly on their grooms, huntmen, and farriers, herdsmen and cattle-doctors, who are probably either notoriously ignorant, or are induced from interested views, or a fellow-feeling, to prolong the cure, and pick the pockets of their masters (A). These gentlemen therefore cannot employ a part of their leisure time to greater advantage than in acquiring a knowledge of the diseases of domestic animals.\n\nThe medical practitioner who wishes to derive an advantage from analogy in some of the obscure diseases to which the human frame is subject, and which would probably receive considerable elucidation from a comparison with similar diseases that affect the inferior animals, must engage with peculiar interest, in a research that promises so well to repay his labour. \"It is not a little remarkable, (say the editors of a well-conducted medical journal), that the diseases of horses, cattle, and sheep, which occur so frequently, and are so seriously lamented, should be so imperfectly understood. No greater benefit could be conferred on physical science than a complete history of the diseases of our domestic animals, especially if given by any one endowed by nature with superior acuteness, and a talent for observation, improved by habit and experience; who could describe the symptoms and appearances of the different disorders, point out the analogies with those incident to the human body, detect those minute circumstances which serve to distinguish them, class them under their proper heads, and correct all the confusion in which they now lie involved. Veterinary medicine has lately occupied some share of attention, chiefly as relating to horses, and as a distinct pursuit from the general study of all the diseases of animals, but considered apart from any relation or inquiry concerning the treatment of the morbid states of the human system. It is in this last point of view, that comparative pathology seems to offer so many subjects worthy investigation; and, when looked upon in this light, it strikes us as one of those studies quae ad non pertinent, et quae nefas malum efficiunt.*\n\nWe shall see, from the historical sketch of farriery, Farriery which will immediately be given, that the art never made any considerable progress, or assumed anything like a scientific form, till it attracted the attention of men who had made the human economy their study. Almost the only rational improvements, that have been made in the art, were either suggested or carried into effect by medical men; and nothing will contribute so much to its perfection as the interest which the profession has lately shewed to it, and the attention that has of late been paid to the study of comparative anatomy and pathology.\n\nThe healing art in general must profit by this. There is not only an intimate connection between the structure of man and that of the inferior animals; but, especially in those that have been domesticated, the diseases of both are nearly allied.\n\nThe murrains, that in the early part of the last century so frequently attacked the horned cattle throughout almost all Europe, nearly depopulating most of the farms, are very analogous to some of the epidemic diseases of man; and pestilential diseases among cattle, have not unfrequently been the forerunners of similar epidemics among the human race. Homer, in describing the plague that harassed the Grecian camp, in consequence of the affront given by Agamemnon to the priest of Apollo, says that the domestic animals were first affected.\n\nOn mules and dogs th' infection first began,\nAnd last the vengeful arrows fix'd in man.\"","sp":22,"ep":23},{"h":"FARRIERY","t":"History. horses, were, as in France, chiefly riding-masters; and of these, the first that seems worthy of notice is Blundeville, who lived, as we have already observed, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. His work appears to have been principally compiled from the writings of Vegetius, and other ancient writers; and it contains little that can entitle it to any distinction, as a work of utility. It may, however, be perused as a literary curiosity.\n\nThe names of many writers, after Blundeville, are mentioned by those who have written on the history of farriery; but they are all still inferior to Blundeville, except perhaps Burdon, on whose work, notes were written by Dr Bracken.\n\nAbout the end of the 17th century, lived Gervase Markham, a name in high repute amongst grooms and farriers, even to this day. He published a work on Farriery, which he called his Maister Piece, and which is one of the strangest compounds of nonsense and absurdity that has ever appeared on the subject.\n\nIn the opinion of Mr Lawrence, Markham was nothing more than a mere vulgar and illiterate compiler; and his works, some few things excepted, are stuffed with all the execrable trash that had ever been invented by any writer, or practised by any farrier, ancient or modern, on the subject of horses. It is necessary, however, that we do justice to the character of Gervase Markham; he certainly possessed a species of merit which has not descended to all his successors, the copyists and plagiarists; he very honestly gives the names of those authors from whom he derives his knowledge.\n\nSome years after Markham, Michael Baret published a book, which he called the Vineyard of Horsemanship. This we have never seen, but it appears to be of some repute. The next writer on this subject, is the Duke of Newcastle, who gave to the world a most superb work on an improved method of breeding and managing horses. This work bears a very high character, not only from the name of the illustrious person by whom it was composed, but from its own intrinsic merit. The duke is quoted with respect by most succeeding writers; and his work has been translated into French, German, Dutch, and Italian. It chiefly relates to horsemanship, but as it contains some excellent observations and maxims on the breeding of horses, it naturally comes to be considered here.\n\nIn the latter end of the 17th century, Andrew Snape, who was farrier to Charles II, published a large work on the anatomy of the horse, illustrated with many copperplates. These plates appear not to have been taken from his own dissection, but are mostly copied from preceding authors, especially from Ruini. Mr Blaine, however, is mistaken in asserting that some of them are copied from Saunier, as Snape's work was published in 1683, whereas Saunier's did not appear, (according to Vitet) before 1734. It is said that Snape had projected a larger work on the diseases of horses, but this he did not live to execute.\n\nEarly in the 18th century, farriery experienced a considerable improvement from the writings of Mr William Gibbon. This gentleman had been a surgeon in the army, but relinquished that situation for the practice of farriery, which he probably expected to find more profitable. Mr Blaine places this writer in the middle of the last century; but his first work entitled \"The Farrier's New Guide,\" was certainly published previous to the year 1721, as we have seen a second edition of it advertised in that year. This was the most scientific work on the diseases of horses, that had then appeared in the English, or perhaps any language. The detail of symptoms is in general just, accurate, and the plan of treatment advised is for the most part very judicious. The anatomical part of Mr Gibbon's work is not so valuable, being frequently incorrect, and evidently not the result of his own observation. The Farriers Guide was soon followed by The Farriers Dispensatory, containing an account of the remedies employed in farriery, and the means of preparing and exhibiting them. This work is far inferior to the former, and is now of little use. In 1721, Mr Gibbon published a small work on The True Method of Dieting Horses, which contains some judicious remarks on the means of preserving the health of this useful animal; as also on the breeding of horses; with some observations on their external form, their sagacity, and habits. This book must have been very valuable at the time of its publication, but is now in a great measure superseded by Clark and other later writers.\n\nAbout 1759, Mr Gibbon published a larger work, On the Diseases of Horses, in which he has brought together the substance of his former works on farriery, with some improvements. There is, we believe, a later edition of it in two vols. Mr Gibbon must be considered as one of those to whom farriery is most indebted for its improvements. He was almost the first, at least in this country, to rescue the art from the hands of the illiterate empirics, to point out their blunders, and correct their errors. Mr John Lawrence, who has given a very full account of Mr Gibbon in the first volume of his treatise on horses, perhaps goes too far in ranking him on an equality with some of our present writers; while these again have erred as much on the other side, in detracting from the merits of a man to whom they are all more or less indebted for much of their most valuable matter.\n\nGibson was followed in his plan for the improvement Bracken of farriery by Dr Bracken, a physician at Lancaster, and a pupil of Boerhaave, who published a work called Farriery Improved. \"Bracken (says Mr Blaine) was physician of great abilities and extensive knowledge in his profession; a man of considerable erudition, a sportman, and a wit of a peculiar cast. His works have by some been as much admired and read for the peculiar style in which they are written, and that peculiar freedom and non-obsequiousness of rule or form, as for the real information they contain.\n\nThough there is great ingenuity in his writings, and though in many respects he improved upon Gibbon, yet as a practical work it was much inferior; nor was his information given in a way that could benefit the generality of his readers: independent of his style being too peculiar, and his reasoning too arbitrary for farriers, his manner of pursuing his subject was so defunctory, that few readers had patience to follow him. Nevertheless his works, which were several, and passed through many editions, have raised him a fame that can only die with the science.\"\n\nThese two writers may justly be considered as the fathers of English farriery; they established their system\non the only sure foundation, the analogy which prevailed between the structure, economy, and diseases of man and of brutes. The best practice in this country has been derived from their instructions; and their works formed an example, by following which, later writers have greatly improved the art.\n\nThe next writer of reputation was Mr John Bartlet, also a medical man, who about the middle of the last century published his Gentleman's Farriery, and afterwards his Veterinary Pharmacopoeia. Bartlet had formed himself on the model of Gibbon and Bracken, the best parts of whose writings he has given in his farriery, condensed into a more compendious view. He also enriched his work by the most material improvements of Lafoffe, whose memoirs on shoeing and on glanders, he translated into English.\n\nSoon after Bartlet, appeared Mr William Ofmer, a surgeon and a sportsman, who practised farriery in Oxford street, London. He was the principal means of introducing into this country the French mode of shoeing, which, in his treatise on the lameness of horses, he adapted to the English manners, so as to render service, what had been before nearly useless and impracticable. Mr Ofmer's mode of shoeing will be mentioned hereafter. From the above works many compilations were soon made; these were generally below mediocrity, amongst which, one called the Farrier's Dictionary, though a very wretched composition, met with a very rapid fate. We must except from these a small treatise by a Mr Blount, surgeon, which is above the common class, and worthy of notice, from an ingenious contrivance, illustrated by a plate, for securing a fractured limb.\n\nIn the year 1746, Dr Richard Brockleby, a friend of Dr Mead, published a pamphlet on the disorder that just before raged among horned cattle. It should seem that this book is very little known beyond the circle of medical men, as we have not seen it referred to by any writer on the diseases of cattle.\n\nBrockleby was followed on the same subject by Dr Layard. We shall speak particularly of these two authors, when we come to treat of the murrains.\n\nAbout 30 years ago, Mr James Clark, farrier to his majesty for Scotland, published an ingenious Treatise on Shoeing, and on the Diseases of the Feet of Horses. This was soon followed by his Treatise on the Prevention of Diseases Incidental to Horses. By this latter work Mr Clark has acquired much reputation, as a scientific farrier, and a sensible writer. It contains some judicious observations on stables, diet, and exercise, on blood-letting, rowels, and fetons; with remarks on the uses and administration of the more common remedies. Mr Clark's book is in general well calculated to produce a more judicious and humane method of treating horses, than usually prevails. But it would have been more useful, had the author omitted much of the theoretic discussion, into which he has entered on some parts of the animal economy, on the nature of disease, and on the action of remedies. Mr Clark is a good practical writer, but his theory is often very lame, or very obscure. He had an easy opportunity of attending the medical lectures, which were taught at Edinburgh in his youth, when the humoral pathology and the theory of Boerhaave were in full vogue. Mr Clark has here and there interposed among his practical remarks much of this old leaven. But as he probably had not received such a previous liberal education as might fit him for the judicious application of what he heard, he is often deficient in that theoretical knowledge which he takes so much pains to display.\n\nSome years before the publication of Mr Clark's last Lord Pembroke mentioned treatise, viz. in 1778, Lord Pembroke favour-broke ed the public with his excellent dissertation on the management of dragoon horses, with some remarks on shoeing. This work is entitled, Military Equitation, or a Method of Breaking Horses. Though the observations, contained in his lordship's work, were intended for the use of the British cavalry, they are for the most part applicable to horses in general, and well merit the attention of farriers and others concerned in the management of horses. We do not well understand what Mr Blaine means by affirming that Lord Pembroke derived the principle of his medical hints from Mr Clark. If he means that his lordship borrowed anything from Mr Clark's treatise on preventing the diseases of horses, he is certainly mistaken, as the first edition of this treatise, which we believe has not been reprinted, appeared in 1788, and in it Mr Clark often quotes Lord Pembroke's work (c).\n\nMuch about this time Mr Stubbs published his elegant plates of the anatomy of the horse, of which work, as the production of an artist, we cannot speak too highly. Mr Stubbs is a very eminent painter of animals, and to much professional excellence in this capacity, he has added a considerable share of anatomical knowledge. Hence his figures are in general extremely correct, and will be found very useful to those who have not the opportunity of availing themselves of real subjects.\n\nOne of the latest writers on the subject of farriery is Taplin. Mr Taplin, who for some time enjoyed a considerable reputation, both as a practitioner and as a writer. But this reputation has been materially fulfilled, since it was discovered, that Mr Taplin is not only ignorant of the anatomy of the horse, but has liberally copied from those very writers whom he takes every opportunity to vilify and abuse. As from his flagrant plagiarism and arrogance, Mr Taplin has well deserved the dressing which he has recently received from several late writers, we shall turn him over into the hands of one of his rivals, who does not seem disposed to show him any mercy.\n\n\"This gentleman likewise began his career as a surgeon, but turned aside to the then more profitable track of farriery. Mr Taplin set out by decrying all that had gone before him, all that were in practice with him, and in fact everything that has been done by anyone since. Yet Mr Taplin's works are said to be compilations from those very authors whom he abuses; and, in some instances, after abusing egregiously, he copies literally.\n\n(c) We find that Lord Pembroke's work was first published about 1761. The edition mentioned in the text is, we believe, the second.\nUnfortunately for this gentleman, from some late improvements, the people of this country have learned to distinguish in this art, as well as in others, between scientific investigation and verbose quackery. Had Mr Taplin set out by studying the structure and economy of the animal, he might, and undoubtedly would, have proved an ornament to the profession; but when he permits his works to go through so many editions, in the face of criticisms from all quarters, with a chapter on diffeles of a part that has no existence in the horse, i.e., the gall bladder, we must be aware that he is entirely ignorant of that, upon which every pretension to professional merit must be grounded. Mr Taplin indulges himself in the most unrestrained freedoms in speaking of those who have gone before him, yet copies verbatim from them; he cannot wonder, therefore, that he has been treated with considerable severity by later writers; nor can he be surprised that a practice so begun and so continued has ended as his has.*\n\nMr Taplin is the author of several works on farriery.\n\nHis first publication was, we believe, The Stable Directory, which had a great sale. He next published a larger work, in two volumes; and lately he has sent out a small pamphlet called Multum in parvo, which is supposed to be merely intended to advance the sale of his prepared horse medicines.\n\nThe end of the 18th century will ever be memorable in the history of farriery, for the establishment of an institution for the public teaching of the veterinary art in England, in imitation of those schools in France of which we have already spoken.\n\nThe veterinary college owes its origin to M. St Bel, a French gentleman, born at Lyons, and who was first junior assistant to the professor of the Royal Veterinary College there, and afterwards professor of anatomy at the veterinary college of Montpelier. This gentleman came to Britain in 1788, and published proposals for establishing a veterinary school in this kingdom. These proposals did not, at that time, meet with encouragement; but two years after, when M. St Bel, driven from his native country by the horrors of the revolution, again visited England, his proposals were taken again into consideration by an agricultural society at Ockham in Hampshire. It had been the intention of this society, to send two young men to France, to study the veterinary art scientifically; but on hearing the proposals of M. St Bel, they abandoned this idea, and appointed a committee to consult with him on the best means of forming a school for teaching the art in this kingdom. To this school they gave the name of the Veterinary College of London; and M. St Bel was appointed the first professor.\n\nThe following gentlemen were appointed to the management of this institution.\n\nHis Grace the Duke of Northumberland, President.\n\nEarl Grosvenor,\nEarl Morton,\nEarl of Oxford,\nLord Rivers,\nSir George Baker, Bart.\nSir T. C. Bunbury, Bart. M. P.\nSir W. Fordyce,\nJohn Hunter, Esq.\n\nSir John Ingleby, Bart. M. P.\nSir H. P. St John Mildmay, Bart.\nG. M. Alcough, Esq.\nMr John Baynes,\nMr J. Burgess,\nRev. T. Burgess,\nRev. J. Cook.\nDr Adair Crawford,\nJohn Gretton, Esq.\nDr Hamilton,\nMr Rennet,\nDr D. Mapleton,\nGranville Penn, Esq.\nMr William Stone,\nRichard Tophane, Esq.\nDr Williams,\nJ. Wollaston, Esq.\n\nMessrs Ranford,\nMoreland,\nand Hammerly,\n\nA house was taken, for the purpose of the institution, and pupils were admitted to board in the house.\n\nThe success of this institution, at first, by no means answered the expectations of the founders. It appears that M. St Bel was prevented, by the embarrassed state of his circumstances, from executing the office of professor, with that ardour and activity, which was necessary to the reputation of the infant school; and indeed it seems, from the specimen he has left us of his professional abilities, that these were not adequate to the office he had undertaken. He possessed considerable industry, and it is probable that, had he lived, he would have succeeded better than his outset had promised. But, in the year 1793, he was attacked with an illness, which proved fatal in about a fortnight.\n\nM. St Bel left behind him several works, viz. An Essay on the Geometrical Proportions of Eclipse. Lectures on the Elements of Farriery. The Art of Horsehoeing, with Observations on the Difficulties of the Feet. And a volume of posthumous works.\n\nWe do not pretend to give our own opinion as to the merits of these works, as we have not seen them. But it is said that the Essay is merely an application of the proportions long ago laid down by Bourgelat in his Elements d'Hippiatrique, to a particular case; and that many of his measurements are incorrect. Mr Blaine roundly taxes him with translating Laffol\u00e9 to furnish matter for his Elements, and refers for proof of this to the description and treatment of quitor in St Bel's Elements, and Laffol\u00e9's Dictionnaire d'Hippiatrique.\n\nMr Blaine brings many other instances of M. St Bel's want of information and science, for which we must refer our readers to Mr Blaine's Outlines of the Veterinary Art.\n\nOn the death of M. St Bel, there appears to have been a competition for the vacant chair, between two gentlemen, who were both well qualified to fill it, Mr Edward Coleman and Mr Morecroft. Both of these gentlemen had been bred to surgery, and the former had acquired much reputation by an ingenious Essay on Suspended Respiration. The latter was lately returned from France, where he had been studying the veterinary art. We are not acquainted with the particulars.\nculars of this competition; but the choice of the subscribers fixed on Mr Coleman, under whose management the college has acquired considerable reputation.\n\nThe election of Mr Coleman was followed by some new regulations. An anatomical theatre was fitted up, with dissecting rooms for the use of the students. A medical committee was also appointed for the purpose of examining the pupils, who had completed their education at the college, previously to their receiving a diploma as veterinary surgeons. This committee, in committee, 1801, was composed of the following gentlemen:\n\nDr Fordyce, senior physician to St Thomas's hospital.\nDr Ralph, physician to Guy's hospital.\nDr Babington, Do.\nDr Bailie, physician to St George's hospital.\nMr Cline, surgeon to St Thomas hospital.\nMr Home, surgeon to St George's hospital.\nMr Ashley Cooper, surgeon to Guy's hospital.\nMr Abernethy, surgeon to Bartholomew's hospital.\nMr Wilson, lecturer on anatomy and surgery; and Mr Coleman, professor of the college.\n\nThe following are the regulations of this useful institution as published in the year 1801.\n\nThe subscribers of the veterinary college pay two guineas per annum, or twenty guineas for life. For this subscription each subscriber is entitled to send, when sick or lame, any number of horses to the veterinary stables, where no charges are made for medicines, attendance, or operations. The subscriber pays only for the keep and shoeing of his horse, which is generally less than the actual expense incurred by the college. A committee of subscribers is appointed to examine the quality of the forage, and to regulate the price of the keep of horses. For some years past, the subscribers paid only 2s. 6d. per night; but in consequence of the great advance in hay, corn, and straw, and the college, by this moderate charge, having sustained a considerable loss, the keep of horses is now fixed at 3s. per night. A separate committee inspects the accounts of the college, and three times in the year reports to the general meeting the state of the finances of the college. No horses but those the property of subscribers are admitted into the veterinary stables; but the professor is allowed private practice, and horses not belonging to subscribers may be sent to the college for the professor's opinion.\n\nThe horses not intended to be left in the stables of the college may be sent for the professor's advice on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, from twelve to two o'clock. Where medicines are requisite, they are prepared for subscribers' horses at very reduced prices; and the college receives all emoluments which may arise from the sale of horse medicines.\n\nThe expenses incurred by subscribers, for shoeing, for the keep of horses, or for medicines, must be paid for before the animal be taken from the college. And as some losses have been sustained from the strict letter of this regulation not having been always attended to, the clerk has now received positive orders from the committee, not to allow any horse, before all the expenses are paid, to be taken from the college. The horses are placed under the direction of the professor, who resides on the spot, and the medicines he prescribes are compound by a proper person employed for that purpose.\n\nAs the great object of the veterinary establishment is to form a national school for the improvement of farriery, pupils paying twenty guineas are admitted into the college to learn the veterinary art.\n\nLectures are given by the professor on the formation, economy, and diseases of horses, and other domestic animals; and most of the eminent medical teachers in London, with a liberality peculiar to themselves, have allowed the veterinary pupils to hear their lectures without any fee or reward. The veterinary students attend lectures on human anatomy and physiology, on the principles and practice of surgery, on the materia medica, and chemistry, and practice of physic.\n\nThe period requisite for obtaining a competent knowledge of the veterinary art, is regulated by the talents, previous information, and industry of the individual pupil. The students continue to attend the college until they are examined and approved by the medical committee. Those pupils who are duly qualified receive a diploma; but those who are found on examination to be deficient, are rejected. There are four general examinations in the year. When examined and approved, if no objections are made to their conduct, during their study at the veterinary college, they may be recommended to any regiment of cavalry, not already provided with a veterinary surgeon.\n\nNo fees of any kind are allowed by the college to any of the servants of subscribers; neither are the servants of the college permitted to receive any perquisites from the subscribers.\n\nA veterinary college has also been established near Birmingham, and it is said that others are in contemplation in other parts of the empire.\n\nThe advantages that have already accrued from this establishment, to veterinary medicine in general, and to our national cavalry in particular, are very considerable. Almost every regiment of cavalry has been supplied from the college, with a veterinary surgeon; and many of these gentlemen have published works which, for the most part, do much credit to themselves and their academy.\n\nIn 1798, Mr Coleman published the first volume, and in 1802, the second, of Observations on the Structure, Oeconomy, and Diseases of the Foot of the Horse. This is a most useful and valuable work, but it is too splendid and costly, especially the second volume, for general circulation. The first volume contains a very full account of the method of shoeing practised at the veterinary college, of which we shall give an abstract hereafter.\n\nAbout this period, appeared also a pamphlet by Mr Coleman, On the Formation and Uses of the natural Frog of the Horse, with the description of an artificial Frog.\n\nIn 1801, appeared the first number of the Veterinary Transactions, published by order of the subscribers. This pamphlet commences with a long introduction, stating the object of the institution, the progress which it had made, and the causes that tended to prevent its complete success. These originate partly in the party opposition of the common farriers, who deem it their interest to do all in their power to circumvent the views of the subscribers: but they have fill more been derived from the underhand malice of grooms and servants, with whose interest the institution, from the liberal manner in which\nwhich it is conducted, must certainly be full. The body of the pamphlet is occupied with a very neat view of the consequences and treatment of wounds of joints, and other circumcised cavities, and it is concluded by an account of the regulations of the college (see No. 77.) the list of the medical committee, a list of the examined and approved veterinary surgeons that had at that time passed at the college, and lists of the then managers and subscribers to the institution.\n\nThe first pupil of the college, as we believe, who distinguished himself as an author, was Mr Bracey Clarke; who, in the third volume of the Linnean Transactions, published a very ingenious paper on the boots in horses and cattle, of which we shall speak hereafter.\n\nAbout the same time appeared a small volume on Veterinary Pathology, by Mr Riding, veterinary surgeon to the 18th regiment of dragoons.\n\nIn 1822, Mr John Denny, of the 10th dragoons, published a small volume on the Diseases of Horses. In this work Mr Denny has in general given the principles and practice of the veterinary college, and has illustrated and confirmed these by his own attentive observations and long experience.\n\nIn the same year appeared a very neat Compendium of the Veterinary Art, by Mr James White of the 1st Dragoons. This is only a pocket volume, and of course is very concise; but the author has given a very comprehensive view of the nature and treatment of diseases, and of the late improvement in the art of shoeing introduced into the veterinary college; and the work will be found an useful companion to the young practitioner. This volume also contains the substance of a former work, by the same author, on the Anatomy and Physiology of the Horse's Foot. In the year 1824, Mr White published the Veterinary Materia Medica, containing a brief description of the various substances employed in farriery, with an account of their particular effects on the body of the horse. He occasionally introduces some pertinent remarks on the diseases of the horse; and in the latter part of the volume, comprising the veterinary pharmacopeia, he has given a number of the best and most scientific recipes that he had seen. This work may be considered as the second volume of Mr White's compendium; and the author considered the two volumes, as forming a complete system of the veterinary medicine. Though we are disposed to think very favourably of these volumes, as a practical compendium, we cannot help thinking that Mr White might have contented himself with that modest title without assuming the more pompous one of a system. We must also remark, that the materia medica, which is not large, is unnecessarily swelled by the admission of many articles that seem to have been introduced merely to tell us, that they are never used in the veterinary practice.\n\nMr White is also the author of an Address to the Royal First Devon Yeoman Cavalry respecting the management of their horses, when employed on actual service.\n\nIn the year 1802, or we believe a little earlier, a work of considerable elegance was published by Mr Richard Lawrence, veterinary surgeon at Birmingham. As we have not seen this work, we must copy the following account of it from Mr Blaine. \"It is much to be regretted that a gentleman who possesses so much ingenuity, should pass over subjects of such importance in such a light cursory manner. The description and treatment of some diseases occupy fewer lines than to treat the subject in such manner as to prove useful; they would require pages. The plates are elegant, and extremely well designed, particularly those that regard the proportions and paces of the horse; those that regard the internal structure and diseases are not so happy. The diction is very superior. As a cabinet work, it is most certainly elegant and interesting; but as a useful assistant to the art itself, it does not rank too high.\"\n\nIn the same year was published the first part of a Boardman's dictionary of the veterinary art by Mr Thomas Boardman of the third regiment of Dragoons. This work was intended to be completed in fifteen parts. The author seems to have availed himself of the latest and best information on the several articles that compose his work; and he has introduced into it a variety of subjects on the principles of general medicine.\n\nOne of the latest publications by pupils of the veterinary college, is a new system of farriery by Mr John Feron, veterinary surgeon to the thirteenth regiment of Light Dragoons. This work is printed in quarto, and affords a good instance to what an extent a small quantity of matter may be carried by the modern typographical improvements of large type, broad margins, wide spaces, and frequent breaks. The work is indeed very elegant both in type, and in plates. It also contains some useful information on the external structure of the horse, with a view to point out and illustrate what appeared to the author to be the most perfect form of a blood horse, with the blemishes and defects which appeared most likely to impede his velocity. This appears to be the best part of the work, and is well illustrated by the plates. The latter half of the book is occupied with the consideration of diseases; and here we are led, from the author's title page, to expect an account not only of the diseases of horses, but of the principal epidemics to which cattle, sheep, &c., are subject. These epidemics are however discussed in the course of seventeen pages; but we are given to understand that the author intends in a future publication to give a full comparative description, with the proper mode of treatment of every disease that affects domestic animals. Mr Feron's observations are rendered of much less utility than they would otherwise have been, by the want of a proper index, or table of contents.\n\nThese are, we believe, the principal publications that have proceeded from the pupils of the veterinary college. A few other works on veterinary medicine still remain to be considered. In 1796, a very elegant work on horses was published by S. Freeman, Esq., whose character is given by Mr Blaine as an amateur in the manege, and a gentleman of fortune, learning and great ingenuity. This publication consisted in a description of the structure and economy of the foot, accompanied with a set of plates highly finished in Skelton's best style. The subjects were directed under the inspection of Mr Home, or an assistant; and except some slight errors in the ligaments of the navicular bone, appear very correct. This publication, for the elegance of its engravings, and the general spirit of the whole, will be long without a competitor. It recommends a very ingeniu-\nous mode of shoeing, and the economy of the foot is likewise very ingenious.\n\nAbout the same time Mr John Lawrence published a small volume on horses, chiefly composed of extracts from St. Bel, Ofner, Clarke, and Lord Pembroke; and in 1798, this gentleman brought forward his philosophical and practical treatise on horses, a work which is as remarkable for the good sense and humanity of the author, as for the whimsical eccentricity and angry irritability which he occasionally displays. The work embraces a great variety of subjects. It commences with an account of the principal former writers on farriery, in which high eulogies are paid to the memory of Gibson and Bracken, and a very violent attack is made on the ill-starred Mr Taplin. The latter part of the work contains Mr Lawrence's system of veterinary practice, which is chiefly taken from his favourite authors, as Mr Lawrence seems at that time not to have had much practical experience. The work also contains some remarks on the diseases of horned cattle, on the treatment of cows, and on calving.\n\nMr Lawrence has since, in 1805, published a separate treatise on cattle, in which the management of neat cattle, sheep, and swine, are handled in a matter-of-fact manner; and a much fuller account of diseases and their treatment is given than could be expected in his former treatise. We venture to recommend Mr Lawrence's works as amongst the most instructive and most entertaining that we have met with.\n\nSome years ago there appeared a work on the description and treatment of the diseases of cattle, by a Mr Downing, a professor of cattle medicine; which, though very expensive, sold very fast, and was very generally esteemed amongst farmers and graziers. We have not seen this work; but from the account of it that is given by Mr Blaine in his outlines, it should seem that it abounds with important errors, and frequently inculcates a dangerous mode of practice. We cannot here enumerate the particular examples brought by Mr Blaine in proof of his assertions, but we shall notice the most important of them under their proper heads.\n\nPerhaps no part of veterinary medicine has been so little cultivated in this country, as that which considers the diseases of cattle. There is scarcely a work on this subject in the English language that is worth perusal. We cannot give a better idea of the little value that must be placed on these works than by the following extract from Mr Lawrence's treatise on cattle:\n\n\"I have never yet seen any of these cattle doctoring books, which appeared to me to be written bona fide. Well-intentioned ignorance, if not entitled to respect, is at least venial; but the slightest examination of most of these printed guardians of the health of cattle, by a person qualified to judge, will evince, that they are premeditated impostures, goods merely varnished up for sale. They have either the names of living men attached to them, who, in the strongest probability, never either did, or could write a line of them, or they are published in the name of some one of the mighty dead, among cow-doctors, who most unfortunately died at last, after sixty years practice. One would expect to find something original and valuable, from this long-continued and extensive practice; but the disappointment is always complete. The chief of that which we meet with, consists of transcriptions from former writers, interlarded with learned, medical, and physical dissertations, perhaps found and good enough in their place, to which are loosely and clumsily tacked the most nonsensical and burlesque appendages by Mr Editor. The medicinal forms in these books, are frequently the strangest jumble that imagination can conceive. Articles of a directly opposite nature and intention, are blended in one mass, which must inevitably act upon the animal system with an effect similar to that of two men pulling at opposite ends of a cord. We find balsam of Peru and Glauber's salts married together, the intent of which, no doubt must be, as a Suffolk farrier once described to the late Mr Ruth, \"a kind of heater, and a kind of cooler.\" Indeed the far greater number of the prescriptions wear rather the appearance of having been fabricated for the use of the book, than of having ever been used and approved in real practice. One truly laughable custom was introduced by the book published under the name of Topham's old one. It was to subjoin to every prescription of note, a fact character, conceived in the most high founding terms of panegyric, at the same time, with a choice of words, at once so droll, and so gravely professional, with so formal an arrangement, that he must be a man far surpassing me in gravity, grave as I naturally am, who can peruse them without bursting into laughter. It must not be denied, however, that these books contain a number of useful hints, relative to the management and dieting of cattle, whether or not such may have originated with the doctor, or have been introduced by the editor. They may also, to a certain degree, be confounded as to the symptoms of diseases, although by no means to be implicitly relied on even in that respect. So far they have their use. With regard to doctoring, as it is termed, or prescribing medicines to cattle, they are most truly blind guides; and when, unfortunately, they are set to lead the blind, the fate of both parties may be very readily anticipated. I am speaking of books, which have been published within the last half century. As to the ancient veterinary writers, none of them, not even the celebrated Vegetius, were medical men, and their medical practice is utterly beneath modern notice. The same kind of books of our old English writers, consist of a strange medley of ancient practice with various sage additions of their own. A rational man cannot read over some of their prescriptions without amazement, nor a humane one without extreme pity for the harried victim of such monstrous practice. By the way, they who, for interested purposes, fabricate pretended cattle medicines, of the effects of which they are careless or ignorant, commit an act of gross inhumanity and crime, in too probably adding to the load of sufferings of a helpless animal already tortured by disease. One of the greatest curiosities we meet with in the old books, is their grand universal specific. It seems as though they judged by a kind of compound arithmeticico-medical logic, that all medicines being conjoined and multiplied one into the other, the product must necessarily be the prevention or cure of all diseases.\"\n\nMr Lawrence has excepted from the above general condemnation, a work lately published by Mr Culley, of Northumberland; which, he says, ought to be in the hands of every farmer in Great Britain. He considers it as the only original work in our language, and, as containing in a small compass, a most valuable fund of information.\nIn the year 1800, Mr Morecroft, the rival candidate with Mr Coleman for the professorship of the veterinary college, published a small pamphlet containing a cursory account of the various methods of shoeing horses, with incidental observations. This work displays considerable ingenuity. We shall notice Mr Morecroft's method of shoeing by and by.\n\nIn 1802, appeared Mr Blaine's Outlines of the Veterinary Art, or the Principles of Medicine as applied to a knowledge of the structure, functions, and economy of the horse, the ox, the sheep, and the dog; and in a more scientific and successful manner of treating their various diseases; in two volumes. Mr Blaine is well known as a practitioner of veterinary medicine, and as the advertiser of a specific against the distemper in dogs. In his Outlines, Mr Blaine, after giving a sketch of the history of medicine in general, enters on the history of veterinary medicine in particular, which he details at considerable length; not however, without several errors, some of which we have already pointed out. He next proceeds to lay down very briefly what he conceives to be the proper means for the attainment of the veterinary art. Then follows a long section on a subject which we should scarcely expect to find in a work of this kind, the history of chemistry. The first part concludes with a sketch of comparative anatomy, in which the structure and economy of the ox, sheep, and dog are passed over much too lightly. The second part, which occupies the rest of the first volume, and one-half of the second, is taken up with a very minute account of the anatomy of the horse, with some observations on the economy and uses of the several parts. We consider this as the best part of Mr Blaine's book; but we think that he has made it unnecessarily prolix, as by carrying it to such an extent, he has not left room for a satisfactory account of diseases, which occupy the rest of the second volume. Here we cannot but consider the author as very defective. Neither the symptoms nor the treatment are given with that accuracy or precision, which the public had a right to expect from a practitioner of Mr Blaine's long experience. Many of the diseases of cattle, sheep, and especially of dogs, are passed over in a manner that is by no means satisfactory. The work is written in a very slovenly manner, and is everywhere filled with an ostentatious parade of medical phraseology that must render it nearly unintelligible to the generality of readers. In his receipts, Mr Blaine has for the most part adopted the new nomenclature, which, however we may approve in medical formulae, we cannot think calculated for the meridian of farriers. We, however, by no means intend to insinuate that Mr Blaine's work is without merit; it certainly contains much valuable matter; but we must repeat that it is not what we should have expected from the advantages of information and experience which Mr Blaine appears to have possessed.\n\nIn the following year, Mr Blaine published a smaller work, which he calls a Domestic Treatise on the diseases of horses and dogs, which appears to be chiefly an abridgement of the Outlines, with a sort of advertisement for the sale of Mr Blaine's patent medicine.\n\nIn 1802 appeared a General View of the Agriculture of the county of Peebles, by the Rev. Charles Findlater, minister of the parish of Newlands, in that county. This work, though intended merely as a local survey of the state of agriculture and improvements in a small district, abounds with much excellent matter that must prove of general utility. Besides the observations which the ingenious author has made, on the general management of live stock, in the body of his work, he has added in one of his appendices some valuable information respecting some of the most important diseases of sheep, which are partly furnished from the communications of Dr Gillespie, late physician in Edinburgh, and Dr Coventry professor of agriculture in that university, and partly derived from his own experience.\n\nIn 1803 was published an elegant work on practical Dicksonian agriculture by Dr R. W. Dickson; the second volume of which contains much useful instruction respecting the choice, breeding, feeding, &c., of all the species of live stock employed on a farm; with a few very concise remarks on the diseases of each species. But as these are merely practical hints, they cannot be of much use, except to those who are already tolerably acquainted with the subject.\n\nIn the same year, the Rev. William Daniel performed a task, which, however ill suited to the character and avocation of a clergyman, must be highly grateful to every lover of the sports of the field, in the publication of his Rural Sports, which contains perhaps the most complete account of everything relating to dogs that is to be found in the English language. Among other subjects connected with the management of this favourite companion of man, the reverend author takes occasion to treat pretty fully of his diseases. On this subject, Mr Daniel has not only collected matter from what he conceives to be the best sources, but, what is more useful, as well as more to be depended on, he has added much from his own observation and experience.\n\nOne of the latest works on the diseases of domestic animals, which we have seen, is An Enquiry into the Rot in Sheep, and other animals, by Dr Edward Harrison, a respectable physician of Horn-castle, in Lincolnshire. Of this pamphlet we shall speak at large, when we come to treat of the disease, whose nature and causes it is intended to illustrate.\n\nPART II. ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE HORSE.\n\nIn the sketch which we are to give of the anatomy of the horse, we must very lightly pass over such parts as appear not to be of immediate importance in the practice of farriery, in order to dwell more minutely on those organs that are of greater consequence. Thus we shall content ourselves with giving a tabular view of the bones and muscles; we shall entirely omit the brain and nerves; but we shall describe some of the other viscera, as the stomach, and the bowels, somewhat more minutely.

The mare has usually but 36. They are divided into three kinds; the cutting teeth or nippers; the cuspids or tusks, and the molars or grinders. A knowledge of the horse's teeth and of the changes which they undergo, from their first appearance, is of the greatest consequence, as from it we derive the surest marks of the age of the horse; at least, till he is eight or nine years old.\n\nFigs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, shew the appearance of the teeth from their first cutting to the age of eight years.\n\nFig. 2, shews the appearance of the colt's teeth at the age of three weeks; fig. 3, that of the colt's teeth at three months. Fig. 4, shews the state of the teeth from three months to about four or five years, where a, a, are the pincers or nippers; b, b, what are called the separators; c, c, the corners, or the last of the front teeth at that age; d, d, the tusks. Fig. 5, shews the appearance of the teeth at the age of five years, and figs. 6, 7, and 8, their appearance at the respective ages of six, seven, and eight years.\n\nThe age of a horse is easily known by his mouth, till he comes eight, after which the usual marks wear out.\n\nA horse, like many other brute animals, has his teeth divided into three ranks; viz. his fore-teeth, which are flat and smooth, his tusks, and his back-teeth. His back-teeth or jaw-teeth are called his grinders, being those by which a horse chews and grinds his provender, and are 24 in number, 12 above and 12 below: they are strong double teeth, with sharp edges; but when a horse grows old they wear much smoother.\n\nThe first that grow are his foal-teeth, which begin to appear a few months after he is foaled: they are 12 in number, six above and six below; and are easily distinguished from the teeth that come afterwards by their smallness and whiteness, not unlike the fore-teeth of a man.\n\nWhen the colt is about two years and a half old he casts the four middlemost of his foal-teeth, viz. two above and two below: but some do not cast any of their foal-teeth till they are near three years old. The new teeth are easily distinguished from the foal-teeth, being much stronger, and always twice their size, and are called the incisors or gatherers, being those by which a horse nips off the grass when he is feeding abroad in the fields, or in the house gathers his hay from the rack. When a horse has got these four teeth complete, he is reckoned three years old.\n\nWhen he is about three and a half, or in the spring before he is four years old, he casts out four more of his foal-teeth, viz. two above and two below, one on each side the nippers or middle teeth: so that when you look into a horse's mouth, and see the two middle teeth full grown, and none of the foal-teeth except the common teeth remaining, you may conclude he is four that year about April or May. Some indeed are later colts, but that makes little alteration in the mouth.\n\nThe tusks appear near the same time with the four last mentioned teeth, sometimes sooner than those, and sometimes not till after a horse is full four years old: they are curved like the tusks of other beasts; only in a young horse, they have a sharp edge all round the top and on both sides, the inside being somewhat grooved and flattened, inclined to a hollowness.\n\nWhen a horse's tusks do not appear for some time after the foal-teeth are cast and the new ones come in their room, it is generally owing to the foal-teeth having been pulled out before their time by the breeders or other dealers in horses, to make a colt of three years old appear like one of four, that he may be the more saleable; for when any of the foal-teeth have been pulled out, the others soon come in their places; but the tusks having none that go before them, can never make their appearance till their proper time, viz. when a horse is about four or coming four; and, therefore, one of the surest marks to know a four years old horse is by his tusks, which are then very small and sharp on the top and edges.\n\nWhen a horse comes five, or rather in the spring before he is five, the corner teeth begin to appear, and at first but just equal with the gums, being filled with flesh in the middle. The tusks are also by this time grown to a more distinct size, though not very large; they likewise continue rough and sharp on the top and edges. But the corner teeth are now most to be remarked; they differ from the middle teeth in being more fleshy on the inside, and the gums generally look rawish upon their first shooting out; whereas the others do not appear in this way. The middle teeth arrive at their full growth in less than three weeks; but the corner teeth grow leisurely, and are seldom much above the gums till a horse is full five: they differ also from the other fore-teeth, in this, that they somewhat resemble a shell; and thence are called the shell-teeth, because they environ the flesh in the middle half-way round; and as they grow, the flesh within disappears, leaving a distinct hollowness and openness on the inside. When a horse is full five, these teeth are generally about the thickness of a crown-piece about the gums. From five to five...\nand a half they will grow about a quarter of an inch high, or more; and when a horse is full six, they will be near half an inch, and in some large horses a full half-inch, about the gums.\n\nThe corner teeth in the upper jaw fall out before those in the under, so that the upper corner teeth are seen before those below; on the contrary, the tusks in the under gums come on before those in the upper.\n\nWhen a horse is full six years old, the hollowness on the inside begins visibly to fill up, and that which was at first flehy, grows into a brownish spot, not unlike the eye of a dried garden bean, and continues so till he is seven; with this difference only, that the tooth is more filled up, and the mark or spot becomes faint, and of a lighter colour. At eight, the mark in most horses is quite worn out, though some retain the vestiges of it a long time; and those who have not had a good deal of experience, may sometimes be deceived by taking a horse of nine or ten years old for one of eight. It is at this time only, when a horse is past mark, that one can easily err in knowing the age of a horse; for what practices are used to make a very young horse or colt appear older than he is, by pulling out the foal-teeth before their time, may be discovered by feeling along the edges where the tusks grow, for they may be felt in the gums before the corner teeth are put forth; whereas, if the corner teeth come in some months before the tusks rise in the gums, we may reasonably suspect that the foal-teeth have been pulled out at three years old.\n\nIt will, perhaps, be needless to mention the tricks that are used to make a false mark in a horse's mouth, by hollowing the tooth with a graver, and burning a mark with a small hot iron; because those who are acquainted with the true marks, will easily discover the cheat by the size and colour of the teeth, by the roundness and bluntness of the tusks, by the colour of the false marks, which is generally blacker, and more impressed than the true mark, and by many other visible tokens, which denote the advanced age of a horse.\n\nAfter the horse has passed his eighth year, and sometimes at seven, nothing certain can be known by the mouth. It must, however, be remembered, that some horses have but indifferent mouths when they are young, and soon lose their marks; others have their mouths good for a long time, their teeth being white, even, and regular, till they are 16 years old and upwards, together with many other marks of freshness and vigour; but when a horse comes to be very old, it may be discovered by several indications, the constant attendants of age, viz. his gums wear away insensibly, leaving his teeth long and naked at their roots. The bars of the mouth, which, in a young horse are always flehy, and form so many distinct ridges, are, in an old horse, lean, dry, and smooth, with little or no rising. The eye-pits in a young horse (except those come of old stallions) are generally filled up with flesh, look plump and smooth; whereas in an old horse, they are sunk and hollow, and make them look ghastly, and with a melancholy aspect. There are also other marks which discover a horse to be very old, viz. gray horses turn very white, and many of them all over flea-bitten, except their joints. This, however, happens sometimes later and sometimes sooner, according to the variety of colour and constitution.\n\nBlack horses are apt to grow gray over their eye-brows, and very often over a good part of their face, especially those who have a star or blane fringed round with gray when they are young. All horses, when very old, sink more or less in their backs; and some horses, that are naturally long-backed, grow so hollow with age, that it is scarce possible to fit them with a saddle. Of this kind are several Spanish and Barbary horses, and many Danish and Flanders breed. The joints also grow stiff with old age, and their knees and hocks bend so, that they are apt to trip and stumble upon the least descent, though the way be smooth and nowadays rugged. After which they can be of little use to the owner.\n\n**Chap. II.

III. Of the Stomach and Bowels.\n\nIn the horse there is but one stomach, which is very Structure small in proportion to his general bulk; and is partly of the membranous, partly cuticular, and partly muscular, stomach. It is situated immediately behind the diaphragm, in the left hypochondrium, and in part of the epigastrium, with its excellent orifice extending across the spine to the right, which is the reason that lying on that side is judged more wholesome than sleeping on the left. It has two surfaces, which may be called its sides, though one is posterior, and the other anterior; and two extremities, a large and a small; the superior surface of which receives the gullet, and is called its cardiac orifice; while the former ends in the duodenum, and is termed the pyloric orifice; this extremity, when the stomach is distended, is the most posterior of the two. The hollow part situated superiorly, only forms its lesser curvature, as the lower portion forms its great curvature.\n\nThus when the stomach is moderately distended, it lies in an obliquely transverse direction, with its great extremity a little forwards, and its two orifices superi-\nAnatomy or, but the cardiac the most so, with the lesser extremity rather posterior to the other, and the great curvature inferior. It is evident that the situation of the stomach must vary much with its distension: the foregoing description answers to it when moderately distended only; but where it is very much filled, the left extremity will press upon the diaphragm, and the right will be carried more posteriorly. In oxen and sheep, where the first stomach is large, it is found, when distended, to have its left extremity carried quite into the left iliac region; in which part it is usually punctured, when they are hoved: but such an idea of the stomach of the horse would prove very erroneous; for this animal has a very small one, and therefore its situation can never be such.\n\nFrom a distended stomach pressing upon the diaphragm, we are at no loss to understand, why breathing is impeded after a full meal, when a horse appears to labour for breath; for he is forced to use the intercostal muscles, and the muscles of the shoulder and fore extremities, to open the chest, the posterior enlargement being prevented from the diaphragm being fixed by the pressure of the stomach; hence we see the great impropriety of galloping horses after watering, to warm it in their bellies, as it is foolishly termed. Horses, when grazing, if they drink, are never observed to do this; if it was necessary, nature would dictate to them. How hurtful it is likewise to ride hard, after a horse has been full fed, is equally evinced. The stomach has externally a covering from the peritoneum, which adheres closely to it, by means of its cellular portion; and which portion is dipping in between the muscular fibres. Its middle portion is made up of muscular fibres, which are more numerous in this animal, than in the ruminant; making this kind of stomach a medium between the membranous one of some animals, and the true muscular stomach of others. The direction of these fibres is various; but they may principally be referred to a longitudinal and a transverse order, though neither of them are regularly so, and are intermixed with others, whose direction is very oblique, and interlaced with each other. The longitudinal plane is the most external of the two, and appears a continuation of the external plane of the oesophagus, with some original fibres, which spread over the lesser curvature, being carried obliquely round, and likewise over the great extremity, forming themselves into a kind of vertex, whose centre is in the middle of that extremity. The inner plane is by much the larger, and is not quite circular, but slightly oblique, crossing the obliquity of the longitudinal plane. This circular plane is very thick and strong round the cardia, or that extremity into which the oesophagus terminates. They are here so very thick as to form a true sphincter; and to this it is in some measure owing, that a horse cannot vomit; for when the circular and longitudinal fibres are acting from the pylorus to the cardia, by any irritation that reverses the usual motion, producing an effort to vomit, the circular and longitudinal fibres of the cardia being infinitely stronger and more numerous, are contracting this orifice (especially the circular), as the others are contracting the other parts; for as the muscular fibres exist equally throughout the stomach, by which the motions are effected, it cannot be simply from the existence of the circular covering to the first portion of his stomach, that he cannot vomit; for it is reasonable to suppose the fibres act throughout the stomach by the common consent of parts; nor do they of actual necessity want an immediate stimulus to their surfaces; for were this the case, the fibres of the oesophagus would not by the presence of the masticated bolus be stimulated to contract through the cuticular coat, which equally here lies over the fibres; nevertheless, the cuticular coat of the stomach is probably afflicting in this difficulty to regurgitate: it does it by lessening the liability to nausea, which seldom takes place in the horse; and as vomiting is only an effort to remove nausea or its cause, so nature not having given the disease, has not provided the means for its removal. As likewise vomiting appears to be a reverting of the peristaltic motion of the stomach; which motion, in its natural state, begins from the cardia, and ends at the pylorus; so in this reversed state, it commences at the pylorus, and ends at the cardia, thus regurgitating its contents; so it is very probable that the cuticular covering may lessen this inverted peristaltic motion in the upper portion, though it cannot wholly destroy it; and hence cannot be the only, or the principal reason of the impossibility, or rather of the difficulty with which this animal vomits; for instances have occurred where it has taken place. A horse in Suffolk was seen to regurgitate a large quantity of grains, and we have heard of one or two other instances; but these must be regarded as very rare occurrences.\n\nIt is not, therefore, that the stomach of the horse cannot be irritated to make an attempt to vomit, that no such effect generally takes place; for though it is but very seldom that nausea occurs, and perhaps never in a state of nature, yet it may be excited by means of aconite, heliobore, and some other substances, which have caused fruitless efforts to vomit. But the true and principal reason that a horse may be said, naturally not to be able to vomit, arises, in that nature has wisely constructed the parts, that the very effort to it increases the resistance by the very strong sphincter placed at the mouth of the cardia. Had this resistance not been placed, and every means taken to increase the almost impossibility of vomiting in a horse, it is evident that from the curtain of the palate stopping the opening of the mouth, this action, had it taken place, would have occasioned suffocation. The inner coat of the stomach is composed of two portions, the one cuticular and the other villous. This species of cuticular covering to nearly one half of the stomach, is peculiar to such animals as appear destined to live on grain, as horses, asses, rats, and mice; and this forms a third species of stomach between the true membranous one of graminivorous animals, and the muscular of the carnivorous tribes, and it may be considered in a slight degree, as a species of gizzard, resembling the structure of those animals, as fowls, who have organs to make up for the want of teeth. For a horse has not the means of re-mastication, as in oxen or sheep, nor does he usually masticate his food at first sufficiently to comminute it; for the wants of the constitution stimulate him to a hasty deglutition of his food, which, if there was not some other structure than that common to stomachs in general, would not be sufficiently digested: for the food is solid, and the stomach small; therefore this cuticular coat may be useful, as its inflexibility allows it to press\nin a small degree upon the food, and perform a slight trituration upon it. This cuticular coat is spread over the first portion of the stomach, taking in all the great extremity, and forming between a third and half of its extent. It is formed into folds at the cardia in the same manner as at the internal part of the oesophagus; but as soon as it has passed this orifice, these folds take an irregular direction, but are less than those formed on the villous surface.\n\nThe villous or fimbriated portion of the stomach, though it occupies more of the length of the stomach, yet perhaps in real extent is little more than half of its surface. It unites with or is connected to the cuticular. Its external surface is firm, and appears as it were a distinct portion, but is only dense cellular substance, which has given rise to the description of four tunics to the stomach. The tunica villosa is so called from its resemblance to the pile of velvet; its fine villi are probably the extreme fine ends of vellus secreting the gastric juice. The villous coat being much larger in extent than the muscular, is thrown into folds, which are more considerable than those of the cuticular coat. These are largest at the portion toward the great extremity, and are irregularly waving: towards the duodenum they become less, and when at the pylorus they form a fold that makes a kind of valve to this part of the stomach, preventing the return of the food, and its too speedy passage out. The folds not only hinder the too speedy passage of the food, but by this means apply the gastric juice more certainly to all the parts; but the principal end is to increase the secreting surface, which is here more extensive than those of the human.\n\nThe remainder of the alimentary canal is continued from the lower orifice of the stomach, to the anus, or end of the passage, forming a long canal of different dimensions, called intestines. They are usually divided into small and large. In some animals they hardly merit this distinction, there being but little difference in point of size; but in the horse, the proportion is very different; the small intestines being not much larger than the human, but the large of an immense bulk. This canal is connected through its whole extent to membranous productions of the peritoneum, especially to those called mesentery and mesocolon. The whole canal varies in point of length in different subjects; but is seldom less than 24 yards, and often more. The intestines are contained within a prolongation of the peritoneum, which arises in most instances from the mesentery: the two folds of this membrane separate and surround the intestines, forming their external coat. The next coat is muscular, and formed of two layers of fibres, a longitudinal and a circular; the latter are in greater proportion, and by the contraction of these the vermiform motion, called peristaltic, is performed, from the longitudinal fibres slightly shortening them, and the circular diminishing their size. Within this muscular coat there is a quantity of cellular membrane rather more dense than in some other parts; and this used to be regarded as a coat, and was called the nervous, but is only a layer of cellular membrane. The third and inner coat of the intestines is the villous, which is very vascular and fimbriated. There are no considerable folds of the inner tunic of the intestines, as in the human. In this animal these are rendered unnecessary by the great length of his intestines, and the slow passage of the alimentary contents through them by this length and his position.\n\nThe first portion of the bowels, which answers to the duodenum in man, though in the horse it is nearer 20 inches than 12, is attached to the stomach, having its first pyloric orifice ending in it; its course in the horse is rather different from that in the human, and by this it acquires a more complete covering from the peritoneum. It hangs loose and pendulous, being attached to the concave surface of the liver, where making a turn, it is fixed to the vertebrae; it then takes the name of jejunum. It appears rather larger in circumference than the other small intestines, and is remarkable for having the pancreatic and biliary ducts penetrating it, sometimes entering it obliquely close together, and sometimes at a distance from each other.\n\nThe jejunum and ileum differ very little from the same bowels in the human species.\n\nThe great intestines are very properly so called in the horse; and as they have very little resemblance to the human large intestines, they require a particular description.\n\nThe c\u00e6cum is situated in the back part of the belly, and is a very large canal, which is entered abruptly by the ilium. The fore part of this canal projects forward two or three feet, into a sort of bag of the same size of the colon; but the back part terminates in what is called a blind end. The c\u00e6cum usually occupies the right side of the belly, and appears immediately on opening the peritoneum, with its commencement from the colon and ilium in the right iliac region, extending forwards to the right side, with its blind end close to the diaphragm and liver. This termination is not furnished, as in some animals, with an appendix vermiformis, but terminates by a simple blind end. Through the peritoneal covering are seen four muscular longitudinal bands, extending from the extremity along the muscular coat, and dividing the gut into four longitudinal portions. One or two of these are usually covered with fat, and are not so regularly longitudinal as the others. The internal membrane is folded up between the longitudinal bands, and by intersecting them forms numerous cavities called the cells.\n\nOn the slightest inspection we see a great peculiarity in the form of the c\u00e6cum of the horse; and in a more accurate view, are struck with the importance of the structure to this animal, and are led to consider the c\u00e6cum as little less than a second stomach. This is in fact the case; for the food coming in a macerated mass from the small intestines, is mixed in the c\u00e6cum, with the bile, and pancreatic juice, and here undergoes a farther change, to which the structure of the c\u00e6cum is evidently favourable, as it is fitted to retain the mass for a considerable time within it, and to circulate it through all its parts. It has two blind ends, one forming its basis, and near this enters the ilium; the other forming its point, and extending up towards the diaphragm. From one part of the base the colon commences by a very contracted portion, for the purpose of preventing the entrance of the contents of the ilium, till they have passed through the c\u00e6cum. In many animals the c\u00e6cum is a very inconsiderable part; in some it has one or more appendices; in others it is almost entirely wanting; and\nAnatomy and in all but the horse its use is obscure, and apparently not very important; but in the horse it is certainly little less than a second stomach, for its whole structure proves, that it is purposely designed that all the food taken in shall be poured into the base of this gut, by the contraction of which it shall be forced towards the apex, and either in its passage or return shall be detained in the cells to be in some way farther acted upon, and to undergo some change necessary to the system. Having undergone this change, whatever it is, it is forced into the colon.\n\nThe colon commences small from the side of the base of the c\u00e6cum; and as the ilium cannot be said to enter it together with the c\u00e6cum, as in some animals, there is in the horse no such part as the valve of the colon properly so called. The ilium has, however, a sort of protrusion with its inner membrane, by which in some measure it prevents the return of the contents of the c\u00e6cum. As the colon passes, it is farther contracted, and then enlarges into a very long and large canal, which, after having made nearly the whole circumference of the belly, is again slightly contracted. It then again enlarges, passes again round the belly, and is a third time contracted, just where it ends in the rectum or straight gut. The small intestines rest on the turns of the colon and on the c\u00e6cum. The colon is furnished with four ligamentous bands in its large portion, but there are only two in the small portions; these form longitudinal frenae, which are interlocked again by internal folds, so as to form the cells of the colon. It is connected and supported in its situation by that portion of the mesentery termed mesocolon. This intestine is very different in the horse to what it is in most other animals, in consequence of its variations in size, being in most other instances of one general size; it is likewise this gut and the c\u00e6cum that are the principal seat of the inflammation arising from violent purging medicines.\n\nThe rectum is the continuation of the colon, and passes backwards from the lumbar vertebrae to the anus. Its muscular coat is thicker than that of the other intestines, and it is thrown internally into cavities by the inner membrane, in some manner similar to the cells of the colon, though less; were it not for this, the intestine might be too constantly stimulated to expel its contents, but by this means the faeces are received and retained till they are collected in a considerable quantity, when they are expelled. The rectum is attached to the spine and sacrum by the peritoneum, is here called mecorectum; but the true fold of peritoneum does not invest its whole portion, but leaves it as it approaches the rectum, which is at this place only covered with the cellular part of it. The mesentery bands of the rectum are very strong, and terminate at the anus in a kind of ligamentary expansion attached to the os coccygis.\n\nThe anus is the termination of the rectum, and is opened by the force of the peristaltic motion and the consent of the parts, and shut by a muscular band round the extremity of the gut called the sphincter. It is likewise elevated and retracted by two pair of muscles.\n\n**Chap. IV. Of the Foot.**\n\nIn our account of the anatomy of the horse's foot, it will be necessary to describe only one foot, as those belonging to both extremities are similar in structure.\n\nThe bones which compose the foot of the horse are fixed in number, considering the foot as commencing at the fetlock joint. Of these six bones two are included within the hoof, viz. the coffin-bone, and the navicular-bone; and four are situated above the hoof, viz. the large pattern-bone, the small pattern-bone, and the two sesamoid bones.\n\nWe shall begin from above, with the large pattern-bone, as this contributes to form what is called the large pattern joint.\n\nThe large pattern-bone, (1, fig. 13, 14, and 15,) is large part of an oblong cylindrical form, and, as is the case with tern bone, all such bones, is smaller in the middle than at either extremity. It articulates above with the lower head of the cannon-bone, and below with the upper head of the small pattern-bone. At its upper extremity there are three depressions, one on each side, large and superficial (a, c, fig. 13,) to receive the outer and inner convexity of the lower head of the cannon-bone, and one in the middle, b, for receiving the middle narrow convexity of the same bone. The fore part of this bone is slightly rounded, and rough towards its upper extremity, as at d, for the firmer attachment of ligaments. Behind, at its back part, it is flatter; and here there is a rough depression (C, fig. 14,) also for the attachment of a ligament that is deep seated, and is fixed to the two sesamoid bones. At the lower extremity the large pattern-bone is convex on each side (D, E, fig. 14,) for entering into two concavities of the small pattern-bone; and there is a depression (f, fig. 13,) for the attachment of a tendon. At the lower extremity there is also a roughness on each side at e, for the insertion of ligaments. Both extremities are covered with very smooth elastic gristle, which is kept constantly moist by the synovia or joint oil.\n\nAt the upper end of the large pattern-bone, towards the back part, are placed the two sesamoid bones, AA (fig. 14). These are of an irregular wedge-like form, and are covered with cartilage, articulating both with the cannon-bone, and on the back part they are very smooth to admit of a tendon readily sliding over them. The upper edges of these bones on each side have a rough irregular surface, into which is inserted a strong ligament that comes from the upper and back parts of the cannon-bone, is fastened separately to each of the sesamoid bones, from which it proceeds downwards and obliquely forward to be inserted into the tendon of the large extensor muscles, (see a a a, fig. 16,) a little below the large pattern-joint. These sesamoid bones are of considerable use in the mechanism of the large pattern-joint. \"In consequence of their forming the back part of the large pattern-joint, and articulating with the lower and posterior part of the cannon, they contribute very essentially, by always receding whenever the foot comes in contact with the ground, to act as a spring to the animal, and to prevent concussion. All the weight received by the upper head of the large pattern-bone is conveyed to bones below; but a considerable portion of the burden is received by the sesamoid bones. While the animal is at rest, and also during motion, these bones sustain part of the weight; and where the pattern bones are long and oblique, the sesamoids often receive so much of the weight as to put the ligaments violently on the stretch, and occasion lameness.\"\nThe small pattern-bone (2, fig. 13; 14, 15) is about half the length of the large one, and is as broad as it is long. Besides the two concave depressions, (h, h, fig. 13,) mentioned before, there is a ridge between them, t, that enters a corresponding depression, g, in the lower head of the large pattern-bone. The small pattern-bone has at the back and upper part (F, fig. 14,) a small projection, for the insertion of a long ligament, that comes from the fetamoid bones. The lower articulating surface is more extensive than the upper, as it is connected with the upper surface of two considerable bones, viz. the navicular and coffin-bone. It is of great consequence to understand the mechanism of the joints that are formed by this connection, as it is on this part that the principal stirs of the animal falls. The union of the small pattern-bone with the navicular and coffin-bones, forming what is called the coffin-joint, is one of the principal methods provided by nature to prevent concussion.\n\nThe navicular-bone (3, fig. 13, 14, 15,) is connected above with the back part of the small pattern-bone, and the lower edge of this bone is attached by a large ligament to the back part of the coffin-bone. The navicular-bone is slightly concave, to receive the back part of the lower head of the small pattern-bone. The upper edge of the navicular-bone behind is rough (g, fig. 14,) and thick, for the attachment of the upper ligament; and the lower edge of the navicular-bone receives at the back part a strong flat ligament from the coffin-bone, immediately above the insertion of the flexor-tendon. The lower surface of the navicular-bone is covered by cartilage, and has a small ridge in its centre, (t, fig. 13,) to be received into a corresponding depression in the long flexor-tendon. This bone may be considered as forming two distinct joints, one of which is composed by the connection of one part of the bone with the tendon of the flexor-muscle, and the other is formed by the connection of another surface of the navicular-bone.\n\nThe whole weight of the animal, supported by the small pattern-bone, is thrown upon the coffin and navicular bones. Of this weight the coffin-bone receives the greater share; but the navicular-bone receives a considerable portion of it, though this bone does not contribute to prevent concussion to much as Mr Freeman has endeavoured to prove. The navicular-bone, when the hoof touches the ground, defends a little, and thus prevents that concussion which the horse's body would have received if this bone had been immovably fixed; and when the hoof is again raised from the ground, the elasticity of the parts below the navicular bone lifts up this bone into its former position, thus acting as a spring in facilitating the motion of the animal. As the weight supported by the navicular-bones of the hind feet is less than that supported by the same bone of the fore feet, their descent in the former is less than in the latter. The organs connected with the navicular-bones of the hind feet are also less subject to disease.\n\nThe coffin-bone (4, fig. 13, 14, 15,) is so named from its being concealed, or as it were buried within the hoof. It is also sometimes called the foot-bone. On its fore part it is rounded, having very nearly the shape of the external hoof. Its upper surface is slightly hollowed (m, m, fig. 13,) to receive the lower end of the small pattern-bone, with the fore part of which it articulates, as it does behind with the fore edge of the navicular-bone. At the back part the coffin-bone ends in two processes on each side, the upper of which are tipped with cartilage. At the upper part of the front of the coffin-bone there is a small protuberance, (w, fig. 13,) extending upwards above the joint, and serving for the insertion of the tendon of the muscles that extend the foot. Below this the coffin-bone is extremely porous, for the passage of nerves and blood-vessels; and towards the lower part in particular there are about 13 holes, for the transmission of considerable arteries, which go to supply the sensitive sole. At the heels and quarters the coffin-bone is still more porous, and is supplied with a greater number of arteries, but these are proportionally smaller. The lower surface of the heels of this bone is also very porous, where it unites with the sensitive sole, but the rest of lower surface is generally smooth. There are here two hollow surfaces, which receive two corresponding rounded parts of the sensitive sole. They are unequal, the foremost being the larger. Into the hollow on the back part, the tendon of the flexor-muscle is inserted. (A, fig. 16.)\n\nThere are seven ligaments belonging to the coffin joint, of which there are three pairs, and one single. The first pair of ligaments take their origin from the heels of the coffin-bone on each side, and pass obliquely upwards as high as the middle, to which they are attached, and at which part of the small pattern-bone (B, fig. 16,) they are blended with the fibres of the lateral ligaments of the small pattern-joint. The second pair of ligaments on each side arise from the edge of the coffin-bone, near the heels, and pass obliquely forward to be inserted into the middle of the small pattern-bone (C, fig. 16,) near the attachment of the extensor-tendon. The third pair take their origin from the lateral edges of the anterior process of the coffin-bone, and are inserted into the edges of the cartilages. The use of these ligaments is to unite the cartilages more firmly to the coffin-bone. The extensor-tendon being inserted into the upper edge of the anterior process of the coffin-bone, prevents the necessity of a ligament at this part. The single ligament of the coffin-bone is connected with the posterior and inferior concave surface of the coffin-bone, immediately above the insertion of the flexor-tendon, and also with the lower edge of the navicular bone. Besides this ligament there is another attached to the whole of the upper and back part of the navicular-bone, by which means that bone is enabled to support a greater share of the weight that rests upon it. By means of these ligaments this important joint is rendered very strong, while by the elasticity of the cartilages, and the constant supply of lubricating fluid within the joint, all the motions of the animal are rendered safe and easy.","sp":31,"ep":48},{"h":"FARRIERY","t":"Operations, by some to apply the hot iron, so as to burn away the hair, for some time previously to firing the skin; as much time is otherwise lost before the proper impression can be made by the iron. After firing a blister is sometimes applied, as this is thought to increase the good effect produced by the iron. When firing is employed on the hind legs, or on any part where the operator would be exposed to danger from the horse's kicking, it is necessary to confine the legs by means of fetters.\n\n3d. This operation has been found useful in spaying, ring-bones, old callous swellings of the back flanks; and in wind-galls. For this purpose the irons are used as already directed. It is the custom with some farriers to apply a blister in these cases before firing, in order to reduce the swelling; as they suppose that firing employed without this precaution would tend to fix the swelling, and render it incurable. There is probably little foundation for such an idea.\n\n4th. Firing is very frequently had recourse to by way of a flytrick in stopping or checking profuse bleedings, from accidental wounds, or surgical operations. The iron employed with this view has generally a rounded extremity, except in the operation of docking, where an iron in the form of a ring is generally employed.\n\n5th. Another use of firing is in wounds of the joints, or other circumscribed cavities, where it is employed to promote a kindly circulation, and consequent granulation of healthy flesh. It has been employed in these cases by Mr Coleman, with considerable success.\n\n6th. Firing has been found one of the most effectual remedies in those superficial ulcers that accompany farcy or glanders in the horse; and,\n\nLastly, The use of the hot iron has been found the only certain means of preventing the dreadful effects arising from the bite of a mad animal, when properly applied after cutting out the bitten part.\n\nCHAP. VI. Of Docking.\n\nThe honour of having introduced this most useful and humane practice, belongs, we believe, solely to this country. It appears that it was in use in England, so long ago as the end of the eighth century; for at a council held there, about that time (concilium Calcute-tenis, or council of Calchute), there was a canon enacted, expressly forbidding this practice, as indecent and abominable.\n\nIt does not appear that this operation is performed among the Arabians, or other eastern nations; or at least, if it be, it is not intended as an ornament to the animal, but either from necessity, when the tail is disfigured, or by way of mark, to distinguish some particular horse.\n\nDocking has been practised in Germany for about 300 years; and probably much longer in France. It was certainly unknown to the Italians at the latter end of the fifteenth century; for we are told, that when the army of the emperor Maximilian was in Italy in 1497, the Italians were much surprised to see his cavalry mounted on docked horses.\n\nIt is strange that prejudice and false taste should lead mankind to deprive their horses of a part, which, to the eye of reason and unsophisticated nature, must appear not only an ornament to the animal, but as designed by the Creator as a protection against flies, gnats, and innumerable other winged enemies, which harass them in the summer months. It is true indeed, that in Britain, where the summer heats are in general not so lasting, or so violent, as in the more southern countries of Europe, these insects are not always so troublesome as they are found in those climates. But even here they are sufficiently so, to render the protection of the tail necessary; and when our cavalry are unhappily sent to the continent, the loss of the horses' tails proves a very serious obstacle to the success of the troops. More than one instance of this has occurred. At the battle of Dettingen in 1743, great part of the British cavalry were absolutely dismounted, from the death of the horses, occasioned in a great measure by the torment which they experienced from the bite of gad-flies, and other insects; and at the battle of Minden, in the seven years war, the cavalry of the allies were thrown into so much disorder by these petty enemies, that they had nearly lost the battle. Lord Pembroke declares, that he has seen the cavalry horses belonging to our army, fireeating, rushing against each other, refusing their food, and absolutely devoured by flies, for want of their tails to brush them off; while those of the horses of the foreign cavalry that had not been deprived of this necessary defence, were cool, tranquil, fed well, and were in good condition. From the inconveniences which our cavalry have suffered from the want of the horses' tails, it has been for some years the custom to employ long-tailed horses.\n\nThe principal reasons that have been assigned for this absurd practice, are, that a long tail is extremely inconvenient to both horse and rider, when travelling through dirty roads and bully forests; and that when the tail is of its ordinary length, the animal cannot carry it in that fine, arched, cocked-tail direction, which seems to form one of the chief beauties of the modern racer.\n\nWe apprehend that few horses enjoy such an ample length of tail as that of the redoubted Hudibras; of whose horse we read that,\n\n\"His draggling tail hung in the dirt,\nWhich on his rider he would flirt,\nStill as his tender side he pricked\nWith arm'd heel, or with unarm'd kickt.\"\n\nAs to the beauty of a cocked-tailed horse, we profess ourselves not competent to judge; but with due deference to the gentlemen of the turf, and the respectable fraternity of jockeys, we should humbly conceive (we speak with submission) that a horse with a long tail is a much finer object than one that is perpetually perking and wriggling his tail in the air, and exposing his bare breech to the broad glare of open day.\n\nDocking is usually performed on horses, by laying the Mode of tail upon a block, and chopping off the part by means performing of a cleaver or hatchet struck with a mallet. Perhaps the operation would be rather less bungling to perform the operation by means of a knife, and it would not take up much more time. When this is done, the hair must be previously clipped away, that the knife may cut more easily; and previous to making the incision, the skin should be drawn up forcibly towards the rump. The incision may be made by beginning on one side, and cutting round from below upwards, so as to perform the whole.\nOperations, whole as nearly as possible at one stroke. When the skin and muscles have been completed divided, the part of the tail is to be cut off at the joining of two of the bones as nearly as possible to the edges of the wound, still keeping the skin drawn up. When the part has been removed, the flesh is to be feared all round with a hot iron, to stop the effusion of blood. The iron employed in France for this purpose is formed like a ring, so that it is easily applied to the flesh without injuring the bone. The wound must be covered from the air, and the animal must live rather low to prevent inflammation.\n\nThe practice of nicking, or cutting across the muscles that draw down the tail, so that those which pull it upwards may exert their full power, is still more inhuman and absurd than that of docking; and as we will contribute nothing towards extending this abominable practice, we shall omit the operation altogether.\n\n**Chap. VII. Of Cropping.**\n\nTaste and fashion have introduced another operation, by which the ears of horses and dogs are changed from their natural shape and size, to those which are considered by their owners as more handsome or agreeable. The ears of the horse and the dog are seldom of such a shape or size, as to render them inconvenient to the animals, or to unfit them for the purposes for which nature has designed them. This may, however, sometimes happen; and there are some cases of wounds or diseases that may render cropping necessary; but in performing this operation, it should always be kept in mind, that no part of the animal is made in vain, no more of the ears should be taken away than what is absolutely necessary. We not unfrequently see horses and dogs cropped close to their head, a practice which is cruel and absurd, and which is always followed by more or less deafness, and exposes the animals to much inconvenience from the weather. In those dogs that are employed in rabbit warrens, or for similar purposes, where they are required to enter burrows, cropping is attended with the worst effects, as the ears of the dog are unavoidably exposed to the particles of sand and earth that he breathes away in his passage through the burrow.\n\nThe operation of cropping scarcely requires description. In the dog it is usually performed by means of a pair of scissors, but these should be very sharp. In the horse, more nicety is required; and a particular instrument, called the cropping iron, is required, and a shape of the size of which it is intended the ear shall be, is applied to the ear, to mark the line of section. After the ear is cut, the skin and muscles recede considerably from the grizzly part; but this seems of little consequence, and the wound heals in a few days without any other attention, than confining the animal within doors, and keeping him on a moderate, cooling diet. Horses' ears are sometimes trimmed, as the grooms call it; that is, they are deprived of the fine soft hair that lines the inside of the cavity. This practice is equally absurd with cropping, as will appear from the following observations of Mr. Clark.\n\n\"The ears of horses, as of other animals, (says Mr. Clarke), are covered on the inside with a short down, intermixed with long hairs, which line the external cavity of the ear, which seems designed by nature to prevent harsh sounds from making too great an impression upon the brain, and likewise to prevent the cold air, rain, dust, flies, &c. from annoying the internal ear. The means commonly used to remove this down, &c. is by the scissors, the flame of a candle, or that of a burning torch. Both the latter are cruel and barbarous, and cause a deal of pain to the animal, not only from the blisters that sometimes rise on the ears after this manner of fingering them, but likewise from the means that are used to make horses stand with patience to undergo the operation, that is a twitch on the nose, and perhaps, if he is troublesome to the operator, one put on the ear. It is to be observed, that horses are very much guided, or directed by the sense of hearing. This is obvious in those that hear distinctly, from the motion of their ears, and the direction they give them to whatever quarter any sound comes from, the attention they pay to what passes around them, or to what is spoke to them. Many of them, particularly the finest kind, as they only are liable to this kind of treatment, have the sense of hearing considerably blunted, if not rendered quite deaf from the above operation.\n\nAs this operation is generally first performed on young horses at the time they are breaking, it is the more hurtful; as the uncommon sounds, as the rattling of carriages, drums, &c., which are entirely new to them, and to which they are then more exposed on the roads or in streets, must make the greater impression on the sense of hearing; and perhaps it may be owing to the above cause only, that many horses are timorous to pass carriages, and remain so ever afterwards.\n\nAnother disadvantage which attends this operation upon the ears of horses, is, that they will not go on cheerfully when travelling in opposition to the wind, more especially if it rains; for as the wind and rain get free access into the ears, they are continually flapping their heads and endeavouring to turn from it; and those who are of a more impatient temper, will wheel suddenly round, in order to avoid what gives them so much uneasiness. They are then said to be reticent; the whip and spurs are applied by way of chastisement for a supposed fault only.\n\nFrom what has been said, it will be obvious, from the practice of taking away the natural covering from the inside of the ears, that the internal ear must be exposed to be considerably injured, particularly from cold, dust, &c., which blunts the sense of hearing, and perhaps causes deafness; for it is observed in those horses who have been much used to this treatment, that they lose that lively, active motion of the ears, and appear dull and inattentive to what passes around them, and even to the voice of their keeper.\"\n\n**Chap. VIII. Of Castration.**\n\nIt is found of use to deprive the males of several of the domestic animals, especially of horses and cattle, of the means of propagation, either to render them more mild and tractable, or, in the case of cattle, to promote their fattening, and render their flesh less rank. It has been disputed whether the castration of the stallion is productive of such advantages as are not counterbalanced by the loss of strength and spirit, which the animals sustain.\nPart III.\n\nFAR R I E R Y.\n\nOperations sustain by the operation. It is not our intention to dis-\ncuss this point, and we shall here only describe the usual modes of performing the operation.\n\nThe most prudent mode of castrating an adult or grown horse, appears to be the following. Let him be thrown on some convenient spot, on the off side, and when down, let the off hind leg be drawn towards the neck, by which the scrotum will be fairly exposed.\n\nHolding the scrotum firmly, make a cut at once through it, not of too great length, but sufficient to admit the teat being pressed out; this being done, apply the clamps or a pair of nippers on the cord within an inch of the teat, and hold the clamps sufficiently tight to stop the flow of blood, but not to bruise the cord; the stone may then be cut off with a scalpel, or it may be seared off with a burning knife. If it is cut off with a scalpel immediately before the clams let go their hold, fear the end of the cord. Some apply a little powdered resin on it before searing, after which the clams may be loosened. When this is finished, proceed to remove the other in the same manner.\n\nAfter both are removed, a pledget of lint, wetted in warmed spirits, may be introduced just within the edges of each wound; but no salt should by any means be introduced, as is the practice of some farriers; nor will any kind of bandage be easily retained, and if anything of this kind is used, it should be very loosely applied, so as not to irritate.\n\nWhen this operation is performed on a full grown horse, if he is at all fat, he should be previously bled, and kept rather low; and it will be prudent to choose mild weather for the operation; and the place likewise he is put into after the operation, should be of a moderate temperature.\n\nSometimes there is a considerable degree of inflammation, and when this happens, it is by no means proper to trot the horse about as is commonly done, but to bleed and purge, and apply a solution of sugar of lead to the parts. It will also be of advantage to insert a feton smeared with blistering ointment into the inside of the thigh.\n\nSome operators separate the epididymis from the teat, and suffer it to remain, by which means they think that a portion of the animal's spirit is retained. A similar custom is said to prevail in France; but the French operators object to it, on the idea that it produces fulvous fores in the part. The fact is, that when any portion of the teat is suffered to remain, though it cannot secrete semen, yet it has some action going on within, by which it produces some influence both on the mind and form; and as such, the future growth of the animal may perhaps be slightly affected by it, and perhaps his temper too, but the addition to the latter may probably not be a very favourable one.\n\nWhere the operation is to be performed, the best time is probably when the foal is about three months old, though some prefer a much more advanced age, as six, or even twelve months, and more in some cases. In all animals there is, however, the least danger of inflammation while they are young in performing such operations. Besides it is better to cut colts before they have any propensity to hanker after mares, and get bad habits. When the foals are early, and the weather is not too hot, the latter end of May or beginning of June may be a good and proper season.\n\nVol. VIII. Part II.\n\nSome of the Yorkshire breeders, however, think that Operations, they find advantage in deferring the operation till the horses are two years old, as they suppose they become the stronger and handlomer for it. And where the operation is performed at one year old, they find that the foals have not recovered the check they sustained by weaning before they experience another in this operation. They experience no greater difference in their recovery at two years old than one. The foals should be kept up some time before the gelding is to be performed.\n\nThe castrating of male lambs is performed at different periods in different districts; but it seems the most proper to be done in the first fortnight in the stronger sort of lambs, and in those of the weaker kind from a fortnight to three weeks, or a month old, according to circumstances. Some, however, advise its being done at a much later period. When done early, there is, however, the least danger of too much inflammation coming on, if the lambs be in a healthy condition. When performed while very young, on tender, delicate lambs, mortification may sometimes be apt to come on and destroy them.\n\nCHAP. IX. Of Spaying.\n\nSpaying is an operation performed on the females, Spaying, chiefly on cattle and dogs, to prevent their producing young. It consists in taking away the ovaries, or those appendages to the womb in which are formed the rudiments of the young. It is supposed that it is attended with considerable advantage, in cows or heifers, as it greatly promotes their fattening. In bitches, it is generally employed to prevent the unpleasant circumstances that often occur in the time they are in heat.\n\nSpaying is usually performed after the animal has been newly impregnated, as at that time the ovaries are larger than before impregnation, and are of course more easily discovered. In performing the operation, a cut is made through the integuments of the belly, between the haunch-bone and the last ribs, and through this opening the fingers are to be introduced. If the animal has not been impregnated, a roundish hard substance will be felt attached to the loins. This is to be drawn out and cut off, and that on the other side is now to be felt for, drawn out, and cut away. The ovaries, as has been said, will be much more readily found, especially the inmost one, when the animal is impregnated, as the young within the horns of the womb afford a good direction to the finger. It is sometimes necessary, when the animal is not in a state of impregnation, to make an opening on each side of the belly, one for the extraction of each ovary; but when this is found requisite, it will be better to delay the second operation till the animal is in some measure recovered from the first. When the ovaries have been cut away, the openings must be closed by means of a stitch through the integuments of the belly, and must be carefully covered with sticking plaster, to prevent the admission of the external air.\n\nMr Daniel remarks, that this operation does not always succeed in bitches, unless done by a skilful person, who can be relied upon. If it be ill done, although the bitches can have no puppies, they will notwithstanding go to heat, which defeats the purpose. There is a difference of opinion, whether a bitch should be spayed.\n\nOperations. Spayed before or after she has had a litter of whelps; Mr Daniel, however, has tried, and found both periods to answer. The best time is 14 or 15 days after she has taken the dog, and when the puppies just begin to be knotted within her. All the roots of the veins should not be taken away; her strength and swiftness will be injured by so doing. They should be kept low for several days before the operation is performed, and fed on thin meat for some time after.\n\n*Daniel's Rural Sports.*\n\nChap. X. Of Delivery in Difficult Labours.\n\nIn general, Nature is all-sufficient for bringing forth the young of domestic animals, and man has little to do, except to take care that the females be not in such a situation as may expose themselves or their young to injury. It is proper always to watch a mare, or a cow, that is near the time of bringing forth; and to be at hand, to afford affluence where necessary. Mares do not often require assistance, as with them, difficult labour is uncommon. Where this does occur, the directions we are about to give for the cow, will in general answer for the mare.\n\nCows, particularly the short-horned species, often need the affluence of the accoucheur. The natural presentation of the calf, is with its head and fore-feet, the nose between the feet, and the back upwards. Downing enumerates seven preternatural positions: namely, 1st, Reverse presentation, or tail first. 2nd, Fore-feet, no head appearing. 3rd, Side-belly upwards, head reversed over one shoulder, legs appearing. 4th, Fore-feet, with head under the brisket. 5th, Head alone, or one fore-leg only with it. 6th, Head and one leg, or head alone. 7th, Calf lying on its back, its four legs folded nearly together, and close up to the cow's back; the head appearing, or doubled back, even with the ribs, on one side or other; one hind-leg, perhaps, appearing.\n\nThe following general rules are given by Mr Lawrence.\u2014Timely affluence before the cow is exhausted. Extraction never to be attempted in an improper position. Supply the hand and arm with warm water and fresh lard. Examination best made, the cow standing, and in the interval of pains. In pulling at the feet, inclose the claws in the hand, that the horn may not bruise the cow. Navel string bursting, and the usual flux of blood, of no consequence. Instruments to be used only in the last resort, and by experienced and steady persons only. The proper hook is of hard iron, four inches long, with a loop for the cord at the straight end.\n\nIn a natural position, if the cow should want help, the position of the calf may be ascertained after the waters have been seen. A cord ought to be in readiness, to attach to the fore legs of the calf, in order to assist each natural exertion. The head to be kept clear of obstruction.\n\nPreternatural position. No 1. as above. No attempt to turn the calf (this position being favourable for extraction), but use expedition, for fear it be suffocated. Press the haunches back with the palm of the hand, take hold of the bend of the hough of one leg, pull at it, and reach the foot; both feet may thus be brought forth. No 2. Reduce the head to its proper situation, between the fore-legs, either by hold of the nose, or the face-bone. A long arm is needful, which must be kept Operations. to the full extent in the body, that infant advantage may be taken of every throe, the fingers being properly fixed. No 3. Gently move the calf back, and bring the head forth to the legs. No 4. Push the calf back to find the head; pull at the nose; this requires adroits, but it is useless to employ force, until the head be in its proper place. No 5 and 6. Push the calf back against the shoulders and brisket; the feet will be found folded under the belly; bring the feet forward, one at a time, the hand being gently placed on the bend of the knee. Should the head be too much swelled and bruised, to be returned, it must be skinned and amputated. Direct in a straight line from the poll to the nose; force the skin back over the first joint of the neck, divide the head from the body, pushing the latter back to obtain hold of the knees. The loose skin must be previously wrapped over the ragged bone, and an assistant should have fast hold, in order to guide it clear of the haunch-bones of the cow; should it hitch there, put back instantly. No 7. If one hind-leg appear, put it back; the calf cannot be brought forth with a hinder and fore-leg together, and the difference between the knee and hough will be immediately discovered. The head being doubled back, must of course be reduced to its proper place. The cow being strong and quiet, the business may be effected with care and patience; but should the hook be positively necessary, hold must be taken, either in the sockets of the eyes, cavity of the ears, or in the jaw. The calf of droopy in the calf will be sufficiently apparent by its preternatural size; use the knife carefully, should that be necessary, to pierce the belly of the calf.\n\nThere is a very material obstruction which frequently happens to the calving of cows. It is called a horned ring of the lye or calf-bed, when the pallage of it is contracted into a very small circumference, infomuch, that face, at the full time of gestation, it will not admit to much as the smallest hand, and grows so finewy or horned, as renders it utterly impossible for the cow to calve without affluence, and many cattle have died under this dreadful inconvenience, when it might have been easily prevented; but so little has been known hitherto of the diseases peculiar to black cattle, that many thousands have fallen victims to untimely death, that a simple remedy or operation might have saved.\n\nIn the calf before observed, it must take a considerable length of time, before it is contracted, as it is often found; but no suspicion or dread can reasonably take place, until near the time when the beast has arrived at the end of nine months, her full time of bearing young: when they generally make a regular preparation, or falling of the parts of generation, for a few days, or weeks before calving; but in cases of this hornedness of the calf-bed, it is observed that they are backward in making these necessary alterations, preparatory to the approaching change; and when this is noticed, more than usual observation ought to be taken, for when they do not prepare in a regular manner, they seldom have the efforts of nature in due course, for the delivery of their burthen.\u2014But when the beast is observed sick for calving, and has reached the end of her time, and any dread of this apprehended, there is no danger or impropriety in searching with the hand, in order to be satisfied, whether that part is open, or grown.\nPART IV. HYGEIOLOGY; OR, THE MEANS OF PRESERVING THE HEALTH OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS.\n\nBefore we enter on the consideration of the diseases, that affect domestic animals, whose medical treatment is to form the subject of the remaining part of this article; it will be proper to lay down some instructions for the management of these animals in a state of health, with a view to that most important object, the avoiding of the causes of disease. The preservation of health must ever be considered as one of the principal objects of the medical practitioner, and has exercised the pens of some of the most eminent physicians in all ages. But the consideration of this subject is still more necessary in the treatment of the inferior animals, than in that of man. In the former the cure of disease is rendered much more difficult and precarious, on account of the obscurity in which the symptoms are often hid, and the difficulty which we frequently experience in investigating the causes of morbid affections.\n\nThe management of domestic animals in a state of health, chiefly respects the habitations in which they are placed, when taken from their native fields; their food and drink; cleanliness, and exercise.\n\nCHAP. I. Of Stables, Cow-houses, and Kennels.\n\nIn a state of nature, all the animals at present under our consideration, are constantly exposed to the open air, and only seek for shelter from the inclemencies of the weather under woods and thickets. The young of all these animals when domesticated, except the dog, are for a long time left in a similar state, till, for the convenience of their masters, it is found necessary to place them in habitations. The structure of these, that is of stables, cowhouses, and kennels, and the method of treating the animals confined in them, is of the utmost consequence; as on these the animals' health and comfort must in a great measure depend.\n\n1. Of Stables.\n\nStables should be built on a dry soil, that is somewhat elevated; or, at least, they must not be built in a built on a hollow, or in the neighbourhood of boggy or marshy land. The damp cold air, arising from moist, low situations, is extremely prejudicial to the health of all animals, particularly horses, and, as we shall see hereafter, to sheep. It renders them subject to colds, rheumatism, and not unfrequently to fever. Stables built in these situations are therefore always dangerous; and more particularly so, when the animals return to them after having been heated by violent exercise or labour.\n\nStables should be roomy in proportion to the number of horses that it is proposed they should contain. Per-room, perhaps no stable should be made to hold more than five or six horses, as many inconveniences arise from keeping too many of these animals in the same apartment. Not only is the air thereby much more vitiated, but the rest and sleep, so necessary to repair the fatigues of the day, are thus prevented or disturbed. Some horses will not sleep, or even lie down, if not perfectly at their ease; and hence, in large stables, that are made to contain a dozen or more horses, as is often the case in livery stables,\nbles, and such as are attached to large inns, the frequent entrance of grooms, ostlers, and other persons with lights, into the stable, and even the restless noise of some of the horses, who are more watchful, or have been less fatigued than others, must be a great disturbance to these latter. Where necessity requires a long range of stables, it is better to have them divided, by thick partition walls, into separate apartments, each made to contain not more than five horses. The additional expense of this would be trifling, compared to the greater ease and comfort of the animals.\n\nIt is usual in large stables, for the sake of keeping more horses conveniently under the same roof, to make them double-headed, as it is termed; that is, to have a range of stalls along each wall, with a space between, for persons to pass to and fro. Stables of this kind are very improper; the space between the two ranges is often so narrow, that when the opposite stalls are occupied at the same time, the horses can reach each other with their hind feet, especially when standing, as they often do, at the full length of their halters. Hence, in the contests that often arise between quarrelsome or restless horses, very severe bruises, and even lameness, are not unfrequently the consequences of the animals being within each other's reach. The danger that threatens passengers in these narrow spaces is also not small; we have often trembled, when obliged to pass between two rows of horses, kicking and wincing under the curry-combs, where the intermediate space did not exceed three or four feet. If double-headed stables must be used, the space between the ranges of stalls should be at least eight feet.\n\nThe roof of stables should not be low; for, as the foul and vitiated air, generated by respiration and the exhalations of animal bodies, naturally ascends to the highest parts, the horses, who usually carry their heads very high, are, when the ceiling of the stable is low, fully exposed to the noxious influence of this vitiated atmosphere. This is not the place to enlarge on the vitiation that the air undergoes from the action of the animals that are confined in it; this subject has already been fully considered in the article Chemistry when speaking of respiration; and, from what has been there delivered, the reader will see the necessity of pure air to horses and other animals as well as man, and will be able to judge of the propriety of the above maxim, and some others which we shall presently lay down.\n\nThe walls of the stable should be of stone or brick, and by no means of wood; they should also be left bare, or at least only covered with plaster. The temperature of the air, in buildings of stone or brick, is much more equable than in those built of wood, they are not so easily penetrated by the heat of summer, or the cold of winter, and they are also attended with another important advantage, that they resist the spreading of fire.\n\nThe stalls in which the horses are to stand should be divided from each other by strong wooden partitions, that should rise sufficiently high to prevent the horse from stepping over, but not so high as to impede the free circulation of air, and admission of light from one stall to another. The breadth of each stall should be such as will freely admit of the horse turning himself, and stretching at his full length when he lies down; but they should not be so wide as to allow of his kicking against the partition. The floor of the stall should have a gentle declivity, from the manger backwards. This allows the urine and water to run easily off; it also relieves the fore quarters of the horse, and adds much to the grace of his appearance behind. Too great a slope, however, must be avoided, as when the declivity is too rapid, all the weight of the horse is thrown on his hind legs; and, as it is extremely uneasy for the animal to remain long in this position, he is obliged to press his body forward, which he cannot accomplish, without keeping the hind legs always on the stretch; the pastern-joint, from its situation, receives the whole additional weight, and the ligament which connects it is invariably strained in all horses which are kept in this sort of stable for any length of time.\n\nA slope of one inch in six feet will be sufficient to answer every purpose.\n\nThis declivity should terminate in a hollow space a few inches from the end of the stall, forming a sort of gutter, extending the whole length of the stable, and passing out through the wall at each end, where iron bars should be placed, to admit of the water, &c., passing out of the stable, which is the intention of this gutter, but preventing the intrusion of rats, and other noxious animals.\n\nThe floor of stables is commonly paved with stone, or hard bricks made for that purpose. This kind of flooring has the advantage of being more durable than any other; but it is not without its inconveniences. The stones or bricks become smooth by wearing, and, when the stable is wet, the horse, especially if he be very frisky, is apt to slip, and endanger straining or otherwise injuring his limbs. Again, by the paving, or stamping, to which these animals are often subject, the pavement may be loosened or broken. For these reasons, it would perhaps be better that at least the stalls should be floored with strong oaken planks well seasoned, and laid across the stall, with their extremities below the partitions, and having their joining edges accurately adapted to each other. A flooring of this kind has the advantage of being more elastic, and of preserving a more equable temperature than pavement; and it is not liable to the inconveniences which we have mentioned, as attending this latter. A wooden flooring is indeed expensive, but this is more than counterbalanced by the advantages to the horse. It is of little consequence how the rest of the stable is covered; some gentlemen floor their stables with a sort of cement, which in course of time becomes as hard as stone, and has the advantage of being perfectly smooth and even. The gutter should of course be well paved.\n\nThe manger for receiving the horses' corn should be about a foot broad, and five or six inches deep. The manger is usually made of wood, and when this is the case, the boards composing it should be closely joined, that the corn cannot get through between them. The front of the manger should rise about three feet, or a little more, from the ground; should slope a little, and should terminate above by a strong rounded border. This, if the manger be made of wood, should be covered with tin plate, or white iron, as horses are very apt, when without food, or when allowed to remain long in the stall, to bite the front of the manger, and thus acquire a very bad habit, which farriers call crib-biting. Some choose to make the manger of stone, which\nThe manger is sometimes made to extend the whole length of the stable, when it is in general divided into several cavities, one for each horse. It is of little consequence whether it be one continued cavity, or whether there be a separate manger for each stall; but the manger should by no means be supported on legs, so as to make it moveable, as is sometimes done; as this prevents the litter from being conveniently flowed below the manger, and exposes the horse or the manger to accidents. It should therefore be firmly fixed at the back to the wall of the stable, and to each partition of the stall. Sometimes a hollow is made at one end of the manger, or at one end of each division of it, for the purpose of holding water. When this is done, there should be a hole in the bottom of this cavity fitted with a plug, to draw off the water when the horse has done drinking, or when the manger has been washed.\n\nIn the middle of the front of the manger, in its thick edge, there is usually fixed an iron ring, turning easily in an eye bolt, for the purpose of passing through the halter, by which the horse is fastened. Sometimes, instead of this ring, a hole is made through the border of the manger for the halter to pass through; but as the halter does not slip backwards and forwards easily through such a hole, and wears very fast by rubbing against the wood, the iron ring is to be preferred. The horse should always be fastened in such a way, as that the halter shall slide backwards and forwards with every motion of the horse's head; and he should on no account be tied by the halter, as this exposes him to accidents, by twisting the halter about his neck or legs.\n\nThe rack should be placed at such a height above the manger, as that the horse can easily reach it, to pull out the hay; it should be very strong and firmly fixed, and should incline a little outwards from the wall of the stable. The bars of which it is composed, should not be above four or five inches aunder, that the hay may not fall out and be wasted.\n\nOne circumstance particularly to be attended to in the construction of stables is, to preserve a free circulation of air.\n\nThe generality of stables are by much too close and warm; nor a chink is left for the free admission of air; the door, and windows (if there are any), are made so close, as perfectly to exclude the air; or, if this is not the case, the crevices are frequently stopped with hay, under the idea that horses cannot be kept too warm. This is a most absurd and mistaken notion; and is contradicted both by reason and daily experience. When we consider that horses in a state of nature, or even in their usual pastures, are perpetually exposed to the open air, and that, under these circumstances, they are more vigorous and active than under the most attentive care of their masters, we must be convinced of the impropriety of keeping them for hours together in the foul and heated atmosphere of the ordinary close stables. Whoever enters one of these stables when the door is first opened in the morning, after it has been closely shut up all night, will be able to judge from his own sensations, whether such an atmosphere can be wholesome to the animals that breathe it. Besides the great heat of the stable, which, if many horses have been shut up in it all night is nearly intolerable, the air will be found highly impure from the continued respiration of so many animals, and the steams arising from the exhalations of their bodies, which have probably sweated profusely from having been so long confined in an atmosphere so foul and heated. Add to this the impregnation of the air by the effluvia arising from the litter, &c.; and it is not easy to conceive a more unhealthy situation for an animal, who, to perform the offices required of him with activity and vigour, should be in the full possession of all his strength. Now it may easily be supposed, that such an air as we have described, cannot be calculated to strengthen the body of the horses. On the contrary, it must be in a high degree weakening and relaxing. In this relaxed state, the horse is probably taken out immediately into the open air, whatever may be the season or weather, and made to enter on his daily task. The effect which such a sudden change must have on the constitution of the strongest horse, need not be described. The sudden action of the cold and probably moist air on a body that has been exposed for so many hours to the heated air of the stable, must be productive of the worst consequences to the health and vigour of the animal. Accordingly, fevers, colds, rheumatism, asthma, and a number of other formidable diseases, may be traced to this debilitating source.\n\nWe should think, that the analogy of nature would have taught men to avoid such absurdities. We learn from those authors who have written on the natural history of the horse, that the Arabians, who live in tents, and are extremely careful in the management of their horses, allow them to stand all day, when not employed, at the door of the tent; and at night bring them within the tent, where they lie down in the same apartment with their master and family, sheltered indeed from the dews of the night, but freely exposed to the circulation of air that must constantly prevail in these temporary dwellings.\n\nTo avoid the inconveniences arising from confined Mode of air, the stable should be made high and roomy; the ventilator-door and windows should not be made too close; and the stable should be provided with proper ventilators. Perhaps a good method of preserving a free circulation of air in the stable at all times, would be to carry up a flue diagonally through the wall at each extremity, terminating above in a sort of chimney; and below, within the stable, in an opening sufficiently wide in any part of the wall that is not immediately within the stall.\n\nThe free admission of light into stables is nearly of Windows, as much consequence as that of air. It is a very erroneous opinion which is maintained by some grooms and stable-keepers, that horses feed best in the dark. These animals naturally love the light, and are much more cheerful and spirited in stables where this is freely admitted, than in the dark and dismal hovels that we sometimes find attached to farms and farm houses. There is one bad consequence that follows keeping horses in a dark stable, which does not appear to be sufficiently attended to. By being kept so long excluded from the light, the horse's eyes become weak, and unable to support the full glare of open day. The pupils being so long,\nHygeiology long habituated to an unusual degree of dilatation, do not readily contract when the animal is brought out into the open air; hence his eyes being offended with the strong light, to which he is so little accustomed, are perpetually winking and watering; the horse appears as if half blind, and starts and flumbles at almost every step.\n\nThe stable should, therefore, be furnished with glazed windows, in number proportioned to the size of the building. In general, no stables should have fewer than two windows; and they should be placed in such a situation, as that the horses may not receive the rays of light too directly on their eyes. Where the stable has only one range of stalls, this point can be easily effected, and in such stables, the windows should always be placed at the back of the horses. But in double stables it is not easy to place the windows so as not to inconvenience some of the horses, since, on whichever side of the stable they are made, the horses on that side are exposed to the full glare of the light; another argument against double stables. The windows should by all means be fitted; and should be made to draw down from the top, as well as to be thrown up from below. They should not be made too small, and should be carried up as near the ceiling of the stable, as is compatible with the strength and symmetry of the building. Windows constructed in this way not only add much to the appearance of the stables and to the comfort of the horses; but they afford one of the best means of promoting a free circulation of fresh air through the stable. For by throwing one of them up, and drawing another down, the ventilation becomes nearly as complete as possible.\n\nNothing has astonished us more, when viewing the handsome offices attached to some of the gentlemen's houses in this country, than to see the deficiency of the stables in the article of windows. When viewing them from without, we have congratulated the animals confined in them on the comfort of light and air, which they must enjoy from the fine sash-windows, which we saw on each side of the stable door. How great has been our astonishment on entering the building, to find all gloomy and dark within; and that the fine sash-windows which we thought we had seen at a distance, were nothing but efforts of the painter to deceive our senses, and to present an appearance of what certainly ought to have been a reality!\n\nWe must be permitted here to draw what we hope will not be considered as an invidious comparison between the Scotch and English method of lodging their horses. In England we have rarely seen such miserable hovels as, in many parts of Scotland, are used to supply the place of stables. We have indeed in the former country seen the stables sometimes very small, or even consisting of a thatched building not very well defended from the weather; but they are for the most part tolerably well ventilated, and we believe scarcely ever without windows.\n\nIt is a common practice to build stables of two stories, the upper story forming a loft for the purpose of keeping the horse's hay and corn; and in gentlemen's stables, where the building is sufficiently large, it is usual to have apartments on the upper story for the grooms and other servants employed about the stables to sleep in.\n\nThe apartment employed as a hay loft has usually a vacancy in that part of the flooring which is immediately over the rack, for the purpose of more conveniently supplying the horses with hay. This mode of building stables has its convenience in an economical point of view, and these apartments in the upper story add much to the showy appearance of the building; but there are several material objections to this construction.\n\n1. The hay and corn being kept immediately over the stable, are constantly exposed to the foul and heated air and putrid steams rising up from the stalls through the rack, and are thus rendered liable to be heated and mildewed; while the dust rising from the shaking of the hay into the rack is very prejudicial to the lungs of the horses. On this account it is much better, where this can be conveniently done, to keep the hay and corn in some place distinct from the stable, and bring from time to time a sufficient quantity of hay nearly to fill the rack, into which it might be put while the horse is abroad.\n\n2. Another serious objection to having lofts and chambers above the stable, is that the building is thus much more exposed to accidents from fire, owing to the carelessness of the servants. And,\n\n3. These apartments above the stable render the latter much too close and warm.\n\nWhere, from convenience or fancy, a gentleman chooses to build his stables in the manner which we have just described, it will be advisable to have the flooring above the stable made as close as possible, and covered with thin bricks or stones for the purpose of checking the progress of fire; and for preserving the hay and corn as much as may be from the steams of the stable, a partition wall may be raised from the extremity of the flooring immediately over the rack all the way to the roof of the loft, with a door opening over the rack in each stall. The entrance to the hay loft or chambers above the stable should be without, and by no means, as is generally the case, by a trap door and ladder within the stable. If, as we frequently see in gentlemen's offices, the stables are built on each side of the coach-house, the entrance to the rooms above may be conveniently made by a stair from the coach-house.\n\nThe building of which the stable forms a part, should be as much as possible detached from other buildings, so as to admit of a free circulation of air all around.\n\nIt is a vile practice which is common on many farms and in some inns, to have the dung-hill or midden, should be close to the stable. This nuisance should be removed apart from as far as possible from the door and windows of the stable, as the heat and noxious vapors arising from the fermenting dung impregnate the air to a considerable extent.\n\nIt is of great consequence that the stable be kept clean swept and clean. It should therefore be regularly swept every morning, and every part of the litter that is wet and dirty should be removed to the dunghill, while what is clean and dry should be put up close below the manger, unless where the horse is lame, or has any affection of the feet or limbs, which renders it necessary for him to stand upon soft litter. Where the horse is perfectly healthy, no litter should be allowed in the day time, much less should the stall be crammed with litter, as is often done, and is suffered to remain in this situation for many days, for the purpose of increasing the quantity of manure. Nothing injures the feet\nHygeiology feet of horses more, or more frequently produces softness of the hoof, canker, and greasy heels, than allowing them to stand night and day on hot, fermenting dung. It is also impossible for the horse to lie down in comfort in such a hot-bed; and if the poor animal is obliged to recline himself for a time, he is soon compelled to rise again, and repeatedly making the same attempt at rest, and finding it impracticable, he is forced at length to stand altogether, perhaps shifting his legs from one part of the stall to another, to avoid the heat of the dung.\n\nLord Pembroke is of opinion that after working, and at night of course, as also in lamenesses and sicknesses, it is good for horses to stand on litter; it also promotes itching, &c. At other times it is a bad custom; the constant use of it heats and makes the feet tender, and causes swollen legs. Moreover it renders the animal delicate. Swelled legs may frequently be reduced to their proper natural size, by taking away the litter only, which, in some stables, where ignorant grooms and farriers govern would be a great favoring of phthisic and bleeding, besides straw. \"I have seen,\" (says he), \"by repeated experiments, legs swell and unswell, by leaving litter, or taking it away, like mercury in a weather-glass.\"\n\nIt is a very common practice to keep horses, while in the stable, covered up with warm clothing. This is in some cases necessary, especially when they are under a course of phthisic, or are otherwise so delicate, as that they would be liable to injury from too much exposure to the air. But its indiscriminate use is highly improper, as it tends to render the horse too delicate, and exposes him to the danger of catching cold whenever he goes out into the air. While a horse is in complete health, and stands idle, he requires very little, if any covering, unless the stable be extremely cold, or ill sheltered. When indeed he comes into the stable, much heated by violent exercise or hard labour, it may be proper to throw over him a single cloth, that he may cool gradually. Some grooms think it necessary, besides enveloping the horse with body clothes, to gird them fast round his belly with tight rollers; and this is done with the view of taking up the horse's belly, as they term it. The practice is exceedingly absurd, for these tight rollers impede the circulation in the superficial veins, produce difficult breathing, and if they be applied, as is often the case, after eating, they greatly obstruct digestion.\n\nTo finish the subject of stable economy, we have only to make a few remarks on currying, or dressing horses.\n\nFriction employed on the horse's skin is not only necessary to keep him clean, and to promote the insensible perspiration, by freeing the skin and hair from impurities, but it is exceedingly useful when considered as a kind of exercise. It promotes the free circulation of the blood, which is much impeded by the horse standing long idle in the stable; and it much improves the appearance of the horse's coat. Horses should therefore be regularly dressed, at least twice a-day.\n\nThere are, however, some cases in which general friction ought not to be employed; such are cases of internal inflammation, especially of the bowels; or when there is a discharge of sharp ichorous matter from any part, especially the legs and heels. In these cases the affected parts should not be rubbed, as it would tend to increase the pain and distress arising from the inflammation.\n\n2. Of Cow-houses, or Byres.\n\nAfter what we have said on the construction of stables, we need not here enlarge on that of cow-houses or cattle byres, as these buildings, so far at least as respects their outsides, are constructed on similar principles. We shall take occasion, when treating on the manner of feeding cattle, to describe a byre that appears to us to afford a good model for buildings of this kind.\n\nIt is of material importance in the wintering of young stock, to keep them more warm, and sheltered from wet, than is usually done, as by this means they thrive fatter, with a less consumption of food, than in the contrary circumstances. This may be effected, either by tying them up in stalls, in houses for the purpose, or by keeping them in good sheds in well inclosed yards.\n\nThe question of feeding the cattle tied up, or loose in the yards, in winter, has not been yet decided. Each method has probably advantages. In the first, the cattle thrive better than when left at liberty to run about the yards. Mr Marshall found that in Yorkshire, cattle kept tied up, and regularly fed with straw in a moderate proportion, did better than in the southern parts of the island, where left loose in the midst of greater plenty. Whether this effect is to be ascribed to the greater warmth, the resting better, or the being fed more regularly, and eating with an appetite, he cannot determine. Some experiments of Mr Young's also lead to the conclusion that cattle flock thrive better when tied up. They likewise show that the practice of tying up is the only one that can be had recourse to, where straw is not in great plenty, and the quantity of the stock very inadequate to its consumption.\n\nIn the latter method there is the advantage of a large supply of manure, especially where the farmer has the convenience of litter. Where however the farmer has convenience, the former method is probably in general the most beneficial. In either mode of management much attention is necessary to keeping the stock constantly supplied in an evenly proportioned manner, as in this way there will be great advantage, both in the saving of food, and the condition of the animals.*\n\nDickson's Agriculture, vol. ii.\n\nThe necessity of providing shelter for cattle in bad weather, is now we believe pretty well understood by every intelligent farmer; and experience has proved that proper buildings erected for winter feeding are attended with considerable advantages. The erection for this purpose at Hafod in Wales, the residence of Thomas Johnes, Esq., M.P. for the county of Cardigan, and one of the most eminent improvers of the present time, seem to be calculated upon a moderate scale. The whole length of the building is fifty feet, the roof shelving, its chief height being fourteen feet, the lower extremities, one seven and a half, the other six feet. A stone wall running up to the summit, parts the feeding-house from the other and smaller apartment, which is a receptacle for dung. Width of the feeding-house, nineteen feet within-side. Stalls each twelve feet long by four feet two inches wide. Gangway three feet and a half, at the heels and tails of the cattle, leading from the doors, the first door being for the cattle, the other for\nHygeiology for the attendants. Similar doors at the opposite ends of the building. Running water in troughs, with racks, and mangers. The cattle lie on wooden platforms, perforated for the passage of the urine. The urine runs, and the dung is pushed through apertures in the wall, each of which is two feet square, and one between every two stalls. There are 12 wooden flaps or windows to give light and air, to each stall. The dung pit is about twelve feet wide, sunk some feet deep in the earth, extending the whole length of the building. The walls are built partly with stone, and in part with wood, the roof with larch wood, as an experiment of its durability in that exposure.\n\nAccording to Mr Lawrence, the round or quadrangular form might perhaps, either of them, be more economical as to space and materials for a building to contain a considerable number. The oxen would most conveniently stand around with their tails toward the wall, contrary to the usual practice, for the more easy throwing out the dung from a gangway, through apertures purposely made in the wall, into a pit, under cover, sunk around the building. The area within would, of course, be for feeding, and every necessary purpose of attendance. A store-chamber above completes the building, the chief objection to the form of which, is the greater expense attendant upon the reversed position of the cattle, which perhaps is compensated by the great saving of labour, in the more easily getting rid of the dung. The gangway will in course be sufficiently wide to admit the beasts to and from their stalls; the dung aperture in the wall may be closed in cold weather.*\n\nOf all domestic animals, sheep are the most exposed to the inclemencies of the weather. This arises chiefly from their numbers, which renders complete shelter very difficult; but even in the case of a small flock, the prejudices of many feeders have prevented their procuring proper shelter for their sheep, under the idea that it would render them too lazy to provide for themselves. These prejudices, however, are gradually wearing away, and few sheep-farms are at present unprovided with shelter, either of trees or buildings. Mr Findlater, in his able survey of Peebles, strongly recommends shelter for sheep. \"It would be (says this gentleman) for the interest of every proprietor of sheep farms, to encourage the farmer to rear shelter of trees, by allowing him the seedings of the plantation, and becoming bound to pay the farmer, at the rate of perhaps eight-pence or ten-pence a piece, for every tree left standing at specified distances, at the expiry of his lease; such an interest communicated to the farmer, would give the most effectual security for the protection of the trees. Shelters are also procured by buildings, enclosing a square open area in the middle, furnished with shades, on every side. Stalls (that is circular spaces of area, proportioned to the size of the flock, enclosed by a five or six feet wall of stone, or sod, without any roof) were the primeval shelters invented by our forefathers. The circular figure of the building causes the drifting wind in snow storms to wheel round it, without rising over it, and depositing the snow in the calm region within. The sheep are fed, in winter storms, with such provision as can be procured, under the trees, in the sheds, and within the circles. Even where no feeding is administered, much advantage results to the animals, from mere defence against the weather; and they are much more alert in searching for natural food, so soon as the storm ceases. The mode of acting of the sheep gives a pretty certain indication of the weather to be expected: Upon the near approach of a storm, those accustomed to shelters are observed to make for their shelters. Upon the near approach of thaw, their sentiment leads them to be less industrious in digging the snow for food, as if conscious that such labour was no longer necessary.\"*\n\nAccording to Mordaunt, who wrote about the middle of last century, sheep pens and houses, were then not uncommon in Essex and Gloucestershire. He directs the pens to be made at some convenient corner of a pasture, or where several fields, commons, or pastures meet, so as to be common to them all. They should also be erected on a dry spot of ground, and stones laid at the bottom to keep the sheep dry and clean, whilst under examination. The pens to be divided into partitions to hold about forty sheep.\n\n\"The sheep-houses, for warmth in the winter season, are made low, and a third part longer than broad, and rather large, the sides lined with furze or boards, for warmth; the bottom laid with large stone slabs, and very level, that the urine run not away, but soak into the litter. It would be proper to have the sunny side well lined with moveable hurdles, that when the sun shines it may be laid open to give the sheep a refreshment, by letting them into some close or croft, wherein the sheep-house stands: the house to be well covered.\"\n\n3. Of Dog-kennels.\n\nIt is usually recommended to erect a particular building, for the sole purpose of a kennel; and certainly where the proprietor's fortune will admit of it, such an appropriate building is to be preferred. A common barn has, however, often been employed as a kennel; and Mr Daniel says, that the excellence of the hounds kept in such a building has been rivalled by few that were lodged in the most sumptuous edifices.\n\nWhatever may be the form or original intention of the building, cleanliness is absolutely necessary, both to the nose of the hound and the preservation of his health. The sense of smelling is so exquisite in a hound, that every stench must be supposed injurious to it; upon that faculty all our hopes depend, and nostrils clogged with the effluvia of a dirty kennel, are ill adapted to carry the scent over greatly fallows, or guide one through the foil of deer, or over ground tainted by sheep. Dogs are by nature cleanly; where they lie, if they can avoid it, they seldom dung. Air and fresh straw are essential to preserve them healthy. They are subject to the mange; naughtiness very much contributes to this, and although at the first appearance it may be easily checked the remedies that are used are in themselves strong in their operation, and will do no good to the hounds' constitution. Let the cleanliness of the kennel, therefore, be carefully attended to; a resort to these remedies will then be unnecessary, and all injury to hounds from this source will be prevented.\n\nOn the presumption that a kennel is to be erected, its site is strongly pointed out by Somerville.\nUpon some little eminence erect\nAnd fronting to the ruddy dawn, its courts\nOn either hand wide opening to receive\nThe sun's all-cheering beams, when mild he shines\nAnd gilds the mountains tops.\n\nBut this selection of a high situation is incompatible with a running brook; and as these two advantages cannot be united, water is to be preferred, with the aspect to the morning sun as much attended to as possible.\n\nThe number of its inmates must determine the size of the kennel; and the architecture should be neat, without being uselessly expensive. The most magnificent is the duke of Richmond's at Goodwood, which cost \u00a310,000, and is sufficiently extensive for two packs of hounds. The building comprises five kennels, two 36 by 15, three 30 by 15, and two feeding rooms 20 by 15 feet, with stoves to warm the air, when too cold.\n\nThe huntman and whipper-in have each a parlour, kitchen, and sleeping-room.\n\nThe nearer to the house the kennel is placed the better. There are reasons against its too close approach, but they yield to others which forbid a great distance. To mention one, derived indeed from a vulgar saying, \"that the master's eye makes the horse fat;\" recollect that the inspection of the kennel, is even more needful than that of the stable; for in both, cleanliness is no less essential than food.\n\nThe kennel should be of sufficient dimensions at its first building; room for two kennels should be under the same roof; when there is but one, it is seldom sweet; and when washed out, the hounds, particularly in winter, not only suffer during the time of cleaning, but as long afterwards as it remains wet. The second kennel affords opportunity for drafting the hounds intended to hunt the next morning. In a few days they will be drafted with little trouble, will readily answer to their names; and with equal ease as a shepherd numbers his sheep, you may count your hounds into the hunting kennel.\n\nIn a morning, upon the feeder's first entering the kennel, he should let the hounds into the outer court; the door of the hunting kennel, when not occupied by the drafted hounds for that day's hunting, should be opened in bad weather to shelter them; the lodging-room should then be thoroughly cleaned, the windows and doors opened, the litter well shaken, and the kennel made sweet, before the hounds are again shut into it. Every omission prejudicial to the hounds should be immediately pointed out to the feeder, who must be made to remedy it; and also observe that the great court and the other kennels are equally objects of his attention.\n\nThe lodging-room should be bricked, and flopped on both sides to the centre, where should be a gutter to carry off the water, that when walked, the floor may be equally dried: but flagstones, or large square bricks termed pannonds, are far preferable; there are fewer interstices, and consequently less filth or water can there accumulate, and the surface is sooner dry. Let the floor be kept in thorough repair, that no water may remain in any cavity, until the mason can be had, when at any time wanted; let the stagnant water be carefully stopped up; for nothing is more hurtful to hounds, than damp, or more refreshing than warmth after hard work.\n\nThe kennel should have three doors; two in front and one behind; that in the back to have a lattice window in it, with a wooden shutter, which is to be kept always closed, except in summer, when it should be left open the whole of the day. This door has a twofold utility, it serves to carry out the dirty straw, and being opposite to the window, will admit a thorough air, when the lodging-room is cleaned, which will much contribute to render it sweet and wholesome. The front doors will be useful in drying the room when the hounds are out; and as one is to be shut and the other hooked back, so as to allow a single dog to pass, they are not liable to any objection. The large centre window should have a folding shutter, which at night, according to the weather, may be wholly or partially closed; and thus the warmth of the kennel may be regulated as is judged most salutary. The two great lodging rooms are exactly similar, and having a court belonging to each, are distinct kennels situated at the opposite ends of the building. In the centre of the boiling-house and feeding-yard, a lesser kennel, either for hounds that are drafted off, hounds that are sick and lame, or for any other required purpose, is on each side; at the back of which, it being but half the depth of the two larger kennels, are places for coals, &c. for the use of the kennel. There is also a small building in the rear for hot bitches.\n\nThe inner-court floor should be bricked or flagged, and flopped towards the centre like those of the lodging-room; and water brought in by a leaden pipe, should run through the channel in the middle. In the centre of each court is a well sufficiently large to dip a bucket for the purpose of cleaning the kennel. To keep these from wanting repair, they should be faced with stone, and to that of the feeding-yard a wooden cover should be fixed. The benches, which must be open to let the urine through, should have hinges and hooks in them all, that they may fold up when the kennel is washed. They should be made as low as possible, that when a hound is tired, he may have no difficulty in jumping up, and at no time be able to creep under them. Recollect that if, owing to the smallness of the hound, as in beagles, it should be difficult to make the benches sufficiently low, it will be proper to nail a ledging projecting downwards in the edge, or the benches may be faced with boards at bottom, to prevent the hounds from creeping under.\n\nA large brick court in front, having a grass court adjoining, and a brook running through the middle of it, completes the kennel. This court should be planted round, and also have some lime trees and some horse chestnuts near the centre for shade. Some posts bound round with straw, rubbed with galbanum, may be placed so as to prevent the hounds from making water against the trees. The brook may be used as a cold bath for hounds lamed, in the flitie, in strains, or for other purposes for which the cold bath is required. A high palings should inclose the whole, and which, to the height of four feet, should be close, the remainder being open, with an interval of two inches between the pales. At the back of the kennel should be a thatched house, fenced at the sides, to contain at least a load of straw.\nHygeiology a pit for receiving the dung, and a gallows for the flesh. If a piece of ground adjoining to the kennel can conveniently be enclosed, for keeping such horses as may be brought alive for the use of the hounds, it would be of great service, as the disorders of condemned horses are not always ascertained; and an opportunity may thus be offered of investigating their nature and progress, which may prove advantageous in future similar cases. The hounds may also be brought into this field, to empty themselves after feeding; and the draught for the next day's hunt can be here made with greater accuracy than when they are confined to the kennel.\n\nStoves are used in some kennels; but a good feeder, and the mop properly applied, render them unnecessary. Should ticks prove troublesome at any time, the walls of the kennel should be well washed; and if that should fail to destroy the ticks, they must be white-washed with lime.\n\nWhen the hunting season is over, one kennel will be sufficient, and the other with the grass-yard adjoining to it may be allowed to the young hounds. This separation, which should continue till the season commences, is necessary for preventing many accidents that might otherwise happen at this time of the year. Should there be conveniences, it will be proper to keep the dogs separate from the bitches during the summer months. When hounds are very riotous, the feeder may sleep in a cot in an adjoining kennel; if the dogs are well chastised at the first quarrel, his voice will afterwards be sufficient to keep them quiet.\n\n**Chap. II. Of Diet.**\n\nIn preserving the health of domestic animals, much will depend on the quantity and quality of their food, and on the manner in which they are supplied with it. This subject, therefore, requires some share of our attention. We have already, in the article Agriculture, treated pretty much at large on the different kinds of food that are most proper for horses, sheep, and cattle; and have here little to add on that head. Our principal object in this chapter will be, to consider the best means of dispensing food to the different classes of domestic animals, and to describe what are considered the most beneficial methods of preparing the food in those cases where its preparation appears to be necessary.\n\nThe natural food of the horse is the simple herbage of the field, and on it alone he can be constantly kept in a high state of health and vigour, so long as he shall not be required to labour; and whilst he is employed in labour, grass in some form, either dried or green, seems absolutely necessary to his maintenance in a healthy state. Hay, straw, and corn of various kinds have been, from the earliest times, the common food of horses; but in Britain, and indeed in France and Germany, during later periods especially, they have rejected all other species of horse-corn; from a well-grounded preference in favour of oats and beans; the latter for draught-horses chiefly, or as substantial auxiliaries to the oats, imparting as strong a nourishment as the constitution of the horse will properly bear, and at the same time of a cleansing nature; and are, moreover, the best and cheapest in-door fattening for almost all domestic animals.\n\nThe species of corn usually given to horses in many countries is barley, the bulky provender is straw, both of which in warm climates, are said to be nearly equal in nutriment to our oats and hay. With us, barley is apt to fester horses, and make their urine red, especially at its first being given. Wheat is often given to horses of the great upon the continent; it is said when Philip of Spain was in this country, his jennets were fed upon wheat during the time of scarcity, and this gave great umbrage to the people.\n\nThere seems to exist no particular difference of quality between the white and the black oats, they being equal in weight and thinness of bulk; these criteria, and their being short, are the best marks of their goodness. It is equally well known that they should be some months old when used, as new oats are apt to swell the belly and produce gripes.\n\nNew beans are improper for horses, for the same reason. The best remedy is to dry them in a kiln. Old beans should be split, and given either with bran or chaff; or the best way would be to break them in a mill. Mr Lawrence fed cart-horses with beans for nearly seven years, without experiencing any ill effect from such food; but the horses laboured very hard. Beans contain more solid nourishment than oats, but of a less salutary nature.\n\nGrains constantly loosen a horse, and impoverish his blood; bran scouring and weakens the entrails; both of them are good occasional dietetic alternatives.\n\nCarrots are said to purify and sweeten the blood, to amend the wind, and to replenish after the wastings occasioned by disease orordinate labour. Mr Lawrence informs us that he has been accustomed to use them for years in all forms, and to all descriptions of horses. They are either given in spring or autumn to high-fed horses, as a change of diet, at the rate of one feed per day, in lieu of a feed of corn, or as full substitute to others. They ought to be washed clean, and, if large, cut into flat and sizeable pieces. The quantity of carrots for a feed is from half a peck to a peck.\n\nThe usual periods of feeding with corn are in this country, morning, noon, and night. The quantities feeding each time either a quarter or half a peck, with or without about two handfuls of beans, according to the horse's state of body. Much greater care than is common ought to be taken in fitting the oats clean from dust, and the dung of mice. Water should be allowed without fail twice a day. There is an error not unfrequent among stable people, who suppose water to be at best but a kind of necessary evil to horses, and therefore think it a point gained whenever they can find an opportunity to abridge the quantity. But how well founded a horse may shift with little or no water while in the field, and while feeding on succulent meat, much mischief may ensue from its being withheld; and this may produce colic, gripes, inflammation of the bowels, perpetual longing, and a danger of drinking to excess on every opportunity.\n\nThe well-known use of hay is to dilate the body of the horse, to satisfy his appetite with bulk and quantity, as corn does with compact and solid nourishment. British hay, the best in the world, contains great nourishment,\nHygeiology nourishment, and will keep a horse and even fatten him; but he is unable to labour upon hay alone, and experience has shown that Breckin's observation of the constant use of hay injuring the sight of horses, particularly if suddenly put on such food after good keeping, is very just. Hard upland hay is the best for race and coach horses; and it should be of a fine, greenish colour, fragrant scent, and full of flower. It is said that horses and cattle prefer such hay as has been sweated, or which has undergone a partial fermentation; and it is even thought that they grow much sooner fat on heated hay than on such as has been gotten up dry and cool. There can be no doubt that sweated hay contains a considerable quantity of sugar, formed during its state of fermentation; this may render the hay more palatable to the beasts, but we have some doubt whether it be so wholesome as fresh well-coloured hay. Clover-hay, and hay of artificial grasses, from its goodness, is appropriated to cart-horses. Without attempting to ascertain the precise quantity, it may be said that hay should be given as often as a horse has a keen appetite for it; but great care should be taken that so much be never allowed at once, as that he shall leave it, and blow upon it. At night a considerable quantity of hay is usually left in the rack, and this is no doubt absolutely necessary for horses who are hard worked during the day, as night is their most leisure time for feeding; but it admits of doubt whether horses who live in a state of luxury, and are but little worked, should be indulged in much hay at night.\n\nIt will obviously occur to most people, that the quantity and quality of a horse's food should be proportioned to his labour; that horses who are lightly worked, will not in general require so much or so nourishing food, as those who are constantly kept to hard labour. It is evident that when horses stand idle, and are at the same time fed, they are exposed to many dangerous diseases, as inflammation, staggers, arising from a too full habit of body; and these diseases will be more likely to come on when a horse that has been thus fed is suddenly put to hard labour, or obliged to make any unusual or violent exertion. But this must not be carried too far. Horses should not, because they have little work at the time, be entirely confined to grass, or grass and hay, unless they are at pasture, and are never worked. For while a horse stands in the stable, and is liable to be called upon at any emergency, his diet should be so regulated, as that he shall neither be so fat and full of blood, as not to perform occasional work without difficulty and danger, nor on the other hand, so poor and weak, as to be incapable of supporting exertion without injury to himself or rider. All horses that are fed on grass and hay alone, are too weak to perform a good day's journey without stumbling. A moderate quantity of corn or other hard food, should therefore be allowed to such horses as stand constantly in the stable, or who, while at pasture, are occasionally worked.\n\nMr Clark observes, that throwing great quantities of clean grain before horses at one time is very improper; as they eat it too greedily, and swallow whole mouthfuls of it almost dry. The moisture in the stomach, or water drunk immediately after eating, causes the grain to swell, and thus the stomach is greatly distended, and loses its contracting power on the food. By the pressure of the full stomach on the intestines, the passage of the food backwards is obstructed, and the confined air, arising from the indigested food, not having a ready passage backwards, and horses not possessing the power of belching, the air becomes rarefied to a great degree, the horse is seized with colic pains; as these increase he becomes convulsed, and in many cases the stomach bursts. Out of a number of cases where the above was discovered on dissecting the bodies, Mr Clark mentions the two following.\n\n\"A young draught-horse was fed in the morning with too great a quantity of barley mixed with peas, and had been allowed to drink water immediately thereafter. He was yoked to a two-wheeled chaise, in order to travel a few miles, and was observed about the middle of the day to be very uneasy, frequently attempting to lie down. As soon as he was unyoked he lay down and tumbled about, frequently lying on his back, starting up suddenly and turning his head towards his belly. He continued thus in great agony till towards next morning, when he died. Upon opening his body, the stomach was found burst, the barley and peas mostly entire, only greatly swelled, and the whole contents of the stomach spread through the abdomen.\n\n\"The other case was a horse who had been fed with too great a quantity of oats and barley, and had been allowed to drink water freely afterwards. He was seized with gripping pains, so that he frequently lay down and tumbled, seemingly tortured with the most acute pains. He died next day. Upon opening his body, the stomach was found distended to an enormous size, but was not burst. Its coats were very thin, from the great distention it had undergone, that its cohesion was almost destroyed, and had more the appearance of a coat of mucus, or slime, than the stomach. The oats and barley were for the most part entire as they were swallowed, only greatly swelled from the moisture they had imbibed.\n\n\"From the cases now related, it will appear how necessary it is not to allow horses to eat too great a quantity of clean grain at a time, but to give it in small quantities, and repeated the more frequently. At the same time, it will show the propriety of mixing with it a little chopped straw, or hay, in order to make them chew it more thoroughly before they swallow it. This process also prepares the food for being properly digested, and not a single grain of it is lost.\"\n\nThe method of feeding horses with bruited grain and cut straw is recommended by the earl of Pembroke, in his excellent treatise on horses, as exceedingly proper. \"Every grain (says he) goes to nourishment: none is to be found in the dung; and three feeds of it go further than four as commonly given which have not been in the mill. But wheaten straw, and a little hay sometimes mixed with it, is excellent food. To a quantity of corn, put the same quantity of straw. It obliges them to chew their meat, and is many other ways of use.\"\n\nMr Lawrence disapproves of the use of straw, as containing no nourishment. In this he probably goes too far, as both horses and cattle are in straw-yards often fed with little else. He prefers chaff, or cut clover hay, to mix with the corn, especially for cart-horses. Mr Lawrence, however, allows that cutting up\nHygeiology up unthrashed oats for food is a good practice, particularly when hay is scarce; as thrashing and dressing of the oats are thus saved, and it is an economical expenditure of the oats, which are moreover very fresh, and agreeable to the horse.\n\nIt has of late been recommended to bruise the corn in a mill, before giving it to the horse, and it is certainly a good practice, as there is thus little danger of its passing through the bowels undigested. It is usual only to bruise the corn, but Mr Lawrence thinks that it is better to grind them as fine as possible. Whole corn, with whatever it may be mixed, will, much of it, be swallowed in that state; a great deal only half masticated, which will elude the digestive powers of the animal, and be ejected from his body crude and unbroken. This is particularly the case with brood-mares and young stock, the bellies of which are full of slippery grats; such should ever have ground corn, and mash should always be made with it. Ground buck-wheat agrees well enough with horses, but that species of corn is the least substantial.\n\nMr Lawson, a merchant of London, has lately published an essay, on the use of Mixed and Compressed Cattle Fodder, intended as food and fattening for horses, oxen, sheep, and hogs. His plan is, to grind, cut, mix and compress all the articles in present use, as food for cattle, with some additional ones of his own recommending; and to keep the mats stowed in casks, or other close storage. He gives a detailed account of all the instruments necessary in the process, the most commodious methods according to his own practice, and various tables of expense and quantities.\n\nWith respect to the drink of horses, we have little to remark. Their water should be as pure as possible, as muddy and hard water is not only very unpleasant to the horse, but probably lays the foundation of gravelly complaints. It is a very absurd custom, which is however very prevalent, to gallop the horse after watering, with the view, according to the groom's idea, of warming the water in his belly; for if the horse has drunk heartily, as he is very often improperly allowed to do, any violent exertion immediately after cannot but occasion great uneasiness. It is, however, a good practice to ride the horse moderately before watering; but care should be taken, not to throw him into a perspiration, as drinking cold water in this state is attended with considerable danger.\n\nThe feeding of cattle is of considerable importance to the farmer, and has of late been much improved. Both the food and the manner of administering it must be different according to the age of the cattle, the season of the year, and the purposes for which the cattle are fed.\n\nIt has been well observed in a late useful practical work, that in the winter the yearlings should be fed with hay and roots, either turnips, carrots, or potatoes; and they should be thoroughly well fed, and kept perfectly clean by means of litter. At this age it is a matter of great consequence to keep such young cattle as well as possible; for the contrary practice will inevitably stop their growth, which cannot be recovered by the best summer food. If hay is not to be had, good straw must be substituted; but then the roots should be given in greater plenty, and with more attention. To steers and horses two years old, the proper food is hay, if cheap, or straw, with baits of turnips, cabbages, &c.*\n\nMr Donaldson thinks the advantages of green winter food for live stock, so great, that there is no way in which it can be applied with greater benefit than \"by giving the young cattle a daily allowance during the first two or three winters.\" Whenever straw is employed as fodder for young stock, without the above forts of food, if it be not very good, or slightly mixed with some grassy material, a little hay should always be blended with it, in order that it may be preferred in proper condition. It is also of consequence that the animals be served with this sort of fodder, in a regular manner, as where too much is given at a time, Mr Marshall has remarked, that they do not thrive so well.\n\nThe following observations of Sir John Sinclair merit every attention.\n\n\"Some intelligent graziers recommend the following mode of feeding and fattening cattle. Suppose there are four inclosures, of from six to ten acres each, one of them should be kept quite free from stock till the grass has got up; and then the prime or falling cattle, should be put into it, that they may get the best of the food: the second best should then follow; and the young store after all, making the whole feed over the four inclosures in succession, as follows.\n\n1st Inclosure. Free from stock, till ready for the best cattle.\n\n2nd ditto. For the best cattle, till sent to No. 1.\n\n3rd ditto. For the second best, till sent to No. 2.\n\n4th ditto.* For the young cattle, till sent to No. 3.\n\nNo. 4. is then kept free from stock till the grass gets up, and it is ready for the prime cattle. The proper size of inclosures has never yet been ascertained by experiment; probably from 10 to 30 acres is the best; but the size should be varied, as small ones are better calculated for grass, and large ones for corn. Probably the best plan to adopt is, to feed cattle entirely in the house, or feeding them as it is technically called. In that case, small inclosures must be preferred, as the shelter they afford is extremely favourable to the growth of the herbage.\n\nThe larger a bullock is, he must take the more food to support him. It is desirable to change his food often, and to give him frequently, but little at a time, which makes him more eager to eat. After his kidneys are covered with fat, he will take less meat every week. It is better, therefore, to ascertain the quantity he eats, by the week, than by the day.\n\nFattening cattle, to be sold immediately from the farmer's house, and not sent to market, should be kept moderately warm. If kept too hot it makes them perspire, and their skins to itch: this vexes them, and they rub themselves against any wall or post within their reach, which is much against quick feeding. Currying and combing them are useless practices; and washing them, at least once a-week, is of great service. Bleeding is now exploded, as an old and unnecessary practice.\n\nIn some parts of the kingdom, the whole attention of the farmer is dedicated to fiddling, or, in other words, to feeding calves, for supplying the market with veal. In Essex, this plan is reckoned more profitable than the dairy, and next to grazing. But the profit there must depend much upon the immediate neighbourhood of...\nThe particulars connected with this branch of rural economy, will, it is probable, be fully detailed, in the improved Agricultural Survey of Effex, in so far as regards that and the neighbouring districts. But as the mode of fuckling, adopted in some parts of Scotland, is extremely different, it may not be improper to give a short account of it in this place. As soon as the calf is dropped, it is put into a box made of coarse boards, four feet and a half or five feet long, and four feet, or four feet and a half high, and about two feet wide, according to the size of the calf. The boards are not put so close but that a sufficient quantity of air is admitted; light is, however, carefully excluded; and the box has a cover for that purpose. The box stands on four feet, which, at one end, are four inches high, but at the other, only two inches; and, as there are holes at the bottom, all wetness is drained off. The bottom is also covered with straw or hay, which is changed twice a week. For seven or eight days, milk is but cautiously given, for unless a calf is fed moderately at first, it is apt to take a loathing to its food. It should be bled in about ten days; and afterwards, as much milk given it fresh from the cow, either twice or thrice a day, as it will take. The bleeding should be repeated once a week; and at all times when a calf loathes its milk, and does not feed well, bleeding ought to be repeated. These frequent bleedings prevent dilutions from plethora, to which calves are subject, even when not fed too high, and still more so when they are. A large piece of chalk should be hung up in the box, which the calf will lick occasionally: this contributes nothing to the whiteness of the veal; but it amuses the animal, and corrects that acidity in the stomach which might otherwise be engendered, and which certainly often takes place. A cow calf is reckoned the best veal; if a bull calf is fuckled, he ought to be cut when about a week old, otherwise the veal will neither be so good nor so white. By this mode of treatment, calves are kept clean, quiet, warm, and dry; the veal they furnish is excellent, and they are soon ready for the market; and, on the whole, it seems to be preferable to the practice of stupifying them with spirits, or with laudanum, so common in other places where a different system is pursued.\n\nThe supposed necessity of beginning to feed oxen at an early age, is a great objection to their being generally used, as they are hardly trained properly to work, before it is thought necessary to fatten them, after which they do very little work; but, in consequence of the improved mode of fattening by oil-cake, &c., there is no difficulty to fatten oxen, even at twelve years of age, which is a material circumstance in their favour.*\n\nIt is now very generally understood, that the more cleanly and comfortably cattle are kept, and the cleaner and better the order in which their food is presented to them, the better they will thrive, and consequently the sooner they will fatten, and the heavier they will be. With these views, and with the additional view of saving a greater proportion of the dung and urine of the cattle than is usually done, so as to increase the quantity of manure as much as possible, a byre has been constructed by Mr Hunter of Blackness in Forfarshire, which has been found on trial, completely to answer the ends proposed. The byre consists of two apartments, an inner apartment, or byre for feeding the cattle, and an outer apartment or barn for containing the turnips and fodder.\n\nAt the proper season when the turnips are completely ripened; and the turnip feeding commences, the turnips are gathered together on the field in large quantities, and two or three men with coarse turnip knives made from old scythes, cut off the whole of the roots, carefully cleaning the turnips at the same time, from any earth which may adhere to them. The turnips are then carted to the turnip barn, the door of which is wide enough to allow the carts to back in, and throw them down. Here the men with their turnip knives are again ready immediately to cut off the whole green tops or shaws of the turnips, and these green tops are immediately given to cows, young winterling cattle, sheep, &c., who readily eat them when fresh. The turnips, now quite clean, are piled up in one end of the barn like cannon balls, and will keep in excellent order for months together. Should the winter storm set in, a small quantity of clean dry straw laid over them, will effectually preserve them from being injured by the frost. The other end of the barn receives the straw and litter for the use of the byre. The advantages proposed to be derived from this method of treating the turnips are, 1. The preservation of a great many of the best turnips, which, if allowed to remain on the field during winter, are unavoidably spoiled by the effects of the weather, and the alternate operations of snow, rain, and frost. 2. The green tops being cut off fresh and good, are immediately consumed, in place of being entirely lost if allowed to remain on the field. 3. It saves much labour and trouble, both to men and horses, to lay in a stock of turnips at once, in place of going to the field every day, whether good or bad, and when, as the fields are necessarily wet and soft, the horses, carts, and harness, are severely strained, and the fields poached and cut up.\n\nLastly, By having a couple of months supply of turnips in the barn, you are never under the necessity of using frosted turnips, which are often little better than lumps of ice. And even if you should not incline, or find it convenient, to lay in too large a stock of turnips at once, still you can take the advantage of any good fresh day, as it occurs, to add to your stock of turnips in the barn.\n\nAt right angles to the turnip barn, stands the feeding byre, constructed as follows. At the distance of about three feet and a half from the great side wall of the byre, there are constructed on the ground, in a straight line, ten troughs for feeding ten large cattle; these are of hewn pavement on all sides, and at the bottom; and they are divided from each other by divisions or bridges, likewise of hewn pavement. These troughs are so constructed, that there is a small and gradual declivity from the first or innermost, to the last and outermost one; and the bridges separating them, being made with a small arch at the bottom, a pail or bucket of water poured in at the uppermost, runs out at the undermost one, through a stone spout passing through the wall, and a sweep with a broom, carries off the whole remains of the turnips, &c., rendering the whole troughs quite clean and sweet. The whole food of the cattle is thus kept perfectly clean at all times.\n\nIn a line with the feeding troughs, and immediately over\nHygeiology over them, runs a large strong beam of wood, from one end of the byre to the other, which is strengthened by two strong upright supporters to the roof, placed at equal distances from the ends of the byre, and the main beam is again subdivided by the cattle stakes and chains, so as to keep each of the ten oxen opposite to his own feeding trough and stall.\n\nThe three and a half feet of space betwixt the feeding troughs and outer wall of the byre, lighted at the farther end by a glazed window, is the cattle-feeder's walk, who passes along it in front of the cattle; and, with a basket, deposits before each of the cattle the turnips into the feeding trough of each.\n\nTo prevent any of the cattle from choking on small turnips, or pieces of large ones, as they are very apt to do, the chains at the stakes are contrived of such a length, that no ox can raise his head too high when eating; for, in this way, it is observed, cattle are generally choked. However, in case it still should happen, that an ox chokes on a turnip, the cattle-man, or feeder is provided with a ramrod, made of a piece of strong stiff rope, with a small round polished wooden head at the end of it; this he introduces into the mouth of the ox, and so gently knocks the turnip down his throat, without either difficulty or danger to the animal. That the cattle-feeder may be always at hand to attend his cattle, a small apartment with a window in it, in which his bed is placed, is constructed immediately off the corner of the byre, so that he is ready, even in the night-time, in case of any accident happening, to give assistance.\n\nAt the distance of about five feet eight inches from the feeding troughs, and parallel to them, is the dung groop and urine gutter, neatly and substantially built with hewn stone. Here, too, like the troughs, there is a gradual declivity from the inner and upper to the outer and lowest end; so that the moment the urine passes from the cattle, it runs to the lowest end of the gutter, whence it is conveyed through the outer wall of the byre in a large stone spout, and deposited in the urinarium outside of the wall. At this place is a large inclosed space, occupied as a compost dung-court. Here, all sorts of stuff are collected for increasing the manure; such as, fat earth, cleanings of roads, ditches, ponds, &c., rotten vegetables, &c.; and the urine from the byre being caused to run over all these collected together, which is done very easily by a couple of wooden spouts moved backwards and forwards to the urinarium at pleasure, renders the whole mass in a short time, a rich compost dunghill; and this is done by the urine alone, which in general is totally lost. The dung of the byre again is cleaned out several times each day, at the two front doors of the byre opposite to the groop, and deposited in the dung-court; so that, in this way, too, the byre is kept in as good order as any stable, and the cattle as clean as horses. Along the edge of the dung-court, a few low sheds are constructed, in which young beefs, sheep, or swine, &c., are kept; and these consume the refuse and remains of the turnips from the great feeding byre.\n\nIn the side wall of the byre, and opposite to the heads of the cattle, there are constructed three vents, or ventilators; these are placed at the distance of about two feet four inches from the ground in the inside of the byre, and come out immediately under the casing of the slates on the outside. The inside openings of these are about 13 inches in length, seven in breadth, and nine in depth in the wall; and they serve two good purposes. 1. The breath of cattle being specifically lighter than atmospheric air; the consequence is, that, in some byres, the cattle are kept in a constant heat and sweat, because their breath and heat have no way to escape; whereas, by means of the ventilators, the air of the byre is kept in proper circulation, which conduces as much to the health of the cattle as to the preservation of the walls and timber of the byre, by drying up the moisture produced from the breath and sweat of the cattle, which is found to injure those parts of the building.\n\nThe method of giving cows their food by the milk-farmers in the vicinity of the metropolis, where this business is carried on upon the most extensive scale, is thus stated in the valuable Agricultural Survey of that district. \"During the night, the cows are confined in stalls; about three o'clock in the morning, each cow has a half-bushel basket of grains; when the milking is finished, a bushel basket of turnips is given to each cow; and very soon afterwards they have an allotment in the proportion of one bushel to ten cows, of the most grassy and soft meadow hay, which had been the most early mown, and cured of the greenest colour. These several feedings are generally made before eight o'clock in the morning, at which time the cows are turned into the cow-yard. About twelve o'clock they are again confined to their stalls, and served with the same quantity as they had in the morning. When the afternoon milking, which continues till near three, is finished, the cows are again served with the same quantity of turnips, and about an hour afterwards with the same distribution of hay, as before described. This mode of feeding generally continues during the turnip season, which is from the month of September to the month of May. During the other months of the year they are fed with grains, cabbages, tares, and the other foregoing proportion of second cut meadow hay, and are continued to be fed with the same regularity until they are turned out to graze, when they continue in the field all night; and even during this season they are frequently fed with grains.\"\n\nAs the grains employed in feeding cattle cannot always be procured fresh as they are wanted, it becomes a desirable object to preserve them for a length of time. They are preserved in some places by putting them into pits dug in the earth, into which they are trodden down, and afterwards covered to a moderate depth with dry earth. In this way being defended from the action of the air, and thus prevented from fermenting, they may be kept for a considerable time during the months of summer, when brewing is not carrying on; they may also be kept by placing them down into casks placed upon stands, so as to elevate them a little from the ground, and having their bottoms pierced with holes, to carry off the superabundant moisture.\n\nFood of Dogs.\n\nA good feeder is very essential. He should be of young, active, industrious, and good tempered, for the sake of the animals entrusted to his care, who, however they may be treated by him, cannot complain. He must strictly obey any orders that his master may give, both\nWe must however remark, that barley meal should never be given by itself to hunting hounds during the hunting season, as its heating quality renders them exceedingly thirsty; and when out, they take every opportunity to lap water.\n\nThe meat should never be given to the dogs too hot, and should be mixed up to as thick a consistency as may be. The feeding troughs should be wide at the bottom, and have wooden covers, and they should not be made too long; five or six troughs that are easily moved, are better than two or three that are unwieldy.\n\nThe boiling for the hounds, mixing of the meat, and preparing it for them at proper hours, will of course be taken care of by the huntman. He must constantly attend the feeding of the hounds, who should be draughted according to the state they are in at the time. Some hounds are better feeders than others, and some require less meat than others; a nice eye and great attention are required to keep them all in equal flesh. This is what constitutes the merit of the huntman, and shews him to be well qualified for his office; but few are sufficiently attentive to this. The hounds are fed in a hurry, without examining them before they begin. To ascertain properly the condition of a pack of hounds requires no small circumspection.\n\nThe huntman should call each hound by name, letting him in to his food as he is called; this uses them to their name, and teaches them obedience. A hound should always approach him who calls on him; and if he touches him with a stick, he should follow wherever he is led.\n\nThe thin and tender feeding hounds being first turned out to the feeding room, will have the opportunity of picking where they choose. Such hounds as are in low condition, had better be drafted off into a separate kennel. Thus selecting those that are poor, we proceed to the feeding of the rest with less trouble and more accuracy; but those that are drafted off, when more flesh is mixed with the meat, must be let in to feed one by one as they answer to their names; or they may be better fed than taught. Thus the hounds who want flesh, will all have a share of it; and if any of them be much poorer than the rest, they should be fed again, as such hounds cannot be fed too often. Unless peculiarly good, a soft waxy constituted hound will scarcely ever be worth the attention that is given him; and after a hard day is frequently unserviceable for some time. It must be recollected, however, that such hounds as are tender, or lean feeders, cannot be fed too late, or with too rich meat. Should any hounds appear to get too fat, they must not be suffered to eat their fill, but the rest may eat as much of the meat as they please.\n\nOnce a week, or fortnight at most, during the hunting season, the hounds should have a pound of sulphur given them in their meat; and when the season is over, they should have half a pound of antimony added to the sulphur, and well mixed with the meat. On these days, the hounds should all be let in to feed together, and such as require flesh, have it given to them afterwards. Greens boiled in their meat once a week, is likewise proper. A horse killed and given to hounds whilst warm, after a very hard day's hunting, will make an excellent meal, but they should not hunt again till three days after it. The bones broken are good food for poor hounds, as there is considerable nourishment in them.\nSheeps trotters are also very sweet food, and in a scarcity of horse flesh, bullocks paunches may be employed with advantage.\n\nIt is customary with some to shut up the hounds for two hours after they have returned from hunting, before they are fed, and the other hounds are shut up with them to lick them clean; but probably this practice does more harm than good, as the idle hounds will disturb the tired dogs more by their licking, than this will make amends for. Besides, hounds shut up on their return from hunting, will not afterwards readily quit their benches, as, if much fatigued, they will seek repose rather than food. It is therefore a better way when the hunt is nearly over, to send forward a servant to see the meat prepared, that the dogs may be fed immediately on their return. If they have had a fever day, they should be fed again afterwards. When hounds are fed twice, they should be kept separate from the hounds that were left at home, till after the second feeding, and it will be still better if they are not put together till the next morning. It is the best plan to feed the hounds that have been out twice. Some hounds will feed better the second time than the first, and besides, the turning them out from the lodging house refreshes them, and allows them to stretch their limbs; and if the kennel is cleaned out, and the litter well shaken up, they will afterwards settle themselves better on their benches. It is at all times proper, after feeding, to turn out the dogs into the grass court, as this contributes very much to the cleanliness of the kennel.\n\n**Chap. III. Of Exercise.**\n\nNature dictates the necessity of exercise to almost every animal, and a greater or less proportion of it is necessary to enable them to perform their functions with health and activity. The proportion requisite for this purpose is, however, not the same in all animals. Sheep and cattle require but little exercise, much of which, indeed, appears to be incompatible with the manner of their eating; for, as they require a second mastication of their food by rumination, a considerable time is necessary for this process, which cannot be properly performed, unless the animal be entirely at its ease. It is found, however, that such of these animals as are kept without exercise, or are wholly cooped up in houses, for the purpose of fattening them more speedily, are neither so healthy, nor afford such fine and wholesome meat, as those which are permitted to rove at large in their native pastures. It is to the horse and dog that exercise seems the most essential. These animals require the greatest proportion, and are most injured by the want of it. The observations we are about to make will chiefly apply to the horse.\n\nSuch horses as are constantly employed in active labour have, of course, sufficient exercise; but it often happens that those which are kept by gentlemen, for their pleasure or convenience, are, when their labour is not required, permitted to stand whole days in the stable, without any other exercise than being ridden perhaps twice a day to a neighbouring pond. In cities and large towns, even this exercise is often not permitted them. They are in the mean time plentifully fed with rich, hard food, and thus pampered, they are rendered liable to the attacks of many acute diseases; and when their exertions are required, they cannot perform their usual labour with their usual ease. It is therefore necessary that such horses as are not regularly worked should receive daily a moderate proportion of exercise, and should be accustomed to such a degree of labour as may counterbalance the effect of high feeding, and enable them to undergo occasional exertion. A horse who is kept in the state of regular leisure is said to be in wind. The exercise of a horse that is not constantly worked should not, however, be excessive, or be carried beyond the commencement of fatigue, as this would wear out the horse without necessity. It is an absurd practice which some people pursue, to send out their horses every day to be galloped and rattled along the roads, or perhaps over the streets, for the purpose of keeping them in wind. This is wrong, even where the horse is in good health and sound condition; but when it is practised with finew-strained, or founded horses, as is not uncommon, it must be productive of considerable mischief.\n\nIn general, two hours a-day will be sufficient for the purpose of preserving the health of the horse, and this may be taken at once or twice in the day, as may be most convenient. If possible, the owner should ride his own horse in these exercising jaunts, for the groom will probably do the horse more injury than benefit.\n\nSome horses require more exercise than others. Gentlemen's horses that are merely kept for light riding, will do with but little; but hunters and racers require a greater proportion, and should seldom have less than three hours a-day. This, however, must depend in a great measure on the quantity and quality of their food, as the food and exercise must in general be proportioned to each other; but in all cases care must be taken that the horse's labour do not exceed his strength. Young horses are not equal to much exertion, and should therefore be exercised but lightly. Many horses have been destroyed by the neglect of this precaution, especially in the army, where it is not unusual to receive horses as recruits of four or even three years of age. These horses, when they reach the regiment, to which they are probably brought from a considerable distance, are in general weak and in low condition, and are probably suffering from some acute disease, brought on them by exposure to cold and wet during their journey. They are of course very unfit for labour, and require at least three or four weeks' rest, before they can with propriety be brought to go through their exercises in the riding school. According to Mr. White, however, they are seldom allowed the half of that time, but are brought too hastily into the school, without reflecting that, as they are unaccustomed to such exercises, or indeed at that early age to any kind of work, it must become exceedingly fatiguing to them; and to young horses in a state of debility, especially if they are not immediately attended to, when brought sweating from the riding school, such labour must often be followed by the worst consequences.\n\nWhere a horse cannot be conveniently taken out to the fields or roads, for the purpose of exercise, expedients have been thought on to exercise them within the stable, or in a yard adjoining. The stable can answer for this purpose only when it is very large, and he may then be made to trot backwards and forwards\ntill he begins to sweat, with some advantage. We have heard of the governor of a certain town, who fell on a good expedient to exercise the horses of a large body of cavalry that had been received into the town, just before the enemy laid siege to it. As there was no possibility of riding out the horses, he caused a number of the troopers to stand about the horses, two or three at each horse, and whip them so as to make them fly from one side of the stall to the other, till both men and horses were sufficiently heated. It is said that by this means the horses were kept in a pretty good state of health, whereas they would otherwise have been much diseased.\n\nWhen a horse comes in from work in a profuse perspiration, he should not be suffered to stand to cool at the stable door, but should rather be walked gently about, if the weather will permit of it, or else be tied up in his stall with a cloth thrown over him. If he is in a violent sweat, it is a good practice to stroke off the sweat with a sharp-edged stick, as is usually performed on race-horses immediately after running the course. If he is much fatigued, it will also be not amiss to give him a little strong beer, a small draught of which will considerably refresh him. The French commonly give wine in these cases; but their wine is very weak, and is probably not so wholesome for horses as our ale.\n\nIt is very common with the drivers of coaches, and many grooms, to throw cold water over the legs of horses, when they come to the end of their journey, sweating and fatigued. Some even ride them into the water on these occasions, or throw it over a great part of their body. This is a very dangerous practice, and gives occasion to several diseases of the legs, joints, and feet. It is more especially to be avoided when the horse has been long sweating, as when in this state he is too much weakened to bear the shock of the cold water with impunity. When a horse is overheated without much sweating or fatigue, the practice would probably not be attended with danger, and bathing him with cold water at that time would perhaps be even beneficial, especially if he were immediately rubbed dry, and covered with a light cloth. But as it is difficult to hit this nice point, this practice must be employed with caution, and should never be trusted to the indiscriminate prudence of a groom or coachman. The instances of horses having been plunged into cold water when overheated, without sustaining any injury, are easily explained from the above remark.\n\nM. Lafoffe makes the following remarks on the exercise of horses. \"A horse on a journey may travel five hours at a time, if not hurried onwards; a manege horse one hour; a cavalry horse may manoeuvre two hours; a coach horse, at a slow pace, six hours. But it is proper that saddle horses should not be overloaded, and that the load of a horse in harness should be in proportion to his strength, in order to perform those proportions of labour, to establish which is a difficult point; all depends on quickness. We will say generally, that a saddle horse, well formed, and muscular, may thus carry at a slow rate, two-thirds of his own weight, and run in a chair, with double and one-half of his weight. It is easy to see from this, that the load of a saddle horse should be less if he is put on the trot, and less still if he is made to gallop. The draught horse, on the contrary, lightens his load by speed; which, however, he cannot long continue without tiring, and being out of breath.\n\n\"The disorders which proceed from hard work are, founder, fret, and most inflammatory diseases. There are others that proceed from sudden transitions from heat to cold, or, on the contrary, such as inflammation of the lungs, colds, glanders, rheumatisms, and dropsy of the breast. These are particularly frequent and dangerous to cavalry horses. They have existed at all times; but the present system of manoeuvres renders them much more common than formerly; they are a species of endemic disorders, which alarm many regiments, and make them dread the consequences. But there can be no doubt they may be avoided in a great degree.\n\n1. By taking no horse into a regiment under four years old, and those only which are well formed.\n2. By giving them forage of good quality.\n3. By airing them in the stable, and\n4. By avoiding to put them in a sweat, which is a state contrary to nature. This forced perspiration dries up and impoverishes the blood, spoils the finer fibres, the vessels lose their reaction; hence the stagnation of the humours, which produce tumours and farcy. It would be advisable then to avoid accidents after a repetition of military exercises by walking the horses quick, and afterwards slowly, until they have regained their natural warmth. By this means a repercussion of the humours may be avoided. For the same reason, a horse should neither be watered, fed, or dressed while sweating; on the contrary, if he must be put into the stable, take off the saddle, rub him down with straw, and cover him with a cloth.\"\n\nPART V. VETERINARY MATERIA MEDICA.\n\nIN treating of the substances employed in the cure of the diseases that affect domestic animals, we shall first describe the usual forms in which they are administered, with the most approved methods of exhibiting each, in the various cases to which they are applicable. We shall then enumerate the remedies themselves, arranged under certain heads or classes, as is usually done by writers on the materia medica; for the sake of bringing together under one view, those articles which are suited to the same purposes. We shall not at present, however, describe the articles made use of, as most of them are employed in general medicine, and a particular account will be given of them in the article Materia Medica. Our object here will be to point out the doses required for the animals of whose diseases we are about to treat; and the particular cases to which they are adapted. To each class we shall subjoin a number of receipts to which we shall have occasion to refer, when we come to the treatment of the diseases.\nThe most usual forms in which medicine is exhibited, to horses and cattle, are those of powder, ball, drench, ointment, poultice, and fomentation.\n\n**Powders.**\n\nThere are not many substances which admit of being administered in the form of powders; for as it is necessary to mix these with the food of the animal, they must of course be composed of such articles as do not impair to the food any very strong or disagreeable taste. The substances chiefly given in the form of powders are antimony, sulphur, nitre, and some of the aromatic seeds, &c. They should be reduced to the finest powder, and should be thoroughly mixed with the corn or bran that is placed before the animal. Those powders which do not readily dissolve in water, such as antimony, sulphur, and the powder of seeds, should be moistened before mixing with the food, as in this way less of the medicine will be wasted. Emetic tartar, and all articles that require to be given in a small determinate dose, cannot properly be administered in this form.\n\nIn giving powders mixed with the food of horses, much will depend on the delicacy of the animal's taste, and on the state of his stomach at the time. Some horses will readily take their food mixed with medicinal powders, while others refuse every article offered to them in this form. When this is the case, or when the medicine thus administered appears to disagree with the animal's stomach, this mode of giving it must not be repeated; but the medicine must be administered in some other form.\n\nPowders are also sometimes used externally either to sores and ulcers, or blown into the eyes.\n\n**Balls.**\n\nThe form of ball or bolus is one of the most common in which internal medicines are administered in farriery. It is extremely convenient, as there are very few articles that do not admit of being given when mixed up into a ball; as they are, from the peculiar conformation of the animal's throat, more easily administered than any other form that can be given by the mouth. Some articles, however, especially such as easily evaporate at the usual temperature of the air, as ether and volatile alkali, and such as speedily liquefy or deliquesce by exposure to a moist atmosphere, are not so properly given in the form of balls. Substances, too, which require a very large dose, do not easily admit of this form, and are best given in infusion, or mixed with water in the form of a drench.\n\nIt is best to prepare balls as they are required, or at least not many days before they are needed, as by exposure to the air they become hard, and do not easily dissolve in the stomach; they may even pass through the bowels nearly unchanged. But what is of still more consequence, giving a hard ball may endanger the animal's life, by its sticking in his throat. Mr White says, that he has known several instances of horses being destroyed in this way. Sometimes the horse's jaws are so narrow as not to admit of introducing the hand between them. In this case, the ball may be fixed lightly on the end of a stick or cane, moderately pointed; or, what is still better, placed loosely in a kind of cup fixed on such a stick or cane; and thus thrust to the back of the tongue.\n\nThe ball should be made not round, but nearly of the shape of an egg, and rather less in size. The mode of administering balls to horses requires some dexterity. To give a ball with ease, the operator should extend his fingers so as to surround one end of it, while the whole hand and the thumb opposite to the finger that surround the ball must be contracted into as small a space as possible, as the smaller the hand, the greater will be the ease with which the operation is performed, both to the farrier and the horse. The animal's mouth is usually kept open by means of an instrument called a balling iron, that is formed like a ring, with an opening sufficiently large to admit the hand, and which is covered with cloth, and placed between the horse's jaws; thus preventing him from shutting his mouth, or hurting the operator with his teeth. When the ball is held in this way, in the right hand, the tongue of the animal is to be drawn out with the left hand towards the left side, and the ball is to be adroitly placed beyond the root of the tongue, and immediately on quitting the ball, the tongue is to be let go, and the horse allowed to raise his head. The ball is now in such a situation that it cannot be thrown back, and will be gradually swallowed. In holding the tongue, it is proper to keep it pretty firmly against the lower jaw, as this position greatly facilitates the operation. Balls are usually wrapped up tightly in paper, to prevent their disagreeable taste, but the paper should be very thin and delicate, that it may easily give way when the ball enters the stomach. Wafer paper, which is employed for administering boluses in the human subject, would be an improvement in farriery, which may be easily adopted, as it is by no means expensive.\n\nWhen the balls are composed of very hot or stimulating ingredients, it is proper to give the horse drink before administering them. It is best to give the drink first, as horses in particular will not readily drink after receiving a ball. If the ball has been composed of any medicine that possesses a corrosive quality, or is otherwise very irritating, as arsenic, corrosive sublimate, blue vitriol, or the like, it is necessary to give the animal, previous to the operation, a considerable quantity of some mucilaginous drink, as of water-gruel, or linseed tea.\n\nWhen a ball is properly administered, it gives the animal very little fatigue, and may be repeated much more frequently than any other form of medicine. It is therefore extremely convenient.\n\nThe ingredients composing a ball should be mixed up with some fugitive substance, as molasses, honey, or extract of liquorice softened in water, rather than with any gummy or mucilaginous substance, as these latter soon become hard by exposure to the air.\n\nWhen a number of balls of the same kind are made at once, great care should be taken in mixing the ingredients in the most accurate manner, otherwise a much greater quantity of the active part of the medicine will be found in some of the balls than in others.\n\nThough we have mentioned the use of the balling iron, in administering balls to horses, some grooms and farriers are very expert in giving the ball without this instrument.","sp":59,"ep":78},{"h":"FARRIERY","t":"7. Sialogogues.\n\nThese remedies are given with a view of increasing the flow of saliva or slaver.

STIMULANTS.\n\nThese are such remedies as are suited to increase the action, either of the whole circulating system, or of some particular part or organ. They are at present usually divided into diffusible and permanent, the former being such as produce a considerable stimulating effect, which is soon followed by a degree of quietness or torpor, proportioned to the quantity that had been administered; as wine, alcohol, ether, and probably opium; the other sort being such as produce no very considerable effect, unless repeatedly exhibited for some considerable time.\n\nMost of the stimulants are called cordials or aromatics; and under this class, we rank those medicines which have been called carminatives, or which are calculated to expel wind from the stomach and bowels, epiphanics or blistering substances; and under this class we may also reckon most of those remedies that are called alteratives, or such as are supposed to produce some change in the constitution or habit of body. The stimulating remedies employed in farriery, as in human medicine, are very numerous.\n\na. AMMONIA, or Volatile Alkali. Prepared Ammonia. Carbonate of Ammonia.\nDose from half a drachm to two drachms, in a ball newly prepared. In the latter stages of fever, attended with great debility.\n\nb. Spirit of Sal Ammoniac. Water of Carbonate of Ammonia.\nChiefly used externally.\nCaustic Volatile Alkali. Water of Ammonia.\nUsed externally mixed with oil into a liniment, in cases of strains, bruises and swellings of the back finesse.\n\nc. ANISESEED. *Pimpinella anisum*. Lin.\nThe seed in powder. Dose about an ounce, in a ball.\n\nd. BALSAM\nd. Balsam of Copaiva. See Expectorants.\n\nIn flatulent colic or gripes.\n\ne. Barbados Tar.\n\nExternally mixed with oil of turpentine or sweet oil into an embrocation. In strains and bruises.\n\nf. Cantharides, or Spanish fly. Lytta vesicatoria.\n\nTincture of cantharides. Externally by way of embrocation in similar cases.\n\nBlisters are well known to be those remedies that irritate the skin to which they are applied, so as to raise the scarf-skin into a bladder containing a watery fluid, which is the serous part of the blood. By abstracting this from the general mass of circulation, they produce an evacuation, proportioned to their extent, from the part to which they are applied, and are thus extremely useful in producing a determination of blood from some neighbouring and more important part.\n\nBlisters are of considerable use in veterinary practice. According to Mr White they are very efficacious in dispersing callous swellings, the effects of strains, bruises, &c. Their beneficial effects are very great in removing the inflammation of such parts as are remote from the surface. In inflammations of the internal parts of the foot, they generally give relief when applied to the part, especially if the auxiliary remedies are not neglected, such as raising the hoof, paring the sole, soaking the horny part of the foot in warm water, or by the application of a poultice to it, and administering a purging medicine. For curbs, wind-galls, spasms, &c., no remedy is more efficacious than blistering. It is also productive of salutary effects in inflammation of the internal organs. For instance, when the lungs are inflamed, the determination of blood to the diseased part is lessened by extensive blistering of the sides, and considerable relief is afforded in this way.\n\nBy the unskilful treatment of broken knees, a callous swelling is often left in the part, for the removal of which it is always necessary to have recourse to blistering. If blisters are freed from all caustic ingredients, and properly made, no injury to the hair will result from their application; and if one should fail of producing the desired effect, the practice may be followed without danger till that object is attained.\n\ng. Blue Vitriol. Sulphate of Copper.\n\nEmployed externally to foul ulcers, either in solution, or by touching their edges with a crystal of it; to produce healthy granulations.

Corrosive Sublimate. Muriate of Mercury.\n\nEmployed internally in solution, in doses of about 15 grains, gradually increased. In farcy and glanders. Externally by way of lotion, to foul ulcers and eruptions of the skin.\n\nNo preparation of mercury seems to produce so great a degree of weakness in the horse as this. Its effects must therefore be carefully watched; and besides the regulations laid down above; the horse must be kept on a more nourishing diet than usual.\n\nx. Red Precipitate.

Antispasmodics.\n\nThere are such remedies as are calculated to remove spasmodic affections of the muscles, or convulsive affections, and are therefore frequently employed in cases of locked jaw, epilepsy, &c. Few remedies of this class are used in veterinary practice. Such as are more peculiarly of this nature are mentioned below. They generally consist of stimulants or of anodyne remedies.\n\na. Camphor.\nDose, about two drachms, in a ball combined with opium and stimulants. In locked jaw.\n\nb. Ether. Sulphuric Ether.\nOne of the most powerful antispasmodics.\nDose, about an ounce, mixed with a pint of water.

Anodynes\n\nAre those remedies which are given for the purpose of procuring sleep, or alleviating pain. They are commonly called narcotics, and many of them are by most medical writers denominated sedatives.\n\na. Fox-Glove. Digitalis purpurea. Lin.\nThe leaves in powder.\nDose, half a drachm, increased gradually according to its effect. In violent internal inflammations and swelling of the legs.\n\nb. Hemlock. Conium maculatum.

Hop. Humulus lupulus. Lin.\nThe dried cones in powder.\n\nDose a drachm or two, in a ball.\n\nThe hop has been shewn to be a powerful narcotic, and has succeeded in producing sleep in some cases where opium has failed. It has not yet been introduced into veterinary practice; but we think it deserves a trial, as being much cheaper than opium.\n\ne. Opium.\nDose, about a drachm by the mouth, and two drachms in a clyster.\n\nf. Poppy. Papaver somniferum. Lin.\nThe dried heads boiled in water, by way of fomentation.\n\nReceipts.\n\n53.

Take of extract of hemlock, two drachms;\n   Peppermint water, half a pint;\n   Ether, half an ounce.\n   Dissolve the extract in the water, and add the ether at the moment of exhibition.\n   For a drench.\n   In putrid fever, or gangrene.\n\n57. Take of bruised poppyheads, four ounces;\n   Hemlock leaves green, a large handful.\n   Boil gently in a gallon of water for about an hour, and strain the decoction.\n   In wounds and bruises attended with considerable irritability.\n\n15. Worm Medicines.\n\nThere are few cases in which worm medicines are given in veterinary practice. In the horse they are seldom required, and do not often prove effectual. In the dog, indeed, they have been employed more frequently, and may be used with more probability of success. The remedies of this class are generally of two kinds, either such as are violent purgatives, and in this way expel the worms by the violence of their operation; or, they are such as act mechanically on these animals, irritating and tearing their tender bodies, and thus forcing them to relinquish their situation.\n\na. Castor Oil.\nDose, about half a pound.\n\nb. Gamboge.\nDose, two or three drachms in a ball.\n\nc. Mercury. Calomel.\nDose, for a horse, two or three drachms; for a dog, about half a drachm, in a ball with purgatives.\n\nd. Salt.\nDose, from four to six ounces, in a drench, or double the quantity by way of clyster.\n\nSaid to have proved frequently successful in expelling worms, when followed by a brisk purgative.\n\ne. Sal Indus.\nA salt lately procured from the East Indies, said to be successful in expelling bots from horses; but Mr White thinks that other worms have been mistaken for bots, in the cases where it has been successful.\nDose, about four or five ounces in a drench.\n\nf. Tin. Powder of Tin.\nDose, about an ounce, mixed with honey.\nThis promises to be one of the most effectual medicines in cases of tape-worm, that are so common to dogs.\n\nReceipts.\n\n58. Take of calomel, jalap, each half a drachm;\nHoney enough to make a ball.\nFor dogs.\n\n59. Take of tin powder,\nQuicksilver, of each two drachms.\nGrind together till they be thoroughly mixed; then add enough of sugar to form a powder, to be made up into a ball with catile soap, softened with water.\n\n60. Take of sal indus, four ounces;\nAlum, half an ounce;\nWater, a pint.\nDissolve for a drench. For the botts in horses.\n\n16. Chemical Remedies.\n\nMany remedies are given internally, or applied externally, which seem to act merely chemically, either by combining with an acid or alkali, and thus neutralizing it, by checking putrefaction, or correcting the ill smell that is produced by it; or, in external applications, by destroying or corroding the parts to which they are applied. This class will therefore comprehend,\n\n1. All those medicines that have been called antacids or absorbents, which are given to correct acidity in the stomach and bowels.\n\n2. Antalkalines, or those acid substances that are given more rarely to correct alkalinefence.\n\n3. Antiseptics, or those that are supposed capable of obviating putrefaction.\n\n4. Caustics or escharotics, which are intended to corrode the skin, or to take down fungous or proud flesh in ulcers.\n\na. Alum.\nBurnt Alum.\nSometimes applied to ulcers, to wear down proud flesh.\n\nb. Ammonia.\nSpirit of Sal Ammoniac. Water of Ammonia.\nDose, a drachm or two, in a drench, for acidity in the stomach and bowels.\n\nc. Antimony.\nButter of Antimony. Muriate of Antimony.\nSometimes applied to foul ulcers. A violent caustic.\n\nd. Charcoal.\n\nGiven internally in powder, to correct the bad smell in violent purging; and when powdered fine, may be sprinkled on large flanking fores, with the same intention.\n\ne. Lime.\nLime-water. Dose about a quart, in acidity of the stomach.\n\nf. Chalk.\nCarbonate of Lime.\nDose, an ounce or two.\nIn violent purging attended with acidity.\n\ng. Silver.\nLunar Caustic. Nitrate of Silver.\nEmployed to eat down proud flesh, or destroy horrid excrescences.\n\nh. Spirit of Salt. Dose about two drachms, mixed with a quart of water by way of drench.\n\ni. Vinegar.\nGiven internally as an antiseptic, diluted with an equal quantity of water, or used externally to wash foul ulcers.\n\nk. Vitriolic Acid.\nDose, a drachm or two, as under spirit of salt.\n\nl. Yeast or Barm.\nEmployed to make fermenting poultices in cases of flinking ulcers.\n\nReceipts.\n\n61.

Take of aquafortis, an ounce;\nFilings of copper, half an ounce.\nDissolve in a gentle heat, taking care to avoid the fumes.\nFor a caustic, in canker of the foot. It may be made into an ointment for the same purpose, by mixing with hog's lard.\n\n66.

Take of corrosive sublimate, half a drachm;\n    Ardent spirits, two ounces.\n    Dissolve for a lotion.\n    Useful as an application to the callous edges of ulcers.\n\n17. MISCELLANEOUS REMEDIES.\n\na. EGGS. The Yolk.\n   Sometimes employed among the common farriers as a remedy for broken wind, but appear to be useful only for the purpose of combining oily substances with water.\n\nb. ELECAMPO. Enula helenium, Lin.\n   The root in powder. In the form of ointment for the itch or mange.\n\nc. GLASS.\n   Powdered glass is sometimes blown into the eyes of horses, to remove specks on the cornea.\n\nd. LEAD.\n   White Lead.

Take of sulphur vivum powdered, four ounces;\n    Salt butter, six ounces;\n    Train oil,\n    Oil of turpentine, each one ounce.\n    Mix well together into an ointment.\n    These two ointments are useful applications in the mange.\n\n70. Take of hogs lard, four ounces;\n    Tar, two ounces.\n    Melt together into an ointment.\n    Employed to anoint the backs of sheep or cattle, when bitten by the gad-fly.\n\n71. Take of burgundy pitch, four ounces;\n    Barbadoes tar, six ounces;\n    Bees wax, two ounces;\n    Red lead, four ounces.\n    Melt the pitch, tar, and wax together, and when the mixture is nearly cold, stir in the red lead, and continue stirring till it is firm.\n    This is Mr White's receipt for making charges, or strengthening plasters.\n    In cases of wind-galls and old strains.\n\nBefore concluding this part, it will be proper to make a few observations, on the custom that prevails to much among grooms and farriers, of administering medicine to horses, by way of preservatives of health, or preventives of disease. It is very common among these gentlemen to give men to bleed or physic a horse at least twice a-year, viz., in the spring and fall, though he be in never such good health, or good condition; to give him sulphur and antimony now and then to keep his coat fine; and to administer a cordial ball, or a dose of diaphoretics occasionally to improve his appetite. If he is to undergo any unusual exertion, as riding or hunting, it is judged necessary by these sagacious practitioners to prepare him for the work, by bleeding, purging, and sweating below a load of body clothes in a clole, hot stable. In pursuing this custom, they indeed only imitate what they practice on themselves on similar occasions. As they deem it necessary to have themselves bled every spring and fall, or once a quarter, to take physic once a month, and to sweat themselves to make them ride or run more lightly in a jockey match, they naturally conclude that their horses should be treated in the same manner, and should undergo the same preparation.\n\nIf an animal is in a perfect state of health, nothing more is required to render him capable of performing the functions for which he is intended. It is only when there appears some derangement of the system, or when the state of the body is such as to threaten the attack of some dangerous disease, that it is necessary to call in the assistance of medicine. We shall soon have occasion to mention cases of this kind, and to show how the threatened danger is to be avoided. It must be remembered that those substances that are called medicines, are such as produce some effect on the body, that is in general either unnatural, or is greater than what commonly takes place in a state of perfect health. If then we give medicines to an animal in this healthy state, we either excite the organs to some unusual exertion, or we check those exertions that are natural and healthy; and in either case, we must do harm. Besides the custom of giving medicines when they are unnecessary, renders them less efficacious when they are absolutely required, to ward off or obviate any disease. It is found that most remedies, when employed habitually, require to be increased in quantity in order to produce the same effect, and if continued too long they sometimes cease to produce their effect at all. With respect to some remedies, it is found that their habitual use is attended with dangerous consequences. Frequent bleeding tends to produce fatness, and a plethoric state of the body; the frequent use of cordials and stimulants stimulates the circulation too much, and produces such a rigidity of the fibres, as lays the foundation of apoplexy, palsy, and other dangerous disorders. It is well known, too, that when the action of the stomach is too much excited by the habitual use of stimulants, it in time loses its tone, and becomes incapable of healthy digestion, unless roused by a greater quantity of its accustomed stimulus. It is therefore obvious that when an animal is in perfect health, all that is required to keep him so, is the proper regulation of diet, exercise, cleanliness, and other circumstances that have been mentioned in the fourth part of this article.\n\nWe cannot better illustrate the absurdity of the usual methods\nmethods of preparing horses for a race, than by the following case, which fell under the observation of Mr Clark of Edinburgh. \"Two military gentlemen betted their horses to run against each other on the sands of Leith for a considerable sum, and this was to take place three weeks after the bet. The horses were to be ridden by their own grooms. Captain R's was a poney about 13\u00bd hands, Captain M's was a gelding about 15 hands high. Both grooms were bred at Newmarket, and were keen advocates for bleeding and purging, though both the horses had been kept on dry food, and in the best order, and the interval of time for such treatment was very short. This bleeding and purging was in order to prepare them the better for running. Captain M's horse was bled once, and purged twice. Captain R's was bled once, and purged once. Both were sweated in the stable with a great load of clothes; and their stables, though separate, were kept uncommonly hot, and closely shut up day and night, though it was in the midst of summer. From this treatment the horses soon lost their appetite, and in the course of eight or ten days their strength was so much exhausted that they were scarcely able to go through their usual exercise on the sands. In this situation Captain R. considered his bet as lost, and expected nothing less than the loss of his poney, on which he felt a high value. Luckily, however, the groom, who was rather corpulent, had put himself under a course of physic, to bring himself down to the proper weight, and was unable to proceed in his plan of purging and sweating the horse. The poney was therefore provided with another groom, and was put under the care of Mr Clark, who, feeling the absurdity of the plan which had hitherto been observed, ordered his clothing to be reduced to a single rug, and the stable windows to be thrown open, to admit the fresh air. The poney soon recovered his appetite; and his activity, strength and spirits were in a great measure restored. Captain M's horse in the meantime was continued under the debilitating regimen. When the race came to be decided, though at starting the odds were considerably in favour of Captain M's horse, yet his opponent won the race with considerable ease.\n\nPART VI. OF THE DISEASES INCIDENT TO DOMESTIC ANIMALS.\n\nIN treating of the diseases of domestic animals; we shall class them in two great divisions: in the first of which we shall consider most of those morbid affections which are usually called local and symptomatic, or in general those simple affections of the several functions, that are most easily understood, and require the least complicated mode of treatment. In the second of these divisions we shall treat of the more complicated diseases, or those in which the whole system is more or less affected, and of which the treatment is more difficult, and in general more precarious.\n\nWhen an animal is diseased, he is affected with some or other of the following symptoms.\n\n1. Of Sensation.\n   He labours under too acute sensibility; or,\n   He is affected with pain or itching.\n   His sensibility is unusually diminished.\n   His sense of smelling is more or less impaired.\n   He hears with difficulty, or not at all.\n   His vision is more or less impaired.\n   He is unusually watchful.\n   His sleep is disturbed; or,\n   He is unusually heavy and drowsy.\n\n2. Of Motion.\n   He is either affected with irregular, involuntary motions or spasms; or,\n   His moving powers are impaired.\n\n3. Of Digestion.\n   His digestive organs perform their functions too quickly.\n   His digestion is impaired; or,\n   He does not digest at all.\n   He is affected with sickness,\n   with flatulence, or wind in the stomach and bowels.\n\n4. Of Absorption.\n   He is unusually fat; or,\n   Unusually lean.\n   He is affected with some watery swelling.\n\n5. Of Circulation.\n   His circulation is too rapid; or,\n   It is too slow; or,\n   It is irregular.\n   He has some effusion of blood.\n\n6. Of Respiration.\n   His breathing is hurried; or,\n   It is difficult.\n   He is affected with cough;\n   with sneezing,\n   hiccup.\n   His breath is hot; or,\n   It is cold.\n   His skin is unusually hot; or,\n   It is unusually cold.\n\n7. Of Secretion and Excretion.\n   His secretions and excretions are either unusually copious.\n   He stales profusely.\n   He has a purging; or,\n   His skin is unusually moist.\n   The secretions and excretions are morbidly diminished.\n   He stales with difficulty, or not at all.\n   He is coltive.\n   His skin is unusually dry.\n\n8. Of\n8. Of Generation.\n\nHis venereal appetite is excessive; or,\nIt is morbidly impaired.\nHe is impotent.\n\nWhen a practitioner comes to examine one of these animals whose health is deranged, he will naturally inquire into all or most of the above particulars, and they will in general apply to all the four animals of which we are treating. There are some other questions which peculiarly relate to horses, and which it more especially becomes a farrier to ask; as, Whether his flanks work. Whether his ears are cold; or are in constant motion.\n\nIn what manner he walks.\nWhether he looks earnestly at his sides.\nWhether his eyes appear drowsy.\nIn what manner he carries his head.\nWhether he kicks his belly.\nWhether he appears devious to lie down, but afraid to do so.\nWhether he sometimes lies down on one side, and then immediately turns to the other.\nWhether he lies down and flies up again repeatedly.\nWhether he leans upon the manger.\nWhether he stands off from the manger.\nWhether he paws his litter.\nWhether his nose runs.\nWhether or not he passes much wind.\n\nIt will also frequently be of consequence to ascertain the following particulars.\n\nWhether the horse is usually in a poor condition.\nHow did the disorder begin?\nHow long has it continued?\nHow long is it since he ate or drank?\nHas he ever had the disorder before?\nIf he has, what was usually given him on these occasions?\nDoes the disorder come on at any particular times?\nHas he been observed to pass any worms?\nHow long he has been bought, and what price was paid for him.\nWas he bought of a horse-dealer, or of a private person?\nOf a friend, or at the public market?\n\nHaving ascertained the necessary particulars, it is proper to consider whether the disease is of such a nature as has in general been easily removed; or whether the expense and time of cure will be sufficiently compensated by the value of the horse; for it must be remarked, that in general a horse or other domestic animal is worth no more than the price he would fetch at the public market. Unless, therefore, the animal is a favorite, or has some particular good quality which greatly enhances his value, it may happen that the expense and trouble of cure may amount to more than the animal is worth. In such a case it would be both prudence and mercy to kill him, unless we wish to attempt his cure for the sake of experience. These observations of course equally apply to cases that are generally deemed incurable.\n\nHaving found that the disease is of such a nature as to give hopes of a speedy or perfect cure, it will next be proper for the practitioner to consider what is the speediest, safest, and cheapest method of treatment. In particular, he ought to consider whether any immediate remedy be necessary, in order to check the violence of the distemper; more especially whether any immediate evacuation is required, as bleeding, purging, blisters, rowels, &c.\n\nHe must also be particular in examining whether the disease be of a contagious or infectious nature, that the affected animals may be kept in a separate place from those which have not been attacked.\n\nAs the general nature and theory of disease will be considered at large under the medical department of this work, we have only in this article to detail the symptoms as they occur in the domestic animals; to point out the causes and seat of the disease, as far as they have been ascertained by observation and deduction; and to lay down the most approved methods of treatment adapted to these animals. Observations with respect to the theory of diseases would here be out of place, and we shall seldom hazard them, except in some of those specific complaints which appear to attack solely the animals of which we are treating.\n\nIt may not be improper to remark, that diseases, like the objects of natural history, have been arranged in two methods. One of these is the natural method, in which they are classified according to their seat or cause. The causes of diseases are the foundation of Dr. Darwin's system. In the first section of this part we shall attempt to classify the morbid symptoms according to their seat, or the functions which they attack. The other method of arrangement, or the artificial method, is that in which diseases are arranged according to some obvious and remarkable symptoms. This is best calculated for the purpose of recognizing the disease when seen, and is the method employed by most physicians. The diseases in the second section of this part will be arranged in this way.\n\nSECT. I.\n\nCHAP. I. Of Morbid Affections of Sensation.\n\nMost animals are occasionally subject to a morbid degree of sensibility, either of the whole nervous system, or of some particular organ. This morbid sensibility is generally called by medical writers, irritability; but this name is improper, as it implies an affection of the muscular parts; whereas the symptom we are now considering is an affection of the nervous system.\n\nSome horses naturally possess a morbid degree of sensibility, which appears by their starting on the sudden approach of any object, by the peculiar tenderness of their skin that makes them wince and tremble under the currycomb, and by the extreme sensibility that they evince at the least touch of the whip or spur. Such horses are in general very active and spirited; but they require a cautious and prudent rider, who must rather endeavour to soothe and encourage them, than use any harsh or violent means.\n\nThis increased sensibility is not easily removed by art,\nbut generally decreases as the horse grows older. It is best counteracted by living in a large well-aired stable, by being kept on hard coarse food, and by lying with as little litter below him, as is sufficient to prevent him from injuring himself against the pavement of the stable. In dressing him the currycomb should not be too sharp, and should not be employed too freely.\n\nWhen excessive sensibility arises from a delicacy and weakness of habit, strengthening medicines will be of use, and cordials may occasionally be employed.\n\nThere is a symptom nearly allied to this, which sometimes appears. The animal affected gathers himself together, and brings his four legs as close as possible below him, and creeps as it were all on a heap. This symptom often attends nervous diseases, and fever affections of the bowels. It is generally considered as a sign of great danger, and is not unfrequently the forerunner of mortification.\n\nAt the commencement of several acute diseases, especially those of the brain, animals betray an unusual sensibility to the effects of light and sound. When this happens, the place where they are kept should be darkened, and they should be as little as possible disturbed with noise.\n\nThere is a peculiar restlessness and anxiety with which animals are sometimes affected. This is not unfrequently their only complaint, or at least we cannot perceive that they are affected with any obvious or well-marked disease, but it is most commonly a symptom attending violent disorders, especially of the inflammatory kind; and generally preceding the fatal termination of dangerous chronic diseases. Animals thus affected are continually moving about, and often lie down; if they are at liberty, they seek out the most sequestered and gloomy parts of the pasture, and frequently change their place: if they are tied up, they appear to listen to, or observe, every thing that passes round them; they are restlessly attentive to the various objects near them; but although their eyes appear fixed, and wide open, they do not steadfastly regard any object; they are perpetually turning from side to side, and if they feel pain in any part, they often turn their heads mournfully towards it, sometimes groaning or panting. If this state has continued long, the animals become still more restless, are perpetually shifting about, scraping with their feet and pawing the litter; their ears become cold, and their hairs bristle up.\n\nThese latter symptoms are considered as denoting great danger, especially when the animal looks steadfastly at his sides, or stares with his eyes without appearing to take particular notice of any object.\n\nWhen anxiety appears to be the only symptom, without any signs of inflammation or convulsive affection, it is generally a mark of nervous weakness, and requires cordial and strengthening remedies, nourishing diet, and gentle exercise without labour: but if it is a symptom of some violent disease, it can only be removed by the general treatment of that disease; and in this view, will come to be considered hereafter.\n\nAnimals are sometimes affected with dejection or loss of spirit. This is not unfrequently the attendant of fatigue brought on by excessive labour or unusual exertion; and is therefore most commonly seen in horses. It appears by the animal's leaning his head on the manger, standing still in the same place, and appearing to move with pain or difficulty. His limbs are stiff, his skin hard and dry, his eyes look sad, he has no appetite for meat; if he lies down, he remains immovable, or if obliged to rise, immediately falls again when left to himself.\n\nIn general, if the fatigue produced be not extremely great, it gradually goes off with rest and quiet, especially if it has been found practicable to employ the means that are presently to be recommended; but if the exertion to which the animal was exposed, has been too great for its strength, the consequent depression may prove highly dangerous, or even fatal. In this state his urine is crude and watery, and, if a male horse, he seems scarcely to have the power of drawing for the purpose of making water; and his excrements are dry and scanty. If taken out in this condition he moves with pain and difficulty, trots slowly, or lifts his feet very little above the ground, carries his head very low and his ears depressed over his forehead; he often flinches, and not unfrequently falls on his knees, and appears very little sensible of the whip or spur. If a horse in this state has any sores or ulcers about him, they become hard, or flabby, assume a dull appearance, and the matter proceeding from them becomes thick and viscid. Rowels very frequently dry up; and if he is affected with any eruption of the skin, this commonly disappears.\n\nTo prevent the bad consequences that are likely to follow the state which we have now described, it is proper, as soon as we find a horse much fatigued, to spread a bed of litter for him to rest on; and as soon as possible give him a cordial bath, or drench. The strength of this must not, however, be in proportion to the degree of fatigue or depression; as experience has shown, that when a powerful cordial is given in a state of excessive weakness, it proves too much for the animal, and frequently excites fevers or inflammation. The horse's limbs should be bathed with warm water, and then rubbed thoroughly dry. After this he should be left to his repose, and if it be not too late at night, he may in a few hours have a warm bran mash. When a little recovered, he must be gently rubbed all over, but especially his limbs, without currying; he should be put upon a nourishing diet, and exercised but little. These means, varied according to circumstances, will in general bring the horse round, unless the symptoms are extremely violent; when they will commonly terminate in fever, or in some chronic disease, especially dropsy.\n\nThe train of symptoms which we have been describing, are most commonly the effect of fatigue; but they may arise from other causes. They are more or less the attendants of decay, and they are generally the forerunners of fever or inflammation of the brain.\n\nSometimes these animals are affected with a great degree of infirmity or torpor; they are heavy and listless; lie much; are not easily disturbed; are inattentive to the objects around them; seem to be insensible to pain, and move heavily and unwillingly. These symptoms require particular attention, as in most cases they denote some dangerous affection of the brain, and are very commonly followed by apoplexy or staggers; or by epilepsy; or they are the attendants (especially in sheep) of water in the head. Wherever they are observed to take place in an animal that has been full fed, with little exercise, especially if he appear fat and full\nDiseases of blood, and the pulse be found full and strong, the eyes red or heavy, there is danger of apoplexy; and the animal should immediately be bled and purged, be gradually put on a lower diet, and use gradually more exercise. These changes must be made by degrees, because too sudden changes may produce the very effects against which we are guarding.\n\nA great degree of torpor and insensibility is often produced by excessive cold, or by being kept long in an impure atmosphere. Where they have taken place from either of these causes to a dangerous degree, the application of heat must not be too sudden, as it will tend to extinguish the small remaining spark of life, and produce apoplexy, or mortification, where any external part has suffered from cold.\n\nThe head may be affected with dizzinesses, or giddinesses, commonly called turn-flick, from various causes. It may arise from great weakness, or it may be the consequence of plethoria, or fullness of blood. In the latter case, it is a pretty sure mark of approaching apoplexy or staggers; and the animal must immediately be bled, and put on a lower diet, with gentle exercise. In sheep, dizzinesses is a common symptom of flurdy, or water in the head, a complaint which will be considered hereafter. It will be evident that when this affection appears in animals that are lean, meagre, and in low condition, it shows the necessity of a more full and nourishing diet.\n\nThe only morbid affection of the external senses, that we shall here consider is blindness, a defect which is of most consequence in the horse, though it may occur in all the domestic animals.\n\nThe eyes of a horse, when perfectly sound, have the cornea or outer covering, and the humours that are seen through it, perfectly clear and transparent; there should be no specks, or dragons as they are called, in either; no greenness or glazy appearance of the pupil, and this should readily contract when suddenly exposed to a clear light. Buffon observes, that in a sound eye, two or three foot-coloured spots appear through the cornea above the pupil.\n\nWhen a horse has a defect in his vision, without being perfectly blind, he appears dull, fearful, and retive, starts at suddenly approaching any object, carries his head high, or to one side; moves his ears alternately, or turns one forwards, while the other is turned backwards; and usually hangs back on his bridle or halter, and lifts his legs up very high.\n\nPartial blindness is a symptom of several diseases in the horse: it usually attends great weakness, especially when this has been brought on by hard work and low feeding; it is a common attendant on locked jaw, and generally precedes the staggers. It of course is one of the effects of old age.\n\nWhen proceeding from debility, it generally goes off in proportion as the strength is restored by rest and proper nourishment; when it is a symptom of other diseases, it goes off when they are removed. The blindness of old age is incurable, and in the horse we believe no method has yet been discovered of relieving the defect by art.\n\nIt is generally allowed, that it is better to have a horse totally, than partially blind; as when quite blind, he is not liable to start, or be shy; and when sure footed, well fed, and managed by a careful rider, there is little danger of his stumbling or falling.\n\nTotal blindness either proceeds from a defect in the optic nerve, by which this is rendered incapable of receiving the impression of light, or from an opacity or muddiness in the cornea or humours, by which the transmission of light through them is obstructed.\n\nThe first species of blindness, or that depending on a glazy eye, defect in the optic nerve, is generally called by farriers glazy eyes, and by medical writers, it is termed amaurosis, or gutta serena.\n\nIt is known by the peculiar glazy appearance of the eye, which seems perfectly clear, so that an ordinary observer would not suppose that there was any defect in the horse's eye. On examining the eye however more attentively, it will be found that the pupil is considerably dilated, and preserves the same size in every change of light; not contracting, as usual, when the light to which it is exposed becomes stronger. There is also a greenish appearance of the eye in this disease.\n\nThe causes of glazy eyes are not well ascertained. It has followed a blow on the head, or inflammatory affections of the brain or its membranes, but it has come on sometimes imperceptibly, and where these diseases, or any other evident cause has not appeared.\n\nThis disease in the horse has hitherto proved incurable.\n\nThe most common cause of blindness in the horse, is an opacity of the lens, or crystalline humour of the cataract eye. This disease is known by the name of cataract, and is sometimes called by farriers, moon blindness, or a horse that has a cataract is said to be moon-eyed.\n\nIt is in general easily discovered that a horse labours under a cataract, as, when the disease is confirmed, an obscenity or muddiness may be seen in the centre of the pupil, occupying more or less of the opening, according as the cataract is more or less extended. The opaque spot is generally of a dull white or yellowish colour. Sometimes the crystalline humour is so fixed to the iris, or that moveable coloured part in the middle of the eye, as to obstruct its motion, and then the pupil retains the same size in every light; or if the adhesion is partial, the pupil of the eye assumes an irregular shape.\n\nIt must be observed, that in this disease, the iris is not always so immovable as in glazy eyes; though when the cataract is fully formed, the pupil is generally enlarged, and contracts very little on the approach of a strong light. Sometimes the lens comes through the pupil altogether, and floats in the watery humour, in the fore part of the eye.\n\nThe cataract in horses is said to be always a consequence of inflammation in the eye, which will be considered in the second section of this part.\n\nThe only method that appears likely to remove the cataract, is an operation by which the opaque lens may be thrust down below the pupil, or entirely extracted from the eye; but neither couching nor extraction can be recommended in the horse, as the removal of the lens would still be attended with a defect of vision that would render the animal of less use, than if he were totally blind.\n\nAnother cause of blindness, and also a consequence of inflammation, is opacity of the cornea. There may be either a diffuse whiteness or muddiness in the cornea, that is more or less extensive; or, there may be specks that\nor warts growing on the outside of this coat, so as to obstruct the passage of the rays of light. Sometimes the opacity of the cornea is only slight, producing partial blindness; but frequently it is universal, and then the horse cannot see at all. This universal opacity of the cornea is sometimes, though improperly, called cataract. It sometimes disappears for a time, and the eye seems nearly as clear as ever; but it generally returns in no long time.\n\nGeneral opacity diffused through the substance of the cornea, does not readily yield to remedies. Attempts have been made, by clarifying the vessels on the white of the eye, or by stimulating applications to the cornea, to rouse into action the absorbent vessels of the eye, and thus remove the opacity; but these attempts seem to have been attended with little success. Specks or warts on the cornea, if they are not too large, may generally be removed by the knife, or by repeatedly blowing into the eye a powder composed of powdered glass and white vitriol. But, if these specks are attended with any general opacity of the cornea, little benefit is to be expected from these operations.\n\nAs the skin is so intimately connected with sensation, we shall here consider some of the more simple affections of that organ, that are not generally attended with fever. It is not uncommon for excrescences or warts to grow on the skins of domestic animals, particularly on horses and oxen. Sometimes they are hard and firm; at others they are soft and sprouting; in some their root is smaller than their head; in others the base is the largest part. The sprouting kind of warts are called by the farriers anger-berries, ambury or ambury, and are not uncommon among oxen. As these are largest at the base, they can, like all of that description, be removed only by touching them daily with some caustic, as lunar caustic, or butter of antimony. Where the wart has a small root, it may be best removed by tying a strong waxed thread round the root, tightening it now and then as it gets loose till the wart drops off. It is in general not proper to remove warts by the knife, unless they are of such a firm consistence as not to bleed on being cut, and to admit of the application of caustic after cutting.\n\nThere sometimes appears on the skin of the horse, a scurfy eruption at the bending of the knee, or the bending of the hock. The eruption generally appears in both places at once, and is called by farriers, the Mallenders and Sullenders; a term which they have borrowed from the French. When considered separately, the eruption of the knee is called the mallenders, and that of the hock the sullenders.\n\nThese eruptions may generally be traced to want of cleanliness, and are, in most cases, easily removed, by washing the parts with soap and water, and applying an ointment, composed of mercurial ointment and camphor; or either of the ointments marked No. 41. and No. 70. in the receipts.\n\nWhen a horse's skin is hard, dry, and unusually tight about the body, the animal is said to be hide-bound. This tightness about the skin is usually the effect of hard work and improper food; and commonly attends lingering diseases, in which the fat is gradually wasted or absorbed. It must therefore be considered rather as a symptom of disease than as a disease itself: but, as is the case with most remarkable symptoms, it has often been regarded as a primary disease; to remove which, by sweating and relaxing remedies, is the principal object of the practitioner.\n\nThe proper remedies for this affection, when it is not a symptom of some lingering disorder, are nourishing diet, with plenty of green food, particular attention to cleanliness, by frequent dressing, and the occasional use of boiled barley and warm mash.\n\nHorses that have a lean, unthrifty-like appearance, suffer with their coats looking rough and ratty, are said by the grooms to labour under a surfeit. Whence has arisen the application of this strange term to an appearance that seems so opposite to what is generally understood by a surfeit, we are not aware; but an affection of the skin, under the name of surfeit, is thus described by Mr Lawrence: \"Its confirmed state is attended with eruptions, and sometimes with swellings of the legs and joints, and in the latter case is usually to be looked upon, as the termination of some chronic disease, or a consequence of the improper use of mercurial physic. Surfeits are styled dry or wet; in the former, the skin is covered with a thick dry scurf, with scabs, and small hard tumours like warbles; in the latter, a sharp briny ichor issues from the poll, neck, withers, quarters, and hinder legs, in the bend of the hock, causing great stiffness and inflammation; this is probably analogous with scurvy in the human body, and will often attend cart-horses, with foul and unwholesome blood, at stated periods. The too free use of beans will produce the wet surfeit.\"\n\n\"The cure of surfeits depends almost entirely upon internal alternatives, with a very small attention to external applications. As to the latter, perhaps, frequent cleansing, with a good strong lather of soap is generally sufficient, but where the eruptions are hard and fixed, and the scabs do not peel off, I know of nothing better than to rub them frequently with the strong mercurial unction, keeping the horse well clothed, and giving warm water in the interim. The warm bath if the animal is strong.\"\n\nOne of the most common diseases of the skin among mange in domestic animals, is what is commonly called the mange horses, in horses, cattle and dogs, and the scab or itch in sheep. Its symptoms differ but little in the different species of animals, and we do not remember to have seen the disorder well described by any writer. The following description of the mange in horses by Mr Feron, is perhaps among the best that have been published. \"The mange is a contagious chronical disorder which manifests itself in the skin, on which sensible eminences of a roundish figure rise up; these being scratched, a fluid oozes out, of a hot and corroding quality, that excoriates the found skin wherever it runs, in a little time forming a dry, scaly, crusty eruption, which in its progress spreads over the whole surface of the body; and the skin becomes unequally thick, thin, hard, and loathsome. If the disorder has been neglected, or ill-treated, the animal falls off from his food, grows lean, and the legs fweel; in this state the patient has frequent fits of shivering and trembling, and a slight fever arises, terminating in farcy or the glanders, by which he is easily destroyed.\"\n\nA disease similar to this, if not of the same kind, affects cattle, especially such as are ill fed, and not kept clean. It is commonly called by herdsmen, the scab or\nDiseases, or scurf; and is thus described in a popular treatise on cow-doctoring.\n\nSkin stiff, and fits fast to every part of the carcass, as if too small for the body. It makes its first appearance about the head and jaws of the animal, with a scurfy, pale, and dry texture; and the beard begins to scratch against everything that comes in its way: it then shows itself along the back, and behind the shoulders; and if timely aid be not procured, the animal will tear its skin till it bleeds violently, which ought to be prevented, if possible, as the scabs which are the consequence of bleeding, much retard the efficacy of the ointment, and the loss of time confirms the disorder.\n\nThis disease is incident to sheep in some particular pastures, situations, and flocks, more than to others. The predisposing cause seems to be a relaxed habit of body, produced by poverty or lameness, though some sheep are subject to it that are fat, and otherwise in good condition. The disease seldom seems to originate with such sheep, but to be conveyed to them by infection.\n\nDogs are exceedingly subject to the mange, and readily catch it from each other. The appearance of the disease in dogs, is familiar to everyone, as there are few more common and disgusting sights than a mangy dog. A dog in this state is very unfit for any active exertion, as the affection of the skin renders him stiff and sore even in his limbs. A friend of ours had a greyhound, that, when he was clean, was one of the swiftest runners in the country, and had gained the prize in many a coursing match. This dog caught the mange, and while in this situation was several times, sent in pursuit of a hare; but now, puts generally escaped him.\n\nThis disease has sometimes been attributed to animals, such as are found in the symptoms of the itch upon the human skin; and analogy seems to be in favour of this idea. It is, however, evidently connected with poor living, and want of cleanliness.\n\nIn the treatment of the mange, we are to rely chiefly on the use of external applications, such as ointments, composed of sulphur, of some preparation of mercury, or hellebore roots. The receipts marked No. 68 and 69 are well adapted to the cure of this disease. Sometimes internal remedies, such as sulphur and gentle laxatives, are required; and the greatest attention must be paid to cleanliness, diet, and exercise. It may be necessary in some cases, especially where the animals that have caught the disease, are very full of blood, to bleed and give cooling phthisic previous to the application of ointment; and in all cases the skin should be thoroughly washed with soap and water, both before and after anointing. The animals should always be confined till they are quite free from the disease.\n\nMr Feron, who considers the mange in horses as a general affection of the system, and not merely a local disease of the skin, strongly recommends the use of blisters, which he has seen act as a specific. \"The local treatment, and the only one to be depended upon (says this gentleman), consists in a judicious application of blisters, used after the following manner; viz. if the whole body is affected, the one half must be blistered one day, and the other in three days after. This must be done at different times, in order to prevent the cantharides from operating too violently upon the kidneys and bladder; but if this happens, let the animal be bled, and clysters frequently injected. But the best way to avoid this, is to leave off all kinds of internal medicines, during the action of the blisters. When they begin to operate, the skin must be fomented with warm water three times a-day, in order to wash out a quantity of yellow matter, discharged by the action of the blisters, and to encourage the growth of new hair.\" We do not pretend to dispute the efficacy of Mr Feron's blistering practice in removing the mange, but we doubt whether the blistering one half of the body with cantharides may not be productive of more serious consequences than the disease which it is intended to remove. At any rate, the expense of the method, and the torment which it must occasion to the poor animal, must greatly prevent the general application of the remedy.\n\nIn Mr Findlater's survey, quoted above, are the following judicious observations on the treatment of sheep labouring under the scab.\n\n\" Sheep that are regularly tarred, or smeared, are seldom infected with this disease. If the disease be partial, perhaps the best remedy would be to clip the affected parts as bare as possible, and rub them occasionally with the common smearing ointment, to which may be added a little Venice turpentine. They should also be washed, once or twice a week, with black soap and water. But if this prove ineffectual, or if the disease has gone to a great extremity, the animal should first be washed as clean as possible, in a pond, or rill of water, to purge away all the accumulated virus, or infecting matter, from the wool. A little black soap may be of great use in washing. Then the whole body may be smeared with juice of tobacco; and after the animal becomes dry, may be rubbed with butter mixed with powdered brimstone; or brimstone mixed with the smearing ointment would answer better. A little of the sulphur may meanwhile be thrown down its throat. If this treatment, being twice or thrice repeated, after an interval of several days, should prove ineffectual, recourse must be had to the mercurial ointment, composed of three ounces of hogs lard, well rubbed in a mortar, with half a drachm of finely powdered corrosive sublimate; or the same proportion of corrosive sublimate, well mixed with three ounces of the common smearing ointment, will answer equally well. The animal being smeared with this ointment, will soon be effectually cured. Meanwhile the diseased animal should be invigorated or put upon substantial food.\"\n\nIn a note Mr Findlater mentions an observation of Mr Loch's of Rachan, that the matter discharged in the scab mixing with the wool, and drying, forms a hard impenetrable crust, which he has observed of half an inch in thickness; that it is vain to think of curing it by any external application, till this is removed; and that you might as well attempt to cure a man of the itch, by rubbing butter and brimstone upon his coat, instead of his naked skin; that the scurf thus formed, must be removed by soaking and washing it with warm lime-water and soap, and scraping it clean to the quick with a blunt knife. It may then be successfully cured by the ointment; or, what is more cleanly and more easily prepared, by means of a lotion made by dissolving half a drachm of corrosive sublimate in a quart (chopin) bottle of whisky and water. Mr Loch has always\nDiseases always found this lotion effectual, after two or three applications.\n\nIt has been proposed by a correspondent of the Farmer's Magazine, to inoculate sheep for the scab, in order to render it milder. Even should inoculation have this effect, which is by no means certain, it does not appear necessary, in a disease that is so easily cured.\n\nBesides the several applications that we have mentioned, a variety of ointments and lotions are recommended by writers on dogs. Mr Beckford advises that as soon as a mange spot appears on a hound, it should be well rubbed with a liniment composed of a pint (mutton) of train oil, half a pint of oil of turpentine, a quarter of a pound of powdered ginger, and half an ounce of gunpowder. It is also recommended that the dog should have a purging ball now and then, and should be kept from fleas meat. There is a variety of the mange in dogs, called the red mange, which it is said is best cured by mercurial ointments.\n\nMost of the domestic animals, especially when young, are troubled with lice. Calves are sometimes louly, if they have been hard kept during winter, by being turned out in severe weather, fed on poor diet, and not kept clean. The best means of destroying these vermin is by rubbing their hide with an ointment composed of slaves-acre, or cayenne pepper, mixed up with hogs lard.\n\nYoung whelps are very subject to lice; but they may be easily removed by washing with a lotion formed by steeping a pound of tobacco in three English pints of small beer, or by rubbing the skin well with train-oil.\n\nFleas are best destroyed by washing the dogs frequently with soft soap and water.\n\nSheep are often infected with vermin of various kinds, which harass the animals exceedingly; and not only do much mischief to the wool, but even eat into the animal's skin.\n\nThe sheep fly abounds most in the southern parts of the island, and is chiefly troublesome to lambs. The most effectual means of protecting the lambs from the insect appears to be to smear the fleece with any kind of rancid oil.\n\nAnother species of insects that infect sheep is commonly called tick, or kedd, the hippobosca ovina of naturalists.\n\nThe smearing ointment generally prevents, or kills this insect. But if this should not happen, or if the sheep are not smeared, insects of every kind may be effectually killed, by slightly rubbing the parts affected with mercurial ointment, composed of three ounces of hogs lard, rubbed up with half a drachm of finely powdered corrosive sublimate. To this may be added, a little of the spirit of turpentine. Coal-oil is powerfully destructive to insects of every kind; but whether it may not prove injurious to the health or fleece of the sheep, has not yet been ascertained by experiment. A decoction or distillation from the gall-plant, which abounds in many moors and muirs, is known to be very fatal to insects of every kind; and a sheep may be safely washed with this juice. The juice of tobacco is also much recommended as a poison for those insects which infect sheep.\n\nThe last species of insects are chiefly hurtful to sheep among the insects which prove most troublesome to horses, sheep, and cattle, are those of the genus Oe. trus, some species of which are generally known by the name of gad-fly. The best account of these insects and their effects, that we have seen, is that of Mr Bracey Clark, published in the third volume of the Linnaean Transactions, from which the following account is chiefly taken.\n\nMr Clark describes five species of Oe. trus, viz. Oe. bovis, Oe. equi, Oe. haemorrhoidalis, Oe. veterinus, and Oe. ovis.\n\nWe shall at present describe the effects only of the first and last species.\n\nThe Oe. bovis, as its name imports, chiefly attacks Gail-fly, or cattle, through the skins of which it pierces, in order to deposit its eggs. The pain which it inflicts in doing so, appears to be much more severe than what is excited by any of the other species. When one of the cattle is attacked by this fly, it is easily known by the extreme terror and agitation that seizes the whole herd. The unfortunate object of attack runs bellowing from among his fellows, to some distant part of the pasture, or to the nearest water, holding his tail, from the severity of the pain, extended straight from the body, in a line with his back, with a tremulous motion, and stretching out his head and neck to the utmost. The rest of the herd, infected with the like fear, though not attacked, fly also to the water, or disappear to different parts of the pasture.\n\n\"Such is the dread and apprehension in the cattle, for this fly, says Mr Clark, that I have seen one of them meet the herd when almost driven home, and turn them back, regardless of the stones, sticks, and noise of their drivers; nor could they be flopped till they reached their accustomed retreat in the water.\"\n\nWhen one of these flies happens to attack oxen that are yoked in the plough, there is often considerable danger, as the animals become quite ungovernable, and will often rush directly forwards with the plough, through hedges, or whatever opposes their career.\n\nHorses, steers, and the younger cattle, are in general most frequently attacked by this fly; the strongest and most healthy beasts seem constantly to be preferred by it, and this circumstance is said to be a criterion of goodflesh held in much esteem by the dealers in cattle. Tanners also have remarked, that their best and strongest hides have generally the greatest number of holes in them.\n\nThe larvae of this species, as of most of those we are to mention, are generally termed bots, but this name is most frequently applied to the larvae of the Oe. equi.\n\nThe complaint produced by the puncture of this insect in the skins of cattle, is called puckeridge, and is not unfrequently attributed to the bite of the goat-fucker. For the destruction of the larvae thus deposited, it has been recommended to insert a red-hot wire into each of the holes made in the skin; but this is a formidable remedy, and will probably do as much harm to the skin as the bots themselves. A more rational practice that is sometimes in use, is to press the parts, and rub them well with a little oil of turpentine, or some other stimulating application, or a little oil of turpentine may be injected into each hole.\nThe larvae of the *Oe. bovis* are commonly known to the country people by the names of *worms*, or *worms*, or *woolworms*. During the summer, sheep are often observed to gather together in clutters, endeavouring carefully to guard their heads. Mr Blaine says that this is to protect themselves against the attacks of this insect, which attempts to lay its eggs on the inner margin of the nose, which when it has effected, these eggs become larvae, and creep up into the frontal and maxillary sinuses.\n\nIt is not easy to discover the manner in which this insect deposits its eggs, owing to its obscure colour and rapid motions, and to the great agitation into which the sheep are thrown by its attack; but the subsequent motion of the sheep, and the manner in which they attempt to defend themselves against their enemy, leave no room to doubt, that the eggs are deposited on the inner margin of the nostrils.\n\nThe moment the fly touches this part of the sheep, they shake their heads, and strike the ground violently with their fore feet, at the same time holding their noses close to the earth; they run away, looking about them on every side, to see whether the fly pursues; they also smell to the grass, as they go, lest one should be lying in wait for them. As they cannot, like horses, take refuge in the water, they have recourse to a rut, or dry dusty road, or gravel-pits, where they crowd together during the heat of the day, with their noses held close to the ground, which renders it difficult for the fly conveniently to get at the nostril.\n\nObservations on these flies are best made in warm weather, and during the heat of the day, when by driving the sheep from their retreats to the grass, the attack of the fly, and the emotions of the sheep, are easily observed.\n\nThe nostril from repeated attacks, and the consequent rubbing against the ground, becomes highly inflamed and sore, which occasions their touch to be so much dreaded by the sheep.\n\nIt is said that this fly also deposits its eggs in the skin of the sheep, but we are not certain how far this has been proved by experience; although there is no doubt that there are sometimes found in the sheep's skin, maggots that must have been produced from eggs deposited by some insect. They prove extremely troublesome to the animal, eating into the skin, and producing ulcers. If not discovered in time they may even destroy the life of the sheep. The remedy is to clip the infected parts bare, wash them well with black soap and water, and apply the smearing ointment. If this does not succeed, recourse must be had to the method recommended, in No. 337.\n\nWhen sheep have lain about for a long time in wet and marshy pastures, or have been kept in woods or copses in a starving condition, their fleeces become so completely soaked with water, that the wool rots off from the skin. This is what is called the *pelt-rot*. If sheep be suffered to continue long in this condition, they become heavy and low-spirited, and will sooner or later be destroyed. If, however, they be attended to in proper time, they may be saved by driving them to a good straw-yard, pulling off their ragged and rotten wool, and rubbing on a good coat of tar, grease, and turpentine. Care must also be taken, to provide them with plenty of good wholesome nourishment.\n\nThe skin of all animals, especially on the most delicate parts of it, is subject to excoriation or chafing. This is of most consequence in the backs of horses fretted with the saddle, and the udders of cows by rubbing against their thighs, when they are cat-hammed, &c., and go close behind. Both the udder and thighs of the cow are sometimes quite raw, and ulcerated. The best remedy in these cases, is to wash the parts well with warm soap and water, and afterwards bathe them frequently with a mixture of Goulard, and camphorated spirits.\n\nThe teats of cows are sometimes chapped, which is commonly owing to want of cleanliness in the milkers. When this happens, the treatment recommended above for chapping may be followed, or if this does not succeed, the teats may be anointed with what is called unguentum nutritum. If the teats are very painful, the cracks may first be bathed with a little laudanum, and afterwards filled up with finely powdered prepared chalk.\n\nThere are many other diseases that affect the skin of these animals; but some of them are so trifling as not to require particular notice, and others being intimately connected with some general derangement of the system, fall more properly to be considered in the next section of this part.\n\n**Chap. II. Morbid Affections of Motion.**\n\nThe function of motion may be morbidly affected in various ways, but all these tend more or less to impede or disturb the natural motions of the animal.\n\nThe muscles are often affected with irregular motions, producing violent involuntary contractions, called convulsions or spasms. These are often symptoms of some dangerous derangement of the brain or nervous system, as locked-jaw, epilepsy, canine madness, &c. Convulsions of this nature, being intimately dependent on the primary disease, can only be removed by such means, as are calculated to carry off the disease, of which they are the symptoms. Irregular action of the muscles commonly attends great debility, whether it be brought on by hard work and low diet, or by disease. In either case, it is commonly a very dangerous symptom. We cannot properly consider the treatment of convulsion here; but it will be considered in the next section, when we come to treat of convulsive or spasmodic diseases.\n\nThe affection that we are chiefly called to consider of lameness in this chapter is lameness, a very comprehensive term, as it includes almost all the local affections of the extremities. Lameness is a complaint that is exceedingly common among horses and dogs, especially the former; in whom it more particularly demands attention, as it so materially affects the value of the animal. A knowledge of the nature of lameness, and the method of treating it, can only be acquired by an investigation of the causes by which it is produced.\n\nThe causes of lameness are extremely numerous and various. We shall endeavour to classify them, so as to render our inquiry as little tedious and difficult as may be.\n\n1. Lameness may be produced by a stiffness of some stiff parts of the muscles, tendons, or ligaments, arising either from excessive labour, from bruises, wounds, or some diseased affection of the joints.\nIt is well known, that when the muscles of an animal are exerted for any unusual length of time, or in a more than ordinary degree, they become fatigued, and cannot for some time perform their functions with their accustomed ease. In general, after proper rest and careful treatment, the stiffness gradually goes off; and in a day or two the animal is able to exert himself as usual; but if care has not been taken to rub him well down, and provide him with a well littered bed, and especially if he has been exposed to cold while sweating and fatigued, this stiffness may continue for many days, or may even degenerate into permanent lameness. Animals that have acquired this permanent stiffness of their limbs, always move with considerable difficulty, when first taken out; but in general when they have been long in exercise, and are become warm, the stiffnesses and lameness in a great measure disappear, but they commonly return again when the exertion is over.\n\nWhere the stiffness has not continued long, it may in general be easily removed, by frequent friction of the limbs, first with a wisp of hay and the brush, and afterwards with some warm liniment or embrocation, such as has been described among the stimulant receipts.\n\nIf it does not yield to this treatment, recourse may be had to warm fomentations, and gentle exercise must be persisted in. If the lameness should still continue, it will probably be occasioned by a strain of some ligament, or an injury done to some part of the limb.\n\nAny of the muscular parts may be bruised by falls or blows; and if the bruise takes place on the limbs, or in their neighbourhood, lameness may be the consequence. A bruise is almost always followed by a swelling of the bruised part, occasioned by the rupture of small vessels, that pour out their fluids into the cellular membrane. If the bruise is slight, the swelling will soon subside; but if the injury has been considerable, and much blood has been poured out, inflammation and consequent suppuration will take place, and the part will become an abscess. If the injury has been still greater, and the texture of the parts has been destroyed, mortification will probably come on, and if the bruise be extensive, will be attended with considerable danger.\n\nThe treatment of bruises will be different according to the degree of the injury produced. In slight cases the object will be to promote the absorption of the effused blood; and this will be best answered by bathing the part with warm vinegar and water, or camphorated spirit. If there is considerable inflammation, and it is not judged proper to encourage a suppuration, the parts must be frequently bathed with a solution of sugar of lead, with a little vinegar; or, where the part admits of a bandage, it will be better to form a cold poultice of oatmeal mixed up with such a solution, and kept constantly applied to the part and frequently moistened with the solution to prevent its becoming hard and dry. If a suppuration should appear unavoidable, it will be proper to encourage it by a frequent application of warm poultices renewed as often as they become cool, or, where these cannot be applied, by repeatedly fomenting the part with flannel wrung out of warm water. When the suppuration is complete, the swelling must be opened with a lancet, or by means of a feton; and the sore must be treated as we shall presently describe with respect to ulcers. If mortification takes place, the parts must be frequently fomented with the fomentation directed in No. 57, of the receipts; and the animal's strength must be supported by nourishing food, and the occasional use of cordial and strengthening remedies. If the mortified part be very extensive, it may be necessary to make incisions towards the edges with a knife, to promote the separation of the flough; or firing may be employed, as directed for this purpose in No. 175.\n\nIt sometimes happens that after the inflammation which attended a bruise has subsided, a permanent hard tumour is left, that prevents the free motion of the muscles of the part. This may arise either from a thickening of some ligament, or the cellular texture, or it may proceed from an excrescence formed on the bone, in consequence of the bruise. The treatment in such cases will be presently described, when we come to consider splints, ring-bones, and other tumours that commonly produce lameness.\n\nHorses are very liable to receive severe bruises in the Tread, or back part of the foot, either from the tread of another overreaching horse, as often happens in the army, by a horse in the rear-rank treading on the heels of one in the front-rank; or, by a horse overreaching his hind foot, and thus bruising the heels of the fore foot. From the manner in which this accident is produced, it has received the names of tread, and overreach. Sometimes the bruise is so slight as to be productive of no farther ill consequence than a temporary lameness; but if the tread has been very violent, the edges of the part trodden on may be so much bruised as to produce considerable inflammations, or even a mortification. In ordinary cases it is sufficient to wash the part carefully with warm water, to clear it of dirt and gravel, then apply a pledget dipped in spirits, and bind up the foot, so as to exclude the external air; when the bruise, if slight, will probably soon heal. But in some cases matter is formed, which makes its way downwards towards the sole, forming what is called a quitter. Quitters may also take place from a puncture in the foot, by a nail or other pointed body, the effects and treatment of which will be presently described.\n\nIn a newly-formed quitter, it is of consequence to ascertain, whether it has been produced by a prick or a tread. In the former case the matter usually makes its way upwards from the punctured part towards the coronet; and here the practice generally followed by farriers is, to fear the upper orifice with a hot iron, which answers no other purpose than to confine the matter within the wound, where it must produce extensive ulceration and destruction of important parts of the foot. In the latter case, where quitter is produced by a tread, and where the tissue formed is very superficial, the use of the cautery may be very proper; and if it can be so applied as to inflame the whole extent of the wound, it may entirely carry off the disease. According to Mr. Blane, there are too general methods of curing quitter; one by removing a part of the hoof, cutting away the diseased parts, or suffering them to flough off or exfoliate. The other, to apply caustic to the diseased surfaces, introducing it within the confines, thus destroying the ulcerated parts, and allowing the healthy parts to throw them off. The latter is called by farriers coreing out a quitter, as they suppose that\nthe core or flough that comes away formed a part of the complaint. Mr Blaine objects to removing the hoof, as it would take up a considerable time before new horn can be formed; and it is probable that in the new hoof there will be a false quarter, which will render the horse unfound, besides that, during the formation of the new hoof, fresh sinuses may be produced.\n\nIn the method of cure by caustic, he thinks that the disease may be completely removed in three or four weeks, whereas the other method may require as many months. The mode of applying the caustic is, to examine carefully the extent and direction of the sinuses, and then to fill them up with powdered blue vitriol, verdigrise, or corrosive sublimate. Mr Blaine has found that a paste made of corrosive sublimate, mixed up with flour and butter, forms a very good caustic for this purpose. Some of it is to be introduced by means of a probe, to which a piece of sponge is fastened, which must be carefully introduced in every direction, so as to touch all the diseased parts, after which the whole foot is to be bound up; but the bandage must not be applied too tightly. In two or three days the dressings are to be renewed, and this is to be repeated at intervals till the floughs come away, when a healthy action of the parts will take place, and the cure soon be completed. Another method of introducing caustic, by which the sinuses may be completely filled, is to mix up the caustic with hog's lard, and roll the mats into small pellets within gauze-paper, which may be easily introduced into the cavities.\n\nMany farriers have fallen into a mistake with respect to the nature and treatment of quittor, that has been the ruin of many horses. They suppose, that during the progress of this disease, a bone is formed which they call a quittor bone; and they think it necessary to remove this bone, before a cure can be completed. This error seems to have arisen from an opinion of Laffitte, who conceived that the derangement which accompanied this disease originated in the cartilages being affected, which he affirmed were capable of being thus diseased, but incapable either of exfoliating like bone, or sloughing like ligament; and therefore that to promote a cure, the whole of the lateral cartilage on the affected side must be removed. But his first premises were erroneous, for cartilages are vascular, as we know by their being tinged with bile, and by their being at times absorbed; this is particularly the case with the lateral cartilages, which in almost all old horses are partly absorbed. As they are vascular, they must be capable of living action; though it is slow, and hence where disease exists, they will exfoliate like other parts. This practice of Laffitte has in this country been for some time tried among many of the more intelligent farriers, and was still further propagated by the late Professor St Bel. Many horses have been ruined by this injudicious practice; for the future elasticity of the foot, which is in a great measure dependent on these cartilages, must be lost; besides the necessary removal of the hoof to get at the cartilage, a false quarter almost always remains*.\n\nWounds are frequently inflicted in the soft parts of horses and dogs, and these are more common in the legs, feet, and joints, than in any other parts. The treatment of wounds must depend in a great measure on the part where they are inflicted, and the form of the instrument that produced them. A clean cut made in the muscular parts is easily healed, by applying flaps of sticking plaster as soon as possible, so as to keep the edges of the wound close together; or where plaster cannot readily be applied, by taking a flitch or two through the edges of the wound, and tying the flings gently together. When the edges are found to adhere, the flings must be cut away, and the holes which they made will soon fill up. If any considerable blood-vein has been wounded, it will be proper to secure it, if possible, by means of ligature, rather than by applying any styptic substance. All wounds should be made as clean as possible, before any attempt is made to heal them. Sometimes the wound is so situated that it will not admit of being sewed up; but in these cases we may in general pass silver or steel pins from the edges, at about an inch distance from each other, and twist a thread crooked from one to the other, so as to form what is called the twisted suture. In all cases where sutures are used, it will be proper to apply a sticking plaster over the edges of the wound. If the wound should not heal by these means, a formation of matter will take place, and then the sore is to be treated as a common ulcer, taking care that its edges be always kept as near together as may be, by sticking plaster or a bandage.\n\nIf the wound is very large, it may excite considerable inflammation and fever. In these cases, if the animal is plethoric, it will be proper to bleed him, or at any rate to administer cooling remedies. If, on the other hand, there has been much loss of blood, or if the wound shows no disposition to heal, and the matter formed is thin and ichorous, an opposite plan of treatment will be required. The animal must be supported by nourishing food, and strengthening remedies.\n\nThe most troublesome wounds are those of the feet and joints, as they are in general very difficult to be healed.\n\nWounds in the feet are not uncommonly produced by the horse treading on sharp stones, broken glass, the feet, sharp bones or nails. These are generally punctured wounds, and will be considered presently. Sometimes a deep wound is made on the coronet, by a sharp part of the heel of the shoe on the opposite foot, or any other substance penetrating downwards between the coffin-bone and the hoof, or between the lateral cartilages of the coffin-bone and the joint. Wounds of this kind are attended with much danger, from the difficulty of evacuating the matter that may be formed, or of producing that healthy action in the parts that is necessary to make them heal. In such cases Mr Feron recommends the application of a blister, extending from the fetlock to the foot, so as to produce external irritation, which may relieve the internal parts. In the meantime the foot is to be kept in a vessel of warm water all day, and a large warm poultice of bran and water is to be applied round it at night. The intention of this practice is to prevent suppuration, but if this should, nevertheless, take place, and if matter should be formed between the hoof and the sensitive laminae; the suppuration is to be encouraged, and we are to endeavour to prevent the formation of sinuses, by rasping the hoof very thin, just below the seat of the wound, so that we may be able to make an orifice for the evacuation of the matter downwards. Mr Feron advises\nadvices to delay this opening as long as possible, and when it is performed, to take care that the lamina be properly pricked after the operation, to prevent coming out through the hoof, and forming an incurable sandcrack, or false-quarter. The bathing the foot in warm water, and the application of the bran poultice, must be continued till the foot is perfectly healed. If proud fleas should appear through the opening that has been made in the hoof, it is to be pared away with a sharp knife, then fixed, and covered with a small pendent spread with soft ointment, on which is sprinkled a little powdered blue vitriol. It is evident that, during the cure, the horse must be kept perfectly at rest; and it is recommended to administer diuretics, and now and then a gentle dose of physic, to keep the bowels moderately open.\n\nWounds in the joints are commonly attended with very serious consequences, as it frequently happens that the capsular ligament is divided, and in this case the synovia or joint-oil constantly exuding through the opening, prevents the disposition to heal. A wound in the joints is common among horses in the army, and such as are employed in hunting; and a horse that has received such a wound in general becomes perfectly useless, from the improper method of treating these wounds that has in general prevailed among farriers. By their treatment, either an incurable sinus is produced, or a secretion of bony matter takes place within the joint, forming what is called an anchylosis or stiff joint. The method generally practised by ordinary farriers is, to inject within the joint a mixture of turpentine and oil of vitriol, a solution of corrosive sublimate and lime water, or some other corrosive substance. The more rational of them content themselves with an injection of tincture of myrrh. All these substances produce such a high degree of inflammation within the joint, as not unfrequently to destroy the animal.\n\nOf late, a much more rational mode of treatment has been adopted by Mr Coleman, and is described in the first number of the Veterinary Transactions.\n\nThe following is the method recommended by Mr Coleman for treating wounds of the joints and capsules.\n\n\"Where a joint, a mucous capsule, or the sheath of a tendon is opened, the first application necessary is the actual cautery. The instrument most proper for the operation should be made of iron, two feet in length, rounded at the extremity about the size of a small button, with a wooden handle. The temperature of the iron should be moderately red. If it be black, the heat will not be sufficient to produce a proper discharge of lymph, to close up the wound; and if it is white, it will destroy too much of the surrounding parts, and perhaps do mischief to the ligament. Although the operation in itself is very simple, yet some knowledge of the structure and economy of the parts, for the purpose of applying the cautery with the best possible effect, is necessary. The object in view is to produce a glutinous substance to close up the cavity, and before the slough is removed, for granulations below to supply the place of the lymph; but if the ligament itself be destroyed by the cautery, it must, like other dead parts, separate from the living and come away, and then the joint will still be opened. It is, therefore, of importance not to destroy the ligament of joints with the hot iron, but confine its application to the external soft parts. In these cases, it is generally proper to cauterize the whole external surface of the wound; and if the discharge is not immediately stopped, the iron has probably not been applied sufficiently deep, or too cold, to produce a proper discharge of lymph. Where a cure is possible to be effected, the actual cautery will frequently close the cavity and stop the discharge. Sometimes, however, in the course of one, two, or three days, the discharge appears again by the sides of the lymph, and then the same operation should be repeated. In some instances Mr Coleman has had occasion to apply the hot iron five or six times, and nevertheless succeeded ultimately, without the least lameness. The same treatment is likewise to be recommended for penetrating wounds into the chest and abdomen. The lips of the wound should be cauterized, and, if requisite, repeated in the same manner as is recommended for wounds of other cavities. When the cavities of veins become inflamed, some little variation is necessary in the treatment, as accidents of that nature are frequently attended with consequences different from the opening of other cavities, and require a trifling alteration in the treatment. When a hemorrhage takes place, it may be very generally stopped by the application of the cautery; but if this fails, and the parts are too much swollen to admit of a pin, there is no other remedy than to take up the vein by a ligature above the diseased parts; and there may be instances in which it may be advisable to tie up the vein below. In general, however, the actual cautery will prevent the necessity of a ligature; and if it fails, tying up the vein will succeed only in those cases where the vein above is free from disease. In general, the vein is thickened and inflamed, and if a ligature be applied on a vessel in a state of inflammation, the disease will be formed, and the vein inflame above. In a case that occurred to Mr Goodwin, veterinary surgeon at Oxford, where the jugular vein was tied, an abscess took place over the occipital bone, commonly termed the poll evil. That disease, however, most probably did not originate in consequence of the tube being obliterated, for in most successful cases of inflamed veins, the sides of the vein unite and destroy the cavity. After the orifice of the inflamed vein, from the application of the actual cautery, is closed, a considerable degree of swelling frequently remains, and this may be removed by a blister. When abscesses form in the adjacent parts, they should be treated in the same manner as common abscesses.\"\n\nA puncture of some part of the lower surface of the foot is a frequent occurrence. It may arise from the wounds prick of a nail in shoeing, from a nail picked up in travelling; or from glass, flint, or any other sharp body. Injuries of this kind are proportioned in their effects, to the parts punctured, and not entirely to the depth of the wound. A puncture of the frog penetrating even to the fleshy frog, is not usually so serious, as that which penetrates the sole; hence a wound anywhere at the hinder part may penetrate deeper with impunity than towards the centre, and likewise in the front, though considerable inflammation usually follows from this last. When the capsular ligament is wounded in these cases, the consequence may be very serious, as a stiff joint is commonly produced. When it is found that the capsular ligament has been wounded, the external opening must be enlarged, and a hot iron must be applied to\nthe surface of the skin that covers the wounded part of the ligament, in order to heal up the internal opening. Considerable irritation commonly attends a punctured wound of the tendon, or its sheath; and it is best removed by enlarging the wound that is made through the horny part, and keeping the feet for some time in warm water. When matter appears in either of these cases, it must be let out, and the wound must be healed in the usual manner.\n\nThe most usual case of punctures is that which arises from a nail in hoeing taking a wrong direction, when instead of penetrating the outer surface of the crust, it turns inwards, and thus wounds the sensitive laminae. This is known to the smith at the time by a peculiar feel in the stroke he gives, and by the flinching; when, if the nail is immediately removed, and has not penetrated far, the wound heals by the first intention; but if it is suffered to remain, it produces inflammation and suppuration. As soon as this is discovered, a depending orifice should be made for the matter, by making an opening in the line of the hole at which the nail entered. It is always prudent, when a nail has penetrated, and lameness follows without matter appearing, to remove the shoe, and enlarging the opening to apply a pledget of tow dipped in spirits of wine, which will frequently prevent any future effects: but whenever matter has formed, it is indispensible necessary; for otherwise the matter will proceed upwards, and coming out at an opening on the coronet, it will form a quitter. When by this treatment the matter has gained a depending situation, and the inflammation has subsided, the part may be dressed with any mild ointment; but if the matter should increase in quantity, it will be proper to pour a solution of white vitriol within to promote a stoppage of the discharge, and of the extension of the ulcerative process. In every puncture, when the heat and inflammation appear considerable, bleeding at the toe is a prudent measure, as it cools the vessels.\n\nDogs are frequently wounded with thorns in their feet or knees, and the thorn may be so deeply lodged, that it cannot easily be extracted. When the foot is wounded with a thorn, the best application is a plaster of black pitch, which is said to have succeeded when every thing else has failed. If there is much inflammation, it will be proper to apply a poultice over the plaster. When a dog is wounded in the knee, if there is reason to suppose that a thorn is left in the wound, the same applications will be proper; and when the thorn comes away, if there is still an oozing of fluid from the orifice, a red-hot iron must be applied, as in the wounds of the joints in horses. If no thorn is left in the wound, a little digestive ointment rubbed upon the part, and a subsequent application of a poultice made with Goulard and crumbs of bread, with proper rest, will probably soon effect a cure.\n\nLameness is not unfrequently produced by a stiff joint, or what the surgeons call ankylosis. This is generally the effect of an injury done to the articulating surfaces of the bones that compose the joint, causing the formation of new bony matter, which gets between the bones, and unites them together. A stiff joint may perhaps be sometimes prevented by the timely use of blisters and firing; but when completely formed, the lameness is incurable.\n\n2. The second head of causes that produce lameness will comprehend strains, fractures, and luxations.\n\nStrains may take place in any of the muscular parts, or ligaments, but they most commonly happen in the fleasty part of the shoulder, or in some of the ligaments of the feet.\n\nA strain in the muscles of the shoulder, has been generally called a shoulder-flip, under the idea that the shoulder-bone has been disjointed, or the blade-bone pushed out of its place; but the fracture of the parts shews that the former of these accidents can scarcely happen, on account of the great strength of the capsular and other ligaments that surround the shoulder joint; and a dislocation of the blade-bone is, by the extent and strength of the muscles that unite it with the ribs, nearly impossible, unless by such a force as is sufficient to destroy the texture of the muscles, and tear the limb from the body. A strain of these muscles, and of the ligaments that surround the shoulder joint, is, however, by no means an unfrequent occurrence, but affections of other parts are often mistaken for a shoulder strain, as we shall see presently. A strain in the shoulder, when first received, is generally attended with considerable inflammation and swelling of the part, which are usually sufficient to distinguish it from other affections. When the strain has continued long, and the inflammation has subsided, the distinction is not so easy.\n\nIn cases of recent shoulder strains, it will be proper to draw blood from the plate vein, and if the inflammation is extensive, to administer a purge, and keep the animal rather low, to keep down the inflammation as much as possible; and it will be proper to bathe the parts frequently, with some astringent lotion, or with a warm fomentation, as directed under bruise. A rowel may also be placed in the chest, or a feton in the inside of the fore-leg. Complete rest is necessary; and to render this the more perfect, the horse should be fitted with a patten shoe, and should have a bed of litter constantly below him. When the inflammation has subsided, gentle friction, and the occasional use of astringent lotions, will in general soon restore the use of the limb; and as soon as the horse can bear it, moderate exercise may be employed.\n\nInjuries done to the ligaments and tendons, are also usually called strains; but if we understand by this term, the inflammation of the strained part, the appellation is improper, since the tendons appear to be entirely without tendons, elasticity, and the ligaments nearly so. These parts cannot, therefore, be properly strained, though by unusual exertion, their texture may be so far injured as to produce stiffness, inflammation, and swelling, but will have the same effect in causing lameness, as a strain.\n\nInjuries of this kind are more dangerous than mere muscular strains, their treatment is more difficult, and the cure more tedious. The treatment usually adopted by ordinary farriers, is to apply the same astringent and stimulating lotions, as in strains; but here they commonly do harm, as they generally produce a greater secretion of coagulable lymph, which still more obstructs the motion of the part, and renders the lameness permanent.\n\nOne of the worst cases of these injuries, is what farriers\nWhen a horse trips or stumbles, and makes an unusual effort to save himself from falling, or when the heels are lowered in shoeing too suddenly, or too much at once, so as to throw too great a weight upon them, there often happens such a sudden or violent contraction of the flexor muscles as may produce a partial laceration, or even rupture of the flexor tendon, or its sheath. This injury is attended with considerable inflammation, and the consequent lameness is of the worst kind. A great stiffness and swelling is produced, and there is commonly an effusion of fluid, which is at first serous, and may again be taken up by the absorbent vessels; but if improper applications are employed, coagulable lymph may be poured out, so as to obstruct the motion of the part, and produce that swelling, or permanent enlargement, that we sometimes see in the neighborhood of the tendon, after what is called a strain of the back finews.\n\nWhen a horse is strained in the back finews, he puts forward his leg and foot in a loofe, faint, and faltering manner. Mr Lawrence gives the following directions for ascertaining whether or not a horse is injured in the back finews. To try how far the horse has been injured, let him be walked about for half an hour, when the swelling of his legs will in all probability subside. If you then observe the tendo achillis, or main finew, distinct from the flank; if, on pressing it with the finger towards the bone, you find it firm and tense; if you discover by the feel, no soft spongy finews between the flank and the tendon, no extraordinary pulsation, but that all is well braced and wiry, you may conclude the swellings not dangerous. A person of experience, with a nice discriminating finger, will scarce ever fail to detect lameness in the back finews.\n\nMr Feron is of opinion that the injury which we have described is not done to the flexor tendon, but to the ligaments of the neighboring joints. He says, that \"on the direction of a strain supposed to be in the back finews, we discover no affection in the substance of this part, which on the contrary appears perfectly sound. But on examining the ligaments of the fetlock, coronet, and foot, we find them to be the seat of the disease; we find also, that if the accident has been violent, and of long duration, the whole vascular system of the leg is found affected, but never, or very seldom, the back finews; it is in this violent state that we observe sometimes one or two swellings along the tendons. It is also on this account that the pain is so great, and so hard to be cured, in consequence of the considerable irritation which takes place in the surrounding parts.\" So the increase of thickness of the leg, is nothing more than the effect of the disease; but not the disease itself, as farriers, grooms, &c., suppose it to be. Nevertheless, we said before that the back finews or tendons were void of feeling in a state of health and incapable of extension. It may be very true that this injury is not commonly seated in the tendon; but we cannot agree with Mr Feron, that this part is never the seat of it, especially as he himself allows that a rupture of the tendon may take place, of which he has seen different instances. It is not difficult to conceive that the same exertion which when in a great degree is capable of rupturing the tendon, may in a smaller degree produce a partial laceration, or a strain in the back finews.\n\nA horse labouring under this injury, even after the inflammation has subsided, is extremely weak and stiff in the joints of the foot; but when he has been for some time at work, the lameness in some measure goes off. This has led some persons to suppose that a strained horse may be worked sound; but this is a very erroneous opinion, and the practice of continuing to work a horse that has been newly strained, under the idea of removing the stiffness, is equally cruel and injudicious.\n\nThe treatment of strains or injuries of the ligaments or tendons must be such as will most effectually prevent inflammation, and promote the absorption of the effused fluid. Local bleeding from the veins of the part, and warm fomentations frequently repeated, seem to be the most advisable; and a bandage should be always applied where the nature of the parts will admit of it, and should be continued till the lameness is removed. Various stimulating applications have been recommended in these cases, as soon as the inflammation has subsided, such as oil of turpentine, camphorated spirit, varnish, &c.; but they must not be employed while any considerable inflammation remains. It is somewhat remarkable that Mr Feron recommends astringent and stimulating applications in the text of his work, and says there that they may be employed with safety; but, in a note at the foot of the page, he speaks of having inferred those astringent prescriptions for the purpose of satisfying the different opinions, but that he is fully convinced, by a long experience, that warm fomentations and warm poultices of bran and water, are infinitely preferable in strains or contusions, to these expensive prescriptions, and are always to be tried first.\n\nIt will be proper to elevate the heels of the horse's shoe by calkins, and Mr Blaine recommends that the heels of the hoof be encouraged to grow, or that a thick-heeled shoe be used. If there still remains much swelling, firing will prove one of the most effectual remedies, as it will both promote the absorption of the effused fluid, and will produce such a degree of contraction of the skin as will answer the purpose of a permanent bandage. In such cases the cautery must be applied, so as to make perpendicular lines on the skin.\n\nDogs are very subject to strains; and where there are strains of flight, a mixture of spirit of wine and oil of turpentine, the stiffest or strong Goulard, applied before a fire, is the most useful remedy. Sometimes from blows or other accidents, such as slipping their hind-legs, or getting them entangled in the bars of a gate, hounds are lam'd in their stifles, as it is called. In general the above applications and long rest will remove the lameness; but when a considerable quantity of coagulable lymph has been effused, it is not easily re-absorbed, and the lameness continues. When this happens, some huntsmen recommend the operation of cutting for the stiffle, and Mr Daniel speaks of a huntsman who used to perform this operation very dexterously in the following manner. The bone is laid bare by a transverse cut, and upon it is found a substance like a stiff jelly, which is the cause of the lameness, and is in fact the coagulable lymph that has been effused. This jelly is taken away, and a wire is run through the ball of the hind-foot on the contrary side, and twisted in such a manner as to keep that leg from touching the ground, so that the hound may be compelled to use the lifted leg. In this way the dogs were always cured. The same huntsman recommended that\nthat when a dog had been entangled in a gate or flite, he should, as soon as released, be taken by the hind-feet, and twisted round five or six times, turning with him; and it is said that this prevented any ill consequence from the bruises that he received in the flite, while endeavouring to disengage himself.\n\nSome of the ligaments or tendons of the extremities are now and then ruptured. This is not a common case, but it may happen, either to the suspensory ligament, or the back finew.\n\nA rupture of the suspensory ligament is found most likely to happen to young horses while breaking, and to cavalry horses while under training. The accident is generally called breaking down, as when it happens the horse appears unable to support himself. The fetlock is brought almost to the ground, and the limb is evidently exceedingly weak; but the horse can bend his foot when he raises it. This circumstance distinguishes a rupture of the suspensory ligament from that of the flexor tendon or back finew; as, in the latter case, the power of the flexor muscle being destroyed, the horse is unable to bend the foot.\n\nIt appears from the observations of Mr Coleman, and some experiments that have been made by Mr Feron, that the flexor tendon has little or no effect in giving support to the heels; but that this office is almost entirely performed by the suspensory ligament. Hence, when this is ruptured, the horse loses one of his principal stays, and the foot is of course unable to support its usual weight, whence the horse breaks down.\n\nA perfect cure of this accident can seldom be expected; and the only way to relieve the animal will be to obviate the inflammation as much as possible, and to elevate the limb, and especially to raise the heels, in order to relax the injured parts. An intermediate substance will in time be produced between the two parts of the broken ligament, that will enable the horse to walk and perform some of his functions, but he cannot afterwards be depended on for the road or the field.\n\nWhen it is ascertained that the back finew has been ruptured, which is discovered by the inability of the horse to bend his foot backwards, it is generally recommended to kill the horse, as a cure is by most deemed impracticable. Mr Blaine recommends to bend the limb from the ankle downwards, and to keep it in that situation by throwing the animal, when he thinks that a perfect cure might be made. There would, however, be considerable difficulty in keeping the limb in such a confined situation for so long a time as would be necessary to unite the ruptured tendon; and after all, there is the greatest probability that a very slight exertion would produce a fresh rupture.\n\nFractures of the bones may take place in any part of these animals, but they are most common in the feet of horses and the legs of dogs.\n\nThe navicular, coffin, and small pastern bones of a horse are not unfrequently fractured, and Mr Feron speaks of a small pastern bone being broken into seven pieces. It is not surprising that these bones should be broken, when we consider the immense weight that is generally sustained by them, and the great exertions which a horse sometimes makes to recover a fall.\n\nThese bones, when broken, will be united by a callus, provided that the limb be kept in such a situation as to prevent motion; but this can rarely be effected, even in cases where the bones of the foot are fractured, still less in those cases where a fracture of the larger bones has taken place.\n\nOne of the most common fractures of the bones in a horse is that of the ridge of the ilium, or haunch-bone, of the horse. This bone, from the projecting angle formed by its ridge, is peculiarly exposed to injury; and when the ridge is unusually prominent, as sometimes happens, or when the horse is more than commonly lean, the probability of fracturing this bone is still further increased.\n\nFractures of the haunch-bone may be occasioned by falls, by blows, which are often given by brutal riders and carters, with the butt end of a large whip, or perhaps a broomstick, and they are very commonly produced by striking the haunch violently against a post, or the edge of a wall, when the horse turns too sharply round a corner, or passes swiftly through a narrow gateway.\n\nIt may be ascertained that such an accident has taken place, by the pain the horse feels in the part, and where the fracture is considerable, by the cracking of the parts of the broken bone against each other, but still more certainly by an evident cavity of the haunch, from the depression of the ridge. The muscles of the belly in the upper part of the flank will appear sunk in, especially when the horse lies down, and will form a sort of hollow between the haunch and the ribs. The horse, when he attempts to move, will be as lame as if one of the bones of the leg were broken, owing to the extreme pain that motion excites in the muscles, that before being severely bruised, have lost one of their principal attachments.\n\nWhen an accident of this kind has happened, it is necessary to keep the animal perfectly at rest, as nothing but repose can produce a reunion of the fractured bone. The parts may be gently rubbed with some stimulating liniment, as in other cases of bruises, and some recommend the application of a charge, or strengthening plaster. It sometimes happens, where only a small part of the bone has been broken off, the horse completely recovers his former activity; but more commonly such a deformity is produced by the ridge of one haunch remaining lower than that of the other, and by the callus that forms between the end of the divided bone, as to render the horse more or less permanently lame.\n\nWhen the legs of a dog are broken, it is easy, by means of splints, to keep the limb in such a situation as to effect a union of the broken bone; and we have not unfrequently met with cases of this kind, where a complete cure has been effected in the course of a few weeks.\n\nThe ribs of a horse are sometimes broken, either by falls, or from the brutality of their keepers, as by striking them with the heavy handle of a whip or cudgel. If the end of the fractured rib does not penetrate into the chest, so as to wound the lungs, a cure may in general be readily effected, by fastening a bandage round the body over the seat of the fractured rib, and keeping the horse at rest and on a low diet.\n\nLuxations or dislocations of bones are exceedingly uncommon in the horse, owing to the great strength of the\nDiseases, the ligaments that surround the joints. These may, however, sometimes happen, and we are by no means of Mr Blane's opinion, that the immense strength of the muscles in a horse would prove any obstacle to the complete reduction of such a luxation. If, indeed, we endeavoured to reduce the luxation by pulling and hauling at the luxated limb, in order to overcome the power of the muscles, and thus produce a counter extension, which is still, we believe, the method generally employed by surgeons to fet a dislocated limb in the human body, we shall most certainly be disappointed. But if, instead of this vain attempt, we place the limb in such a situation as that the power of those muscles which are the antagonists of the muscles that keep the limb in its dislocated place, may be fairly exerted, there will probably be little difficulty in replacing the bone in its socket, as the very strength of the muscles will assist us in the operation.\n\n3. Lameness is very commonly the effect of tumours of the mucous bags or capsules, or of excrescences formed on the bones of the legs and feet, or on the hoof.\n\nIn most of the joints there are appendages or membranous bags, called bursae mucosae, or mucous bags, that are filled with a mucous fluid secreted into their cavities, for the purpose of afflicting the motions of the muscles and tendons near the joint. It often happens that these mucous capsules are enlarged, either from hard work, which is a very common cause of their enlargement, or from some injury done to the neighbouring parts. When the enlargement is but small, it is of little consequence, but when the bags become unusually distended, their size impedes the motion of the joints. These tumours have received different names among grooms and farriers, according to the place where they are seated.\n\nWind-galls. When the mucous bags that are situated near the paterns become enlarged, the tumours are called wind-galls.\n\nBog-spavin. When the enlargement takes place in the mucous bags on the inner side of the hock, the disease is called bog-spavin.\n\nThorough-pin. When the tumours are seated in the upper and back part of the hock, between the gemelli muscle and the tendons of the great flexor muscle of the foot, the affection is called thorough-pin.\n\nWhen the swelling is situated at that part where the tendon of the gemelli muscles is inserted into the point of the hock, it is called capulet or capped hock.\n\nOf all the various swellings, the wind-galls are the most likely to produce lameness, and next to them the bog-spavin. The capulet and thorough-pin are seldom of much consequence.\n\nIn the treatment of wind-galls and similar tumours, the object is to remove the unusual swelling, and to prevent its return. The swelling can be removed only by evacuating the contents of the tumour, or by promoting its absorption. The former was recommended by Dr Bracken, and appears to have been successful in a few cases. The tumour is opened with a sharp knife; and when the fluid has been evacuated, an echarotic substance composed of burnt alum, white vitriol, and red precipitate, is applied to the wound, to produce such a degree of inflammation as may contract its cavity. Probably firing would have a better effect. Mr Coleman and the alveus of the veterinary college, are much adverse to this operation, and certainly where it can be avoided it is not desirable. Absorption of the accumulated fluid may often be produced by the application of blisters, and other stimulating applications; but this is most certainly effected by producing pressure on the tumour, by means of a bandage applied round the part, with a bolster or compress immediately over the swelling. When the unusual enlargement has been reduced, its return is best prevented by firing the skin, so as to produce a considerable degree of contraction.\n\nHorses are subject to various excrescences on the splints, bones, or exostoses, as they are called, which, when they form near the joints, or below the tendons of the muscles, generally produce lameness. These excrescences have received various names, according to their situation. When they are formed about some part of the knee or cannon bone, they are generally called splints, though farriers often call the excrescences at the knee effeteles; and when there are two small bony enlargements near each other, they are called fuszes. The excrescences at the knee are not very common, and when they occur, are generally the effect of a wound; but splints about the cannon bone are very common, especially among young horses, owing to the blood-vessels in them being larger in proportion to the absorbents than in old horses; and hence the deposition of bony matter may, in certain cases of injury, be greater than what the absorbents are able to take up again. These excrescences are easily produced in young horses, by any blow or other injury that is capable of producing considerable inflammation; as striking part of the cannon bone which is the usual seat of splints in what is called the speedy cut, or by producing unusual pressure on one side more than on the other. Although a splint may not be in the neighbourhood of any material tendon, it may still produce lameness by the pain which it excites; but when it interferes with a tendon, or some important ligament, lameness must in general be the consequence.\n\nWhen an excrescence appears on any of the bones that enter into the formation of the hough, it is called vin Bone-spavin. It is most frequently found on the upper and inner part of the small metacarpal bone, or on some of the wedge-like bones on the inside of the hock. In the former situation it is often produced in consequence of the outer heel having been raised by calkins; and in what are called cat, cow, or flickle-hammed horses, it is often brought on by their natural deformity, though in these latter cases the excrescence is most commonly formed on the inside of the hock.\n\nAn excrescence situated on the back part of the hock towards its point, is called a curb. This is sometimes formed on the bone, but it is frequently only an unusual hardness and swelling of some of the ligaments.\n\nWhen an exostosis forms on the lesser patern bone, Ring-bone, producing a hard swelling round the coronet, it is called a ring-bone. A deposition of bone over the lateral cartilages is sometimes also called by the same name.\n\nThe treatment of all these excrescences is much the same, and our object must be, either to excite the absorbent vessels to increased action, so as to remove the bony excrescence, or to take this away by means of an operation. The former of these is not likely to be successful,\nDiseases, except in the early stage of the complaint, when the bony matter is not completely hardened. If the excrescence be discovered in time, blisters are to be applied over the part, and repeated frequently, and strong mercurial ointment, or an ointment composed of corrosive sublimate and blistering ointment, is to be applied over the part, and gentle friction should be frequently employed on those parts of the limb that are above and below the swelling. By these means the excrescences may sometimes be removed; but when they have become too hard, these stimulating applications will scarcely excite the absorbents to sufficient action. The only method to which we can then have recourse is an operation long ago practiced by the old farriers, apparently with considerable success. The bony excrescence is laid bare, by making an incision through the integuments, and then the excrescence is cut off by means of a sharp chisel struck by a mallet. After this the skin is to be laid down over the part, and we are to endeavour to heal the wound as soon as possible, by sticking plaster and a proper bandage. Firing is much employed by the French for the removal of ring-bones and other excrescences. Mr Lawrence recommends that in firing a ring-bone, the instrument employed should be thinner than usual, and that the lines described should not be more than one-fourth of an inch distant from each other, being crossed obliquely like a chain.\n\nSometimes an inflammation takes place on the lower part of the hoof, between the sensitive and horny soles, or between the outer crust and the binders, producing a slight effusion of blood, and leaving a considerable tenderness in the part. When the hoof is examined, after being perfectly cleaned, there is commonly seen a discoloured spot, sometimes red, but more usually blue, or blackish, like what is seen below one's nail, when the finger is jammed. The affection is commonly called by farriers a corn. (In Scotland, we believe it is called a stone-crust), though it is by no means similar to a corn in the human foot. Horny excrescences which might properly be called corns, are sometimes however produced on the horse's hoof; and of this nature, we suppose, were the corns on the feet of Giefar's horse.\n\nThis complaint is always owing to an improper pressure on the horny sole, by which the sensitive sole is squeezed between it and the coffin bone. Hence a quantity of blood is effused from the vessels of the sensitive sole, which, if it remains for any length of time, produces an unusual tenderness in that part of the hoof. Corns are generally produced by shoes that are too hollow next the hoof, so as to allow a stone to get between the shoe and the sole, and thus press upon the latter; or it may be produced by the shoe being made too short or too narrow, and thus indenting itself upon the sole between the binders and the crust.\n\nThe best manner of treating a corn appears to be, to remove that part of the sole which is immediately below the seat of the affection with a drawing knife, taking care not to cut farther than the seat of the effused blood; then to insert a pledget dipped in tincture of myrrh, into the opening. No pressure must be applied upon the part, and a piece of the shoe opposite the corn should be cut out, to prevent pressure from taking place. The horse must be allowed to stand quiet, on a level surface, and must not be worked till the horny part of the sole that has been cut away shall be renewed; and even then it would be proper to turn him to grass for some time, without shoes, or with very small tips of iron at the toes.\n\n4. Lameness may be produced by many injuries of the feet, brought on by hard work, bad shoeing, or other ill treatment.\n\nWhen horses are ridden hard on pavement, or hard dry roads, especially if the frog has been pared down, or even the crust cut away too much in shoeing, the battering produced on the hoof frequently brings on an inflammation of the sensitive part within. This may happen also to cart horses made to draw heavy loads, under similar circumstances.\n\nWhen the horse's hoof is not very delicate or tender, this battering sometimes only produces a stiffness, or swelling of the legs, and contraction of the sinews. This state is commonly called goggling, or a horse that has his feet thus battered, is said to be goggly.\n\nIf inflammation is excited within the hoof, a most Founder, painful species of lameness is produced commonly called founder, or the horse thus lamed is said to be foundered. The complaint is also called foot-founder, to distinguish it from a disease which we shall describe hereafter, and to which farriers sometimes give the name of body-founder. This inflammation may take place in any of the feet, or in all; but it is most commonly produced in the fore-feet: and as, from the pain which the horse experiences, he endeavours to throw as much as possible of his weight, upon his hind-feet, and appears unable to support himself on his fore-feet, he is said to be down before.\n\nThis complaint most commonly takes place in horses; but it may take place in cattle or sheep, brought on by hard driving, on hard stony roads, when sent to fairs, or markets. In these animals, however, the complaint seldom proceeds to such a height as in horses; and it is in them more easily relieved.\n\nThe symptoms of founder are thus described by Mr Feron. \"Foundered horses have a general stiffness of the fore-hand, attended with a considerable acute pain of the joints, ligaments, and muscles, connected with it. The pain which the animal suffers on moving the joints, obliges him to keep the flexor muscles in a constant relaxed state, which position ultimately produces an entire debility and stiffness of every joint which composes the fore extremity of the animal. If the horse has been neglected, or the disease so rapid in its progress that it cannot be removed, the symptoms will increase so rapidly, that in a very little time we may observe the cuticular veins become turgid and varicose, similar to the lymphatic enlargement in farcy. In this state, exercise considerably increases the pain and violence of the symptoms, the animal falls off his food, his health becomes very much impaired, and a general decay of the whole limbs, particularly observable in the extensor muscles of the fore-arm, soon renders the animal useless for activity.\"\n\nWhen the complaint affects the fore-feet, the horse throws his hind-feet as far forward as possible, which leads those who do not understand the nature of the complaint to suppose that the horse is affected with a weakness in his loins. When it is feated in the hind-feet the horse throws his body forwards, in order to relieve.\nlieve the hind-feet of their weight. In this case the horse is supposed to labour under an affection of the chest, which has been called chest-founder.\n\nThe complaint usually comes on very rapidly, and sometimes appears a few hours after hard riding, or after the application of other causes, that will immediately be mentioned.\n\nIt may be easily known that a horse is foundered, as he can scarcely walk on first coming out of the stable, and evidently labours under great pain. Like many other affections that produce lameness, the horse appears to be relieved by exercise, but this relief is only temporary; and exercise only tends to increase the disease.\n\nMr Feron says, that, on dissecting the feet of foundered horses, he has frequently found the membranes of the joints thicker than in their natural state, and sometimes a disposition to anchyloysis, or stiff joint; which in some of the joints was evidently observed.\n\nThe founder is very commonly produced by battering the hoofs on hard ground. It may be brought on by any causes, that are capable of exciting inflammation in the internal sensitive parts of the foot. It is frequently produced by washing the legs of a horse, while sweating; and according to Mr Feron this is so evident, that if we observe the horses belonging to public coaches, in whom this practice is very common, we shall see that fifteen out of twenty labour under the torture of this disease. Founder may also proceed from allowing the horse, while sweating and fatigued, to stand long in a cold, damp air.\n\nIn the treatment of founder, the great object is to remove the inflammation, which is best done by bleeding in the veins of the foot, and the application of blisters about the joints. The toe of the affected foot must be removed, and the toe of the crust may then be pared to the quick, in order to produce a discharge of blood from the vessels of the affected part. It will be proper to pare the whole of the crust as thin as possible, especially at the heels and quarters, in order to allow the frog to come in contact with the ground. Blisters are now to be applied round the fetlock, down to the foot. Mr Feron recommends immersing the feet in warm water 24 hours after blistering, keeping them there all day, and applying a large warm poultice of bran and water at night. Mr Blaine, on the other hand, advises the use of cold astringent lotions, as Goulard or sal ammoniac in vinegar. Sometimes the pain in the feet is so violent, that the horse can scarcely bear to support himself upon them, and indeed if he could remain quiet, it would be better to let him lie down. But if he proves restless, he may be partly supported by means of a sheet drawn round him, with its corners pulled up to the ceiling of the stable by pulleys, so as to let the horse's feet just touch the ground.\n\nThe horse must be kept rather low, and if the inflammation is very great, or if there is any fever, it will be proper to administer cooling remedies, such as the drenches marked 22 and 25 in the receipts. The belly must be kept moderately open, and all exercise must be avoided.\n\nSometimes after the inflammation has subsided, the lameness still continues. This may be owing to the formation of horny matter between the sensitive and horny sole. Mr Blaine recommends that this be removed by cutting away the horny sole; but we much doubt whether this operation would be attended with the desired effect.\n\nFounder, properly so called, can take place only in those animals that have horny hoofs; but a similar affection not unfrequently occurs in the feet of hounds, dogs, after a long and fatiguing chase. It consists in an inflamed state of the feet, produced by long running, especially over hard or stony ground. When the dogs come home their feet are hurt and swelled, inflamed, and sometimes cracked or chapped. The dog evidently feels considerable pain, and if he lies down for a little, he can scarcely be made to rise again. Dogs in this state are said to be flubbed in the feet, and are often so much lamed, that they cannot be taken out again for some days.\n\nWhen the inflammation is but slight, it requires but little attention, as the dog will himself allay the swelling and pain, by constant licking. When, however, the feet have been much bruised, the cracks pour out a bloody or purulent matter, and the case requires greater attention. The feet should first be bathed with warm water, and great care taken that no dirt or gravel be suffered to remain between the claws or in the cracks. After bathing, the feet may be rubbed with some digestive ointment, and a cold poultice composed of crumbs of bread well moistened with vinegar and water, should be tied round the affected foot.\n\nThe hoof of the horse frequently becomes lengthened, contracted, and contracted at the heels and quarters. This unnatural shape is commonly the effect of bad shoeing, by which the frog is deprived of the necessary pressure on the ground, and thus the heels are prevented from expanding, while the nails that are fixed in the quarters contribute to prevent expansion there, and thus the hoof is unnaturally lengthened at the toe. This contraction is considerably increased by the heat of ordinary stables; and by the evaporation that takes place from the hoof while the horse stands within doors, on account of the vacancy left below the frog, while the heels are elevated above the ground. Contraction of the hoof causes lameness, by producing an unnatural degree of pressure on the sensitive parts within, especially on the sensitive frog, which is not unfrequently inflamed in these cases.\n\nThe remedy for this defect is, to bring the frog gradually to press upon the ground, by lowering the heels; but as, in the very sensitive state to which the feet are commonly brought by contraction, it might be dangerous to apply pressure to the frog at once, it is advisable to lower the heels gradually, in the manner directed in No. 146. If the frog is much diseased, as sometimes happens, a bar shoe should be employed, by which means slight pressure may be made by fixing an iron plate from the heels of the shoe towards the toe. The best means of producing pressure in these cases would probably be to employ Mr Coleman's artificial frog. The upper part of the hoof should be rasped thin, especially at the quarters, as these parts of the hoof will then be more easily expanded by the motion of the lateral cartilages. The lower part of the hoof should also be kept moist, especially the frog.\n\nMr Blaine remarks, that dark-chestnut horses are more subject to contracted feet than others, and he relates a case of a mare belonging to himself, who had all her feet contracted. These he endeavoured to expand by\nDiseases by means of jointed shoes, furnished with a sliding bar, which was kept in its situation by means of pegs, so that in this way the heels of the shoe might be gradually widened, by moving the cross bar farther towards the toe. This method is very ingenious, but Mr Blaine acknowledges that it did not fully answer his purpose.\n\nWhen the heels have been gradually lowered so far, that the frog can bear the proper pressure, the horse should continue to wear a thin-heeled shoe; but if he is not required to be worked, it would be better to fend him out to graze without shoes, where the pasture is not too dry.\n\nIt often happens in cases of contracted feet, and in some other cases, when the frog does not receive the due degree of pressure, that a running takes place from the cleft of the horny frog, occasioned by a degree of inflammation which is followed by a secretion of purulent matter. This complaint is commonly called a running thrush. While it extends no farther than the horny frog, it is seldom attended with any serious consequences; but if it be neglected, the matter extends through the horny to the sensitive frog and sensitive sole, and produces canker or quitter.\n\nSome horses have naturally a running from the cleft of the frog; and so long as this is slight, and the parts are kept clean, it is of little consequence. We know there are some persons who conceive a slight running thrush, as rather beneficial to a horse, and do not esteem it as a mark of unkindness; but we cannot agree with these gentlemen in either particular, as, though the complaint does not in itself absolutely render a horse lame, so long as his feet are properly attended to, it will, if neglected, degenerate into a foul ulcer, the matter of which may easily penetrate into the internal parts of the foot. A running thrush is very commonly the consequence of bad grooming, and suffering dirt and gravel to lodge in the clefts of the frog, and it is still more frequently produced in the common method of shoeing, by cutting and paring away the frog.\n\nIn the treatment of a running thrush, the principal objects are, to remove the cause that first produced it, and to stop the discharge of purulent matter. The latter is easily effected by applying to the part some stimulating liniment. Mr Blaine recommends for this purpose a composition of two ounces of tar, with five drachms of vitriolic acid, which is to be applied hot every day, by pouring it into the cleft of the frog from a spoon. The discharge, though easily stopped in this way, will soon return, unless the proper degree of pressure be given to the frog; and this is to be brought about by proper attention to shoeing the horse with thin-heeled shoes, taking care that the heels be lowered gradually, and slight artificial pressure be made on the frog, till it is become sufficiently healthy to bear the natural pressure of the ground.\n\nWhen the matter of a running thrush infatuates itself upwards to the sensitive parts of the foot, it forms what is called canker, in which there is a considerable inflammation, producing a luxuriant unhealthy fungus, springing up from all the diseased surface that is exposed, and producing a great degree of tenderness, and what may be called a rottenness of the hoof. If this disease continues for any considerable time, it attacks the whole substance of the foot, extending to the tendons, ligaments, and bones, till at last the foot may absolutely drop off with disease. Mr Coleman considers canker as generally the effect of too much moisture applied to the foot or hoof.\n\nTo check the progress of a canker, the whole of the excrement that appears on the external part of the hoof, is to be cut away close to the surface from which it springs, and such parts of the horny sole as appear to be detached from the sensitive sole, should be removed, to prevent the matter from lodging in the internal parts. When the diseased part is fairly exposed to view, it is to be washed with a solution of some metallic caustic, such as nitrate of mercury, No. 49 of the receipts, or a solution of lunar caustic, in the proportion of a drachm to two ounces of soft water. This is best applied by moistening a pledget of lint or tow, and confining this upon the cankered surface, by applying a regular pressure by means of cross bars of iron introduced beneath the shoe. A continuance of these applications, while the frog is gradually exposed to pressure, will in general soon stop the progress of the disease, and when this is removed, the horny parts of the hoof that had been cut away will be gradually removed; and by shoeing the horse properly afterwards, the disease will be prevented from returning.\n\nCattle and sheep are subject to a disease very similar to canker in the horse, producing a discharge of fetid matter from between the claws of the hoof, or sometimes from only one claw.\n\nThis affection in cattle is commonly called the foul, or the cattle are said to be foul in the foot. Managers of cattle commonly divide this disease into two kinds, the foul, and the horny, which are said to require different modes of treatment. In the foul, a running of very offensive matter takes place from the heels, or between the claws of the hoof; and the animal appears exceedingly lame. The treatment in this case consists in cutting away all the soft and spongy parts, and then applying a caustic liquid, such as will presently be described, for the foot-rot in sheep. The parts are then to be covered with a pledget spread with mild ointment, or, what is very common among farmers, a piece of fat bacon may be wrapped round the part, tied on the foot, and suffered to remain for two or three days. In the mean time the animal should stand very clean, and be allowed to rest as much as possible.\n\nThe horny foul seems to be very analogous to corns in horses. The animal is very lame, and, on examining the foot, the hoof feels very hot, and, when hard pressed, the beast evidently feels much pain. There will commonly be found some part of the horn penetrating into the softer parts of the foot, either at the heel, or between the hoofs. In the treatment it is necessary to cut away these parts of the horn, as well as any part under which there appears much inflammation. For this purpose, it will probably be necessary to castrate the animal, but care should be taken that he be thrown on a soft place. After the hoof has been pared away, a rag moistened with vinegar and water should be tied on, and the animal must be sent to graze in a soft smooth pasture. If the inflammation and pain are very great, it may be necessary to bleed from the veins of the foot.\n\nFoot-rot in sheep is called the foot-root, and is generally produced by their being kept on a wet soil. It is remarkable that salt marshes do not produce it. According\nto Mr Lawrence, frequent travelling to and from the fold, or by fiddling ewes from the hot dung of a sheep-house, will occasion it. Some are of opinion, that it originates from the same cause which occasions chilblains in the human feet; and this opinion is maintained in the essay on the diseases of sheep, affixed to Mr Findlater's Survey of Peebles, where it is stated, that the remote cause of the disease is weakness, and the immediate cause cause cold and wet, as standing in cold weather upon wet pastures, with the feet constantly soaked in water. Dr Wilkinson of Enfield considers moisture as the predisposing cause, and has found the disease to be produced from the sheep continuing in long grails during a mild winter. The same cause generally, although perhaps gradually, operates upon the whole flock, and then it has been supposed that the disease is contagious. The late Lord Somerville had a piece of pasture which always produced the foot-rot on any sheep that were put into it; but the disease was entirely prevented or rooted out by a careful selection of the sheep in order, by paring the hoofs of those that began to be affected, and by the use of caustics not too corrosive. These appeared to be the most proper means of stopping the complaint, and the best caustic application is said to be the nitrate of mercury. It is evident, that, during the application, the hoofs of the sheep should be kept as clean as possible. Whether its greater or less prevalence depends on the less or greater attention paid to the sheep, is not perhaps fully ascertained. It is, however, certain that the sheep of some districts are entirely free from it. We are informed, that in Tweeddale the complaint is scarcely known.\n\nThere is a disease in the horse's foot, in which the coffin-bone is forced backwards, and made to press unnaturally upon the heels, by which its edges being subjected to unusual pressure, become partly absorbed. Hence this bone losing its support, becomes pressed in its concave part, where inflammation is produced, and bony matter is thrown out, rendering the lower part of the coffin-bone convex instead of concave, and the sole is rendered unusually thin. This disease is called pumiced feet, and may be brought on in three ways; from improper shoeing, from inflammation, as in case of founders, and from a natural defect in the foot itself. It is said to be very common in wet soils. It is very commonly produced by applying the shoe red-hot to the horse's foot. Its immediate cause appears to be an inflammation of the sensitive laminae, by which a quantity of coagulated lymph or of bony matter is thrown out, that forces back the coffin-bone in the manner above described. When the disease is completely formed, it does not appear capable of being radically cured, but only admits of palliation. Mr Blaine recommends, that the growth of the sole should be encouraged by every means, but the foot should not be kept improperly moist. The best means would be, the turning the horse out without shoes in a dry pasture. No part of the heels or sole should be removed in this case, as the parts are already too slight. A shoe should be formed, if possible, that presents a hollow surface to the foot, and a plain one to the ground. This may be done, by making it of rather an increased thickness, which will admit of its being hollowed within, and bevelled from the outer to the inner edge of the web.\n\nSometimes perpendicular fissures or cracks are seen in the hoof extending between the fibres in a parallel direction from above downwards. These are called sand-cracks, and generally take place near the quarter, more frequently on the outer than the inner side, and oftener in the fore than the hind foot. These cracks sometimes come on suddenly, and then generally denote a contraction of the hoof. They are also said to have arisen from a wound in the vessel or part of the coronary ligament, bringing on a secretion of horny matter, which gets between the fibres of the hoof, and causes them to separate.\n\nThe means of preventing the crack from extending, are to thin the hoof where the crack has taken place as much as possible, and to make a transverse section a little way across at the upper part. If the crack should still continue to gape, it must be carefully covered, and the hoof bound round, so as to close it as much as may be, and the portion of the crust that rests on the shoe should be chambered away a little, by which means the divided parts will be more likely to come together.\n\nWhen a wound has been inflicted on the coronet, the coronary ligament commonly becomes injured, and its vascular part does not secrete so much bony matter as usual. Hence there is a space left between the old horny matter of the hoof, and the new that is formed from other parts; and this produces what is commonly called a false quarter. A false quarter may also be produced, in consequence of a quitter extending upwards through the coronet. As the sensitive laminae within the hoof are liable to be pressed in this vacant space between the horny edges, thus causing violent pain, the false quarter is attended with a lameness of the worst kind; for as this interference of the lamina sometimes takes place suddenly, while the animal is in motion, the pain makes him shrink, and he not unfrequently comes down.\n\nThe only way of remedying this defect is, to excite such an action in the coronary ligament as may dispose it to throw out new horny matter, and thus fill up the vacant space. This is best effected by removing the surrounding horn, and applying blisters to the coronet, while the part of the hoof that is opposed to the shoe should be hollowed away as much as possible, to admit of the separated parts approaching each other.\n\nWhen a horse in motion, especially in trotting, brings Cutting one foot so near another as to interfere, and thereby graze or wound one of the feet, he is said to cut. Sometimes the feet of a horse are in this way feverishly wounded, and temporary lameness is produced. In cutting, the horse may either wound the heels of the fore feet, with the toe, or side of the hind shoe, which is the most common case; or he may wound the fore part of the hind-foot, just above the hoof, by striking it against the heel of the fore shoe; or, lastly, he may bring two of the feet so closely together, as to wound the inner side of either.\n\nCutting may arise from a bad habit, or from a natural deformity of the feet, but it is very commonly the consequence of bad shoeing. When horses cut from turning out their toes, which is by much the most common cause, they are observed to have the inner quarter of the hoof lower than the outer, and the fetlock joints are thus nearer each other than those of horses which have their limbs straight. These facts led farriers to a conclusion, that if the inner quarters were raised to a level with the outer, and especially if made even\neven higher, the fetlock joints would be thrown further apart, so that the foot would pass the supporting leg without striking; Accordingly, it has been usual to make the inner quarter of the shoe higher than the outer, and this has been the common practice for a long time. Mr Morecroft, by making trial of a shoe, of a shape the reverse of what we have described, namely, having the outer quarter thick, and the inner thin, completely prevented cutting in the horse, on whom those shoes were tried, and the utility of the improvement has been confirmed by succeeding trials. According to Mr Blaine, the principle on which this is supposed to act is, that when a horse is at rest, he supports his weight equally on both feet; but, having his inner quarter much raised, in the common mode of attempting to remedy the defect of cutting, when one foot is elevated he must be supported obliquely on the other, and hence have a tendency to fall outwards; to prevent which he brings the moving foot nearer the supporting one, by which he strikes it. Considering it in this point of view, it is not difficult to account for our author's mode of reasoning on his method, which, by elevating the outer instead of the inner side of the supporting foot, must necessarily give it a disposition to lean inwards, and fall to the inside, which will throw the moving further from the supporting foot. But, ingenious as this mode of reasoning may be, it is to be feared, that by thus throwing an increase of weight on the inner side, we shall sometimes be in danger of producing evils, that will counterbalance the prevention of cutting.\n\nLameness may be produced by any one of the causes that we have mentioned, but it may happen that a combination of two or more of these causes takes place at the same time in different parts of the same limb: thus the foot may be pricked with a nail, and a strain may take place, nearly at the same time, in the sinews of the leg, or the ligaments of the joints; for the pain excited by the nail first makes the horse trip or stumble, and then, his making a sudden exertion to save himself, or ease the pricked foot, a strain of the ligaments or sinews frequently takes place. A similar complication is often produced in a horse that is affected with spavin, or other bony excrecences, as his exertion to save the limb that feels painful from the rubbing of the muscles or tendons against the spavin, may produce a severe strain in the muscles of the shoulder.\n\nAs the causes of lameness are so various, and the real seat of it frequently very obscure, a practitioner should be extremely cautious how he gives a decisive opinion with respect to either, before he has well examined the parts where lameness may take place, and enquired into every circumstance that may assist him in forming his opinion. For want of such precaution, and from a superficial examination of the part that is supposed to be the seat of the affection, egregious blunders and dangerous mistakes are not unfrequently committed, and applications have been made to parts that are really found, when it is afterwards discovered, to the confusion of the practitioner, that the real cause of the lameness was in a different place. Nothing is more common than for ordinary farriers to apply their liniments and embrocations to the shoulder, when in fact the affection that causes the lameness is located in the feet.\n\nAs, perhaps, in nine cases out of ten, the foot is the part that has received the injury, this should first be examined with the strictest attention, the hoof should be made perfectly clean, especially in its under surface, to see whether there be any crack or fissure, any discolouration, any particular heat, &c. The pastern and all round the coronet should be also carefully inspected; and, if nothing is found, the examination should be repeated next day, or even a third time. The foot is more particularly to be suspected of being the seat of the complaint, when the lameness makes its appearance soon after the horse has been shod, or has had his hooves fastened; as the foot may be lamed by a nail in floeing, though the point of the nail has not penetrated to the quick. The nail may be so thick, or may pass near the quick, as to press in a small part of the hoof upon the soft parts, thus producing exquisite pain, and perhaps inflammation. It is therefore proper always to remove the shoe from the foot of the affected limb, and if the cause of lameness is not very evident to wait a few days, to see whether the removal of the shoe has produced any alteration for the better.\n\nNo certain rule can be laid down for judging of the seat of lameness from the motion of the affected limb, though this is considered by some as one of the surest marks. The deranged motion in one part of the limb very commonly arises from sympathy with another part that is the real seat of the affection.\n\nWe have now, we believe, mentioned all the important cases of lameness, except the firing-halt, or click-spavin. This is an affection of the hind quarters, producing a sudden jerking of the legs upwards, when the horse attempts to move. It appears to be a nervous affection, and seems to be somewhat analogous to the chorea, or St Vitus's dance, in children. We do not know that this affection has ever been cured, but it is said that it may be palliated by allowing the horse to run much at large, and letting him remain untied in a large stable. Mr Lawrence recommends that, after a hard day's work, both hind legs be immersed in a warm bath up to the hocks, and kept there as long as the water continues warm, when they are to be rubbed perfectly dry, and the same bath and rubbing repeated in the morning. He also advises anointing the back sinews, and about the hocks, with strong camphorated ointment.\n\nWe have occasionally, in this and the preceding chapters, spoken of abscesses and ulcers, and their treatment; and we can add little here on that subject, as it will be fully treated of in the article Surgery; and the instructions to be there laid down will apply nearly as properly to the inferior animals as to man. We may just remark, that foul ulcers, and such as do not heal kindly, are perhaps more common in some of the inferior animals than in man; and hence they require in the former applications of a more stimulating nature, to excite a proper degree of healthy action in the ulcerated part. There are a few particular ulcers which call for consideration in this article, and we cannot, perhaps, treat of them in any part of the treatise more properly than under the morbid affections of motion.\n\nThere sometimes takes place an inflammation, and consequent suppuration in the mucous capsules, at the articulation of the head with the first vertebra of the neck, near the insertion of the cervical ligament. This affection is commonly called the poll-evil. It is almost always\nDiseases. always the consequence of an injury done to the back of the head, by a horse's hanging back in his collar, by striking his head against the rack or manger; and is very frequently produced by a blow given on the head by brutal coachmen or carters. An ulcer in this part is often very difficult to heal, and when it extends beyond the skin, the matter sometimes infuses itself below the ligament of the neck, and on each side of it, and it not unfrequently produces a caries or rottenness of the vertebrae. The cure of the poll-evil is most easily effected when the inflammation is first discovered, before suppuration takes place; as, when once matter is formed, it commonly produces sinuses in the loose cellular substance about that part of the head, and these are not easily healed. When, therefore, we have reason to suppose that inflammation has begun in the skin of this part of the neck, every means must be employed to prevent its progress towards suppuration. A blister should be immediately applied over the part, and when this has done its duty, a solution of sal ammoniac in vinegar, or vinegar and water, should be applied by means of a cloth kept constantly wet. If a suppuration appears inevitable, it must be encouraged by fomenting the part frequently with warm water, or by the repeated application of warm poultices; and when the swelling appears sufficiently ripe, it must be opened, which is best done by introducing a feton from the highest to the most depending part of the tumour, as directed in No. 173. The cord of the feton must be examined every day, wiped dry, and rubbed with a little digestive ointment, and the sore should be carefully excluded from the air.\n\nIf the suppuration has proceeded any length, before it is discovered, there will probably be a number of sinuses, or pipes, as they are called, with matter lodging in each. If it can be easily effected, it would be proper to lay these open, and make them communicate with each other, or, if their direction can be ascertained, a feton may be passed through each. When a proper opening has been made for the matter, and care taken that none of it lodges, the sore will soon heal, by the application of the proper stimulating ointments.\n\nIt is sometimes necessary to employ the knife in this case; but when this is done, the greatest care should be taken not to wound the ligament, or, as the farriers call it, the fix-fax of the neck. The best method of avoiding this is, to have the animal's head fastened very high to the rack, by which the ligament will be more slack, and the finger can be easily introduced below it, so as to be a guide to the knife.\n\nWe mentioned in No. 341, the chafing of the back with the saddle. There is another injury of a similar kind, that is often suffered by the withers, from the saddle being allowed to press on them too long. This pressure and rubbing sometimes produces an inflammatory swelling, which, if it be not soon discovered, goes on to suppuration, and produces a sore which farriers call fistulous withers, or a fistula in the withers. This is also a very troublesome ulcer, as the matter sometimes penetrates below the shoulder, and makes its way down the bones of the fore leg; or, by infusing itself among the vertebrae of the back, renders them carious. The treatment in this case is much the same as in the last; the inflammation should be disinfected as soon as possible, and if matter forms, it should be evacuated by means of fetons. It is frequently required to pass a feton through the tumour on each side of the withers, in order to produce a proper inclination of the orifice, to carry off the matter. When sinuses form, they must be opened, as in the case of poll-evil.\n\nThere is sometimes a species of ill-disposed ulcers in the external part of the ears of dogs, very difficult to heal. It is generally called conker. These, when they heal, leave hardened edges, which frequently break out again in the course of a few months. The best application in this case is lunar caustic applied to the edges, to encourage them to slough off; but if this should not be found sufficient, the best remedy will be to tear off the diseased parts with a red-hot knife, or they may be cut off by a simple incision.\n\nChap. III. Morbid Affections of Digestion.\n\nIn order that the food may be well digested, when received into the stomach, it is necessary that it undergo the previous operation of chewing; unless it be of such a nature, as to be easily soluble in the gastric juice, without this previous preparation. The latter is the case only with dogs, whose food consisting almost entirely of animal matter, requires little or no chewing. But the food of horses, sheep, and cattle in general, requires to be well chewed, either when first swallowed, or in sheep and cattle by subsequent rumination.\n\nThe mouth in these animals is sometimes swollen, sore-mouths or otherwise affected with sores or cracks, that it is with difficulty the animals can chew their food. Sometimes there are bloody chinks or chops in the palate, occasioned by thistles or other prickly plants, which are mixed with the hay, or grow up among the grass. These should be washed on their first appearance with salt and vinegar, applied by means of a rag tied to a stick. If neglected, these chops frequently become inflamed and ulcerated. If pimples arise, they must be opened when they begin to suppurate, by means of a pointed cautery. There are sometimes found within-side the lip of cart horses and other ordinary cattle, soft tumours, or pustules with black heads, which are called giggers, bladders, or flips in the mouth. They do not always occasion much inconvenience, but sometimes they grow to a large size, so as to grow troublesome, and prevent chewing. When this is the case, they must be removed, either by fattening a thread about their roots, as directed in the treatment of warts, where they are of such a form as to admit of a ligature; or by the knife, applying afterwards the hot iron or cautery. In performing this operation, care must be taken to draw the tongue to one side, so that it may not be wounded. After removing these excrescences with the knife and cautery, the mouth may be washed with a solution of white vitriol or alum. Excrescences of a similar kind, called barbs or paps, sometimes grow below the tongue, and must be removed where practicable by means of ligature, as it is dangerous to employ the knife. When these excrescences are neglected, there sometimes arise in the mouth little ulcers with white specks, very similar to the aphthous crusts that form in the human mouth. It is recommended by some writers to use the cautery on these occasions; but probably a detergent lotion, such as we have just recommended, will answer the purpose of removing them.\nThe mouth or tongue of horses sometimes wounded with the bit or curb. When this happens, a lotion made with alum dissolved in water, and sweetened with honey, may be employed; and the bit should not be used again till the mouth is healed.\n\nMany veterinary writers have described the disease in the horse's mouth called the lampas, which is stated to be an inflammation and swelling of the first bar of the mouth in a young horse, so as to prevent his chewing. We believe that Lafaute and Dr Brecken were the first to deny the existence of such a complaint, which is now generally discredited among most of our modern writers. We have no doubt that such a swelling may take place; but it can scarcely be attended with the ill consequences commonly attributed to it, or require such vigorous treatment as is usually recommended.\n\nIt may happen, that any of these animals shall have a difficulty of swallowing, from various causes; either from an unusual narrowness in the gullet, or from the morse attempted to be swallowed being too large. The latter very frequently happens to cattle who are fed upon turnips or potatoes; and the choking thus produced sometimes proves very dangerous, as, if the obstruction is not speedily removed, the animal will die for want of breath. The method commonly employed among country farmers for unchoaking cattle, as they term it, is to thrust down the throat a large stiff rope, ravelled at the end, and well greased. This often succeeds, but it is a clumsy method; and if the rope, by having been long used, or becoming dry, should lose its stiffness, it will be bent in endeavouring to force down the obstruction; or, if the ravelled end be not pretty large, or the obstructing morse of an irregular shape, the rope may pass between the side of the gullet and the obstruction, without this being removed. Several intelligent farmers have therefore laid aside the use of the rope, and have contrived an instrument similar to the probang employed by surgeons. An instrument of this kind has been already mentioned, in the description of Mr Hunter's feeding byre in No. 236. An account of one that appears to us to be more useful and ingenious, has been communicated to us by the reverend Charles Findlater, minister of Newlands in Tweeddale. It is the contrivance of Mr Charles Alexander, a farmer in Mr Findlater's neighbourhood, and has long been employed by him for the purpose of relieving choked cattle. The following is Mr Alexander's construction of his instrument, as politely described to us by Mr Findlater.\n\nTake three small canes, of the thickness of the little finger, or thereabouts, of the length of 5 feet, that they may reach down the throat, and into the stomach of the largest ox. These canes are to be bound together by strong smooth twine rolled tightly about them (the circles of the twine touching each other), from top to bottom. Bees wax is then to be rubbed along the twine, to fill up any inequalities, and the whole rod is to be well oiled before it is used. There is a round knob at each end, the larger 2\u00bd inches in diameter for larger cattle; the other less for lesser cattle. These knobs are formed of the twine rolled hard, and when formed may be strengthened in their position, by being sewed by means of a shoemaker's awl or brog, and a waxed bristle thread, such as they employ. The thread knobs are made tapering up the canes from their broad extremity; but it must be remarked that the surface of this extremity is not rounded like a clue, but hollowed into the form of a cup. The intention of this hollowed form is, to make certain of catching hold of the obstructing body; as, if the knob was round, it might pass by it. After the knobs are formed, they are covered with soft leather, which by its flexibility will adapt itself to the hollow end of the knob as soon as it reaches an obstacle. The knobs must be securely fixed to the canes, for if they fall off, they leave an indigestible substance in the stomach. Such is Mr Alexander's probang, the only improvements on which that we would advise are, to make the knobs of sponge, firmly fastened to the canes, by passing twine through holes bored in them, and adding at each end two or three bights of twine, for the purpose of catching hold of any obstacle, thus making the instrument almost exactly like a surgeon's probang. We think the sponge preferable to the twine, as it will not be so liable to injure the animal's throat by its hardness, will adapt itself more readily to the form of the obstacle, and may be more firmly fixed to the canes.\n\nWhen cattle are put into a field of young clover, or rich grass, especially if they have previously been kept over-fed on poor or dry fodder, they are apt to eat voraciously or fog of their new repast, and the young succulent food, when sickened, received into the stomach, soon ferments, and produces such a quantity of air, as to swell the stomach to a violent and dangerous degree. Cattle thus affected are said to be over-fed, hove, or blown; or the affection of the stomach thus produced, is called over-feeding, or sometimes fog-ficking. If not speedily relieved, the animal's stomach not unfrequently bursts, from the inability to evacuate the accumulated air; for there seems, in these cases, to be a constriction of the gullet, so that the air cannot escape upwards, while the number of stomachs, and the spasmodic contraction produced by the unusual diffusion, prevents its passage by the anus.\n\nThe necessity of speedily relieving the animal, prompted the employment of what must at first have been considered as a very desperate remedy; namely, stabbing the animal. An opening is made with a sharp penknife into the paunch, in the thin part between the last rib and the huckle bone; and through this the air rapidly escapes. Sometimes the barrel of a quill is inserted into the wound, to prevent its closing before all the air that is produced during the fermentation of the food, has escaped.\n\nStabbing the animal, is a remedy that should not be had recourse to, but on the most urgent necessity; as the wound can seldom be made with such nicety as not to wound some important organ, especially some large blood-vessel. Indeed frequently the diffusion of the stomach, and consequently of the skin and muscles of the belly, is so great, that the moment the knife is introduced, a dreadful rent takes place, producing such a wound, as may be attended with fatal consequences.\n\nHappily this operation is not often necessary, as it is found that the administration of some internal stimulating medicines will check the fermentation of the green fodder, and promote the absorption of the extracted air. Many farmers have for some time given tar with this intention, administering an egg shell full to each beast; of late, however, the use of ardent spirits has been introduced, and it is found that a pint or mutchkin of\nof whisky or gin, mixed with an equal quantity of water, is the most efficacious remedy. Laudanum has also been recommended, but probably it is not superior to common spirits (D).\n\nIt has been the practice with some farmers, to introduce on these occasions, the common rope employed in cases of choking, into the stomach, and move it up and down, so as to produce a gradual evacuation of the air; but we should suppose that the evacuation produced in this way must be extremely slow.\n\nDr Monro senior, professor of anatomy in the university of Edinburgh, some years ago contrived an elastic tube, that might be introduced down the throat into the stomach of the animal, and thus speedily and effectually evacuate the air. A description of this instrument, and the manner of employing it, appeared in an Edinburgh newspaper, we believe, with the doctor's authority. It has since been published in a popular treatise on the diseases of black cattle, entitled \"Rowlin's Complete Cow-Doctor,\" from which we have taken it.\n\nThe doctor begins by observing, that the swelling of the belly is owing to the distention of the stomachs by fixed air, disengaged from the succulent grass in consequence of fermentation, the discharge of which by the mouth seems to be prevented by spasmodic contraction of the upper orifice of the stomach. He concludes that the cattle may with certainty be saved, if the air be drawn off in due time, without injuring the stomach and bowels; and he affirms that this may be done with great ease by passing a flexible tube down the gullet into the stomach.\n\nThe tube is to be composed of iron wire, as large as a common stocking wire, or about one sixteenth part of an inch diameter, twisted round a smooth iron rod, three eighths of an inch diameter, in order to give it a cylindrical form; and after taking it off the rod, it is to be covered with smooth leather.\n\nTo the end of the tube, which is intended to be passed into the stomach, a brass pipe, two inches long, of the same size as the tube, and pierced with a number of large holes, is to be firmly connected.\n\nTo prevent the tube from bending too much, within the mouth or gullet, in time of passing it down into the stomach, an iron wire, one eighth of an inch diameter, and of the same length as the tube, is put within it, which is to be withdrawn, when the tube has entered the stomach.\n\nHe has found that the space from the fore teeth of the under jaw, to the bottom of the first stomach of a large ox, measures about five feet, and he has passed such a tube, five feet and nine inches long into the gullet and stomach of a living ox. The tube ought therefore to be five feet long, that we may be sure of its answering in the largest oxen.\n\nAfter the tube is passed into the stomach, it may be allowed to remain for any length of time; as when it is pressed to one side of the throat, it does not intercept the breathing of the animal. The greatest part of the elastic and condensed fixed air, will be readily discharged through the tube; and if it be thought necessary, the remainder of it, or the superfluous drink, may be sucked out, by a bellows fixed to the upper end of the tube, with a couple of valves, one at its muzzle, and the other at the side of it, so disposed as to allow the air to pass in the direction from the stomach upwards.\n\nBy means of such a tube, the air is not only more certainly discharged than by stabbing the animal; but the dangers avoided which the stabbing occasions, not so much by the irritation which the wound creates, as that the air, and the other contents of the stomach, getting into the cavity of the belly, between the containing parts and the bowels, excite such a degree of inflammation as frequently proves fatal to the animal. This tube may be also useful for the purpose of introducing stimulant medicines into the stomach, when the contraction at the upper orifice would prevent their being given without some such contrivance.\n\nAn instrument of this kind is sold in London, at Macdougall's, No. 15, Great Wind-Mill Street. It should be made of various sizes, for sheep, as well as cattle. According to Mr Blaine, Mr Eagles of Graffham farm, near Guildford, has simplified this mode of relief much, by the invention of an instrument, for which he was rewarded by the Society for the encouragement of Arts, with fifty guineas. This is simply a cane of considerable diameter, and five feet in length for oxen; to which is affixed a knob of wood, at the end to be introduced into the stomach. That for sheep is considerably smaller, and three feet long. This instrument, for its simplicity, is much to be preferred, as it is found to occasion the evacuation of the air as effectually as the other. In cases of emergency, and in a judicious hand, the flexible part of a common cart whip might answer the end.\n\nFlatulence may be produced in horses, by eating greedily of rich food, to which they have been unaccustomed, or after having fasted long; especially if they drink much water immediately after. A horse in this state should not be taken out to work, as, from the distention of the stomach, there is danger of injuring the horse's wind, or even in some cases of bursting the stomach. If the distention has not proceeded to a great length, and if the horse is not colicive, gentle friction on the belly, and administering a ball made of some of the cordial seeds, will generally procure relief; but if the complaint proceeds to a great height, and there is gripping pain, attended with coliciveness, it becomes a case of flatulent colic; the descriptions and treatment of which will be considered in the next section.\n\nWhen this flatulence comes to a great height, it affects the disease that is commonly called acute indigestion. It very commonly arises from the horse eating voraciously, after having been kept without food for many hours; especially if the food then given him be of a flatulent kind, such as grains or draft, young sweet grass, clover, or the like. The horse's stomach being naturally small, is easily distended by an unusual quantity of food, or by the air disengaged from such as easily runs into fermentation. Hence arise swelling and tightness of the stomach, and acute pain. The horse discontinues eating,\n\n(D) The use of spirits in these cases was, we believe, first introduced by Dr Whytt of Edinburgh, who was in the habit of administering a pint (mutchkin) of gin on these occasions.\nDiseases eating, holds out his head, and appears exceedingly \ndefrefted; he looks anxiously and mournfully at his \nside, stamps with his feet, and breaks out into cold \nsweat. If he is not soon relieved, the head becomes \naffected, and there appear evident marks of preflure on \nthe brain. Symptoms very similar to those of flaggers \nfollow, and the horse commonly dies apopleptic, or the \nstomach bursts.\n\nAs this affection is so dangerous, immediate relief is \nnecessary. Stimulant medicines, such as are called car-\nminatives, as oil of anifeeds, effence of peppermint, \nor oil of turpentine, should be immediately admini-\nstered; and if there appears much determination of blood \nto the head, which may be known by a swelling and \nheaviness of the eyes, and the violent throbbing of the \narteries of the temples, it will be necessary to draw \nblood pretty largely by opening one of these arteries. \nIf the horse is bound in the belly, he must be raked, \nand have a strong purgative clyster with some aromatic \nsubstance in it, as anifeeds, or caraway seeds.\n\nAll these animals may occasionally swallow poison, \nand the treatment in these cases must depend in a great \nmeasure on the nature of the poisonous substance, where \nthis can be ascertained. It is seldom that a horse, cow, \nor sheep is poisoned; but in the dog, this may frequently \nhappen, either from accidents, or design. Dogs often \npick up nux vomica, (which is the poison mostly used \nby warreners,) and which usually causes convulsive fits, \nand soon kills. Apply immediately the following reme-\ndy. As much common salt as can be got down; hold \nthe head upwards, and force open the mouth, and by \nfixing a stick across, prevent its shutting, whilst the \nthroat is filled with salt; a sufficient quantity to purge \nand vomit will soon dissolve, and be swallowed; the \nstomach once cleared by a free passage obtained by stool, \nwarm broth should frequently be given to prevent the \nfaintness which might otherwise prove fatal. Two \ntable spoonsfuls of eufor oil, added to the salt, would \nvery much accelerate its action downwards.*\n\nArsenic is frequently given to dogs by design, or it \nmay be picked up by them in places where it has been \nlaid for rats. If the accident is discovered soon, the \ndog may sometimes be recovered by giving him a vomit \nof white vitriol, and drenching him well with \nsweet oil and milk; and when most of the poison ap-\npears to have been thrown up, the rest may probably be \nrendered harmless by repeated doses of liver of sul-\nphur.\n\nIf a horse is poisoned, the danger is very great, as \nfrom his inability to vomit, the stomach cannot be clear-\ned of the poison. But fortunately this accident scarcely \never happens; as arsenic, the most common poisonous \nsubstance, will produce little effect on the horse, unless \ngiven in a very large dose.\n\nThe stomach and bowels of all these animals may be \ninfected by worms, but they are most common in the \nhorse and dog.\n\nThe worms that most commonly infect the horse are \nwhat are commonly called the bots. They are not pro-\nperly worms, but are the larvae of several species of the \nOefirus or Gadfly mentioned in No. 337.\n\nThe horse is attacked by 2 or 3 species of Oefirus, but \nmore especially by the Oe. equi, which deposits its eggs \nin such a manner as that they shall be received into the \nanimal's stomach, where they form the bots.\n\nThe method pursued by the parent fly, in order to \nlay its eggs in the most favourable situation for being \nreceived into the stomach of the horse, is extremely \ncurious. It is thus related by Mr. Bracey Clark, who \nappears to have witnessed the process.\n\n\"When the female has been impregnated, and the \neggs are sufficiently matured, she seeks among the horses' \na subject for her purpose, and approaching it on the \nwing, she holds her body nearly upright in the air, and \nher tail, which is lengthened for the purpose, carried in-\nwards and upwards. In this way she approaches the \npart where she designs to deposit the egg, and suspending \nherself for a few seconds before it, suddenly darts \nupon it, and leaves the egg adhering to the hair, by \nmeans of a glutinous liquor secreted with it. She then \nleaves the horse at a small distance, and prepares a second \negg, and poising herself before the part, deposits it in \nthe same way. The liquor dries, and the egg becomes \nfirmly glued to the hair. This is repeated by various \nflies, till four or five hundred eggs are sometimes de-\nposited on one horse. The skin of the horse is always \nthrown into a tremulous motion on the touch of this \ninsect, arising from the very great irritability of the skin \nand muscles at that season of the year, occasioned by the \ncontinual teasing of the flies. The inside of the knee is \nthe part on which these flies seem to prefer depositing \ntheir eggs, and next to this the side, and back part of \nthe shoulder. It is curious that these parts are what are \nmost exposed to be licked by the animal. In licking, \nthe eggs adhere to the animal's tongue, and are carried \ninto the stomach with the saliva.\n\n\"The bots attach themselves to every part of the \nhorse's stomach, but are usually more numerous about its \nfarther orifice, and are sometimes, though less frequently, \nfound in the bowels. Their number varies considera-\nbly; sometimes there are not above half a dozen; at \nothers they exceed 100. They most usually hang in \nclusters, fixed by the small end to the inner membrane \nof the stomach, to which they adhere by means of two \nsmall hooks.\n\n\"The body of the larva is composed of eleven seg-\nments, all of which, except the two last, are surrounded \nwith a double row of horny bristles, directed towards the \ntruncated end, and are of a reddish colour, except the \npoints, which are black. These larvae evidently receive \ntheir food at the small end by a longitudinal aperture \nwhich is situated between the two hooks or tentacula. \nThe lips of this aperture appear somewhat hard, horny, \nand irregular.\n\n\"Their food is probably the chyle, which, being nearly \npure aliment, may go wholly to the composition of \ntheir bodies without any excrementitious residue, though \non dissection the intestine is found to contain a yellow \nor greenish matter, which is derived from the colour of \ntheir food, and shows that the chyle as they receive it is \nnot perfectly pure.\n\n\"The growth of their growth and the purity of their \nfood must occasion, what they receive in a given time \nto be proportionally small; from which probably arises \nthe extreme difficulty there is found in destroying them \nby any medicine or poison thrown into the stomach. \nAfter opium had been administered to a horse labouring \nunder a case of locked jaw for a week, in doses of one \nounce every day, on the death of the animal I have \nfound the bots in the stomach perfectly alive. Tobacco\nhas been employed in much larger quantities in the same complaint, and has been also longer continued, without destroying them. They are also but rarely affected by the draff purgatives, which bring away in abundance the Tenia and Ascarides.\"\n\nMr Clark does not apprehend they are so very injurious to the horses as is generally conceived. When removed from the stomach a deep impression remains where they adhered, but whether they ever irritate it so as to bring on a fatal spasm of the stomach itself, or of the pylorus, or, by collecting round this passage, prevent the food from entering the intestine, has never been investigated with sufficient accuracy. The ignorant surmise of farriers on opening the stomach after death, and being presented with so singular an appearance as the bots, has without doubt very often occasioned the death to be attributed to these, though it is certain but few horses on our commons can escape them.\n\nInfantiles have occurred of violent inflammation excited in the stomach by the bots. An example of this is related by Mr James Clark. He was once desired by a farrier in the neighbourhood who was indisposed, to visit a horse that had been a patient of his for some days, and report the situation he was in. When Mr Clark entered the stable, the servant was giving the horse a drink, which he was afterwards informed was composed of an infusion of linseed, in which was dissolved one ounce of nitre, with honey to sweeten it; and in the last hornful was poured, from a small phial, about half an ounce, or more, of spirits of hartshorn. The horse seemed very uneasy after the drink, he was soon seized with a violent trembling and shaking, a profuse sweat broke out all over his body, and run down his sides, as if water had been poured on him; at the same time his legs and ears were quite cold; he lay down seemingly in great agony; he was soon after convulsed all over, and died in about half an hour from the time the drink was swallowed. Mr Clark obtained leave to take out his stomach where he was, on condition he should sew up the skin afterwards, in order to prevent any bad smell in the stable, till he could be carried off. On inspecting the stomach, the coats of it were found greatly inflamed, and a mortification had taken place on one side, where it appeared of a darker colour, and here there was a small hole, through which a lead probe passed into the cavity of the stomach from the outside; the coats of the stomach were considerably thickened, and of a darkish red colour resembling the liver; at the same time the stomach was considerably distended and full of food: on turning it inside out, an incredible number of bots were found sticking all round the sides and lower part of it, so that it appeared entirely covered with them, sticking as closely to one another as bees in a honeycomb; and so firmly were the heads of these vermin fixed in the coats of the stomach, that endeavouring to pull some of them off when alive, they broke in two, and their heads remained sticking in the coats of the stomach.\n\nThe great irritation produced by such a number of these worms sticking in the coats of the stomach had no doubt occasioned at first an inflammation there, and from its continuance this was tending to a mortification, before the drench was given, and would have occasion-\n\nAnother species of Oeirrus, viz. the Haemorrhoidalis, also produces eggs, which when received into the stomach of the horse become bots. This insect has been termed haemorrhoidalis from the appearance of the bots when coming out of the anus of the horse, when they are very like the swelling produced by the piles or hemorrhoids. It was supposed by Linnaeus and some other naturalists, that this and the last species introduced their eggs into the bowels of the horse, by entering the rectum, mire per anus intrans; but this opinion is now fully refuted.\n\nThe part chosen by this insect for this purpose, is the lips of the horse, which is very distressing to the animal from the excessive titillation it occasions; for he immediately after rubs his mouth against the ground, his fore legs, or sometimes against a tree; or if two are standing together, they often rub themselves against each other. At the sight of this fly, the horse appears much agitated, and moves his head backwards and forwards in the air, to baulk its touch, and prevent its darting on the lips; but the fly, watching for a favourable opportunity, continues to repeat the operation from time to time; till at length finding this mode of defense insufficient, the enraged animal endeavours to avoid it, by galloping away to a distant part of the field. If it still continues to follow and tease him, his last resource is in the water, where the Oeirrus is never observed to follow him.\n\nThe teasing of other flies will sometimes occasion a motion of the head similar to this; but it should not be mistaken for it, as it is fever in any degree so violent, as during the attack of the Oeirrus.\n\nAt other times the Oeirrus gets between the fore legs of the horse while he is grazing, and thus makes its attack on the lower lip; the titillation occasions the horse to stamp violently with his fore feet, against the ground, and often strike with his foot, as aiming a blow at the fly. They also sometimes hide themselves in the grass; and as the horse stoops to graze, they dart on the mouth, or lips, and are always observed to poise themselves a few seconds in the air, while the egg is preparing on the point of the abdomen.\n\nWhen several of these flies are confined in a close place, they have a particularly strong fetid smell; and I have observed both sheep, and horses, when teased by them, to look into the grass, and smell to it very anxiously; and if they by these means discover the fly, they immediately turn aside, and hasten to a distant part of the field.\n\nThe eggs of this species appear of a darker colour than the former, and we are unacquainted with the circumstances attending their passage to the stomach.\n\nThe larvae of the Oeirrus haemorrhoidalis, as well as the former species, appear to have been termed among the Romans, coelus, which seems to have been a general expression for any kind of soft imperfect animal, and to have been very analogous, and as extensively applied iii. p. 310, as the word grub is at present in the English language.\n\nThe presence of bots in the horse's stomach and bowels, is not always easily ascertained, as it is certain that great numbers have been found in the stomach after death, without appearing to have produced any unusual symptoms in the animal while alive. When, however, they have collected in any great numbers, or when the animal's stomach is peculiarly irritable, they are attended with the following symptoms. The horse has a dif-\nDiseases.\n\nposition to rub his tail frequently, without any apparent humour or eruption that should make it itchy; he eats heartily, and is yet always lean and out of condition. His coat is rough and flaring, such as we have described it to be in what is called a surfeit. There is also a fleshy paleness of the mouth and tongue, attended with an unwholesome cadaverous smell. The horse appears tucked up in his flanks, which often heave; he turns his head now and then, and strikes his belly with his hind feet. These latter symptoms indeed, as they only indicate griping pains, and often occur in ordinary colic, are not to be relied on, unless accompanied with the former. In cases of worms, it is said that the dung is yellowish, like melted sulphur, or is otherwise discoloured and very offensive. The surfeit mark, however, of the presence of bots is their being voided by the anus, where they are sometimes found sticking.\n\nTreatment.\n\nAs the bots are extremely tenacious of life, it is very difficult to expel them, and where they do not occasion any considerable irritation or other bad symptoms, it will be better to let them alone till they come away spontaneously. But when it is judged necessary to attempt their expulsion, this may be done by administering the sal indus, as directed in No. 60 of the receipts, and after it a strong dose of calomel and aloes.\n\nWe have said the bots are not properly worms; but there are several species of worms that are very frequent in dogs, and are now and then found in the horse. These are the lumbrici, or long round worms; the acariides, or thread worms; and the tenia, or tape-worms.\n\nThe long round worms are seldom met with in these animals; but when they occur in the horse, they produce much uneasiness, and sometimes occasion colic and inflammation of the bowels. It is very difficult to expel these worms, as the only remedies by which this could be properly attempted, such as powdered tin and strong purgatives, cannot with propriety be often given to a horse, as, from the structure of his stomach, the former might produce considerable injury, and the latter are extremely debilitating.\n\nAcariides are now and then found in the great guts of the horse, and sometimes prove troublesome, but are seldom or never dangerous. They are best removed by clysters of lime-water, followed by purgative clysters.\n\nThe tape-worm is seldom found but in dogs, where they are sometimes the cause of fatal diseases, especially to puppies. The symptoms of worms in dogs are, an itchiness of the nose and at the anus, both of which they are perpetually rubbing against every thing; swelling and hardness of the belly, lameness, running at the eyes and nose, and frequent purging of a slimy or stringy matter. There is also a peculiar staring appearance of the hair, which points the wrong way.\n\nMr Blaine says that the bowels of dogs are so irritable, that they will seldom bear strong physic, and that he knows of nothing that will certainly destroy the worms in their intestines. He has tried with various success, tin, quicksilver, pewter, calomel, and saffron, with other substances, but none of them appeared sufficiently certain to demand his confidence. When the worms are early detected, he thinks that purging doses of the compound powder of scammony with calomel, prove the most efficacious means. Mr Daniel recommends aloes, hartshorn, the juice of wormwood, with some flower of bismuth, mixed together into a ball, about the size of a hazel nut, which is to be wrapped up in butter, and given three or four times a week, letting the dog fast for a few hours each time, which, he says, will destroy the worms. He also says that they may be destroyed by giving the dog as much finely powdered white glass as will lie on a sixpence, for three successive mornings, mixed up with butter; and if the worms are not voided in that time, the dose of the glass is to be increased, and it is to be repeated for three other mornings, by which time it will scarcely fail of producing the desired effect.\n\nThere is a sort of concretion often met with in the stomachs of cattle, and sometimes in that of horses, which is partly composed of a chalky substance, and partly, or sometimes almost entirely, of hair evidently arising from the animal's licking off their hair and swallowing it with their saliva. The mass thus received into the stomach, being wholly indigestible, collects there, and forms these globular concretions which sometimes grow to such a size as to prove fatal.\n\nThe growth of these concretions is thought to be encouraged by the long use of hard dry food, without the animal's being allowed to feed from time to time on fresh green herbage. It is even thought that the timely use of fresh grass may prove the means of dissolving these concretions. Van Swieten, in his commentaries on Boerhaave, when speaking of chalky matters found in the liver and other organs, remarks, that sometimes there are concretions of the like sort found in this organ, but of a more friable texture, and of a whiter appearance, like gypsum or plaster of Paris. Such incrustations were often observed by Glisson in the pori biliarii, and its larger branches dispersed through the livers of oxen that had been fed in stalls with hay and straw during the winter season and without exercise. But these concretions are very friable, and they afterwards dissolve again, and pass out of the body when the cattle come to feed upon the fresh grass of the meadows; for in oxen that are slain in the spring or summer, they are very rarely to be found.\n\n\"In defective horses, (says Mr Clark) I have frequently met with chalky concretions in their livers and in the lungs, especially in those that have been fed long on dry food, and likewise round balls in their stomachs, sometimes of an oval shape. The latter seem for the most part to be composed of the dust they lick from their own bodies mixed with the hair. Whether the fresh grass dissolves them is not so certain; but that it causes these concretions to pass through the intestines, I have had a full demonstration. In May 1786, a horse that had been long fed on dry food was turned out to grass; in about eight or ten days afterwards, he was seized with violent griping pains, which lasted for about 24 hours, when he died. As the horse was very fat, the man who had the charge of him wanted to make something of his grease. In searching for it, he observed a large space of the intestines of a very black colour; and on feeling it, found something hard and weighty within them. He immediately cut it open with his knife, and took out a large oval hard ball, which measured four inches in length, and three inches and a half in breadth, and which I have now in my possession. That this concretion was originally formed in the stomach,\nDiseases of the stomach, there can be no doubt, as they frequently upon digestion have been found there, and nothing but its great bulk had hindered it from passing through the intestines.","sp":83,"ep":118},{"h":"FARWELL-CAPE","t":"the most southerly promontory of Greenland, in W.

Some divines even pretend its origin was in the earthly paradise, where our first parents were forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge. But though this seems carrying the matter too far, it is certain that the Jewish church has observed fasts ever since its first institution. Nor were the neighbouring heathens, viz. the Egyptians, Phoenicians, and Assyrians, without their fasts. The Egyptians, according to Herodotus, sacrificed a cow to Isis, after having prepared themselves by fasting and prayer; a custom which he likewise attributes to the women of Cyrene. Porphyry affirms, that the Egyptians, before their stated sacrifices, always fasted a great many days, sometimes for six weeks; and that the least behoved to be for seven days: during all which time the priests and devotees not only abstained from flesh, fish, wine, and oil; but even from bread, and some kinds of pulse. These austerities were communicated by them to the Greeks, who observed their fasts much in the same manner. The Athenians had the Eleusinian and Thesmophorian fasts, the observation of which was very rigorous, especially among the women, who spent one whole day sitting on the ground in a mournful dress, without taking any nourishment. In the island of Crete, the priests of Jupiter were obliged to abstain all their lives from fish, flesh, and baked meats. Apuleius informs us, that whoever had a mind to be initiated in the mysteries of Cybele were obliged to prepare themselves by fasting ten days; and, in short, all the pagan deities, whether male or female, required this duty of those that desired to be initiated into their mysteries, of their priests and priestesses that gave the oracles, and of those who came to consult them.\n\nAmong the heathens fasting was also practised before some of their military enterprises. Aristotle informs us, that the Lacedemonians having resolved to succour a city of the allies, ordained a fast throughout the\nthe whole extent of their dominions, without excepting even the domestic animals: and this they did for two ends: one to spare provisions in favour of the besieged; the other to draw down the blessing of heaven upon their enterprise. The inhabitants of Tarentum, when besieged by the Romans, demanded succours from their neighbours of Rhegium, who immediately commanded a fast throughout their whole territories. Their enterprise having had good success by their throwing a supply of provisions into the town, the Romans were obliged to raise the siege; and the Tarentines, in memory of this deliverance, instituted a perpetual fast.\n\nFasting has always been reckoned a particular duty among philosophers and religious people, some of whom have carried their abstinence to an incredible length. At Rome it was practised by kings and emperors themselves. Numa Pompilius, Julius Caesar, Augustus, Vespasian, and others, we are told, had their stated fast days: and Julian the Apostate was so exact in this observance as to outdo the priests themselves, and even the most rigid philosophers. The Pythagoreans kept a continual fast; but with this difference, that they believed the use of fish to be equally unlawful with that of flesh. Besides their constant temperance, they also frequently fasted rigidly for a very long time. In this respect, however, they were all outdone by their master Pythagoras, who continued his fasts for no less than 40 days together. Even Apollonius Tyaneus, one of his most famous disciples, could never come up to him in the length of his fasts, though they greatly exceeded those of the ordinary Pythagoreans. The Gymnosophists, or Brahmans of the east, are also very remarkable for their severe fastings; and the Chinese, according to Father Le Comte, have also their stated fasts, with forms of prayer for preserving them from barrenness, inundations, earthquakes, &c. The Mahometans too, who possess so large a part of Asia, are very remarkable for the strict observance of their fasts; and the exactness of their dervishes in this respect is extraordinary.\n\nFasting was often used by the heathens for superstitious purposes; sometimes to procure the interpretations of dreams; at others, to be an antidote against their pernicious consequences. A piece of superstition prevails to this day among the Jews; who, though expressly forbidden to fast on Sabbath-days, think themselves at liberty to dispense with this duty when they happen to have fruitful and unlucky dreams the night preceding, that threatened them with great misfortunes. On these occasions they observe a formal fast the whole day; and at night the patient, having invited three of his friends, addresses himself to them seven times in a very solemn manner, saying, \"May the dream I have had prove a lucky one!\" And his friends answer as many times, \"Amen, may it be lucky, and God make it so!\" After which, in order to encourage him, they conclude the ceremony with these words of Ecclesiastes, \"Go eat thy bread with joy;\" and then sit themselves down to table. They have also added several fasts not commanded in the law of Moses, particularly three, in memory of sore distresses their nation has suffered at different times. The abstinence of the ancient Jews commonly lasted 27 or 28 hours at a time; beginning before sunset, and not ending till some hours after sunset next day. On these days they were obliged to wear white robes in token of grief and repentance; to cover themselves with sackcloth, or their worst clothes; to lie on ashes; to sprinkle them on their head, &c. Some spent the whole night and day following in the temple or synagogue, in prayers and other devotions, barefooted, with a scourge in their hands, of which they sometimes made a good use in order to raise their zeal. Lastly, in order to complete their abstinence, at night they were to eat nothing but a little bread dipped in water, with some salt for seasoning; except they chose to add to their repast some bitter herbs and pulse.\n\nThe ancients, both Jews and Pagans, had also their fasts for purifying the body, particularly the priests and such as were any way employed at the altars; for when nocturnal disorders happened to these, it was unlawful for them to approach all the next day, which they were bound to employ in purifying themselves. On this account, at great festivals, where their ministry could not be dispensed with, it was usual for them, on the eve thereof, not only to fast, but also to abstain from sleep, for the greater certainty. For this purpose the high priest had under officers to wake him, if overtaken with sleep; against which other preservatives were also made use of.","sp":190,"ep":191},{"h":"FASTERMANS","t":"or FASTING-MEN, q. d. homines habentes, was used in our ancient customs for men in repute and substance; or rather for pledges, sureties, or bondsmen, who, according to the Saxon polity, were fast bound to answer for one another's peaceable behaviour.","sp":191,"ep":191},{"h":"FASTI","t":"in Roman antiquity, the calendar wherein were expressed the several days of the year, with their feasts, games, and other ceremonies.\n\nThere were two sorts of fasti, the greater and lesser: the former being distinguished by the appellation fasti magistrales, and the latter by that of fasti calendares.\n\n1. The fasti calendares, which were properly and primarily called fasti, are defined by Feftus Pompeius to be books containing a description of the whole year: i.e. ephemerides, or diaries, distinguishing the several kinds of days, fasti, profasti; fasti, nefasti, &c. The author of these was Numa, who committed the care and direction of the fasti to the pontifex maximus, whom the people used to consult on every occasion. This custom held till the year of Rome 459, when C. Flavius, secretary to the pontifices, exposed in the forum a list of all the days on which it was lawful to work; which was so acceptable to the people, that they made him curule edile.\n\nThese lesser fasti, or fasti calendares, were of two kinds, urbani and rustic.\n\nThe fasti urbani, or fasti of the city, were those which obtained or were observed in the city. Some will have them thus called, because they were exposed publicly in divers parts of the city; though by the various inscriptions or gravings thereof on antique stones, one would imagine that private persons had them likewise in their houses. Ovid undertook to illustrate these fasti urbani, and comment on them, in his Libri Fastorum.\nFas, Faflorum, whereof we have the first six books still remaining; the last six, if ever they were written, being lost.\n\nIn the fafla rusticis, or country fasti, were expressed the several days, feasts, &c., to be observed by the country people: for as these were taken up in tilling the ground, fewer feasts, sacrifices, ceremonies, and holidays, were enjoined them than the inhabitants of cities; and they had also some peculiar ones not observed at Rome. These rustic fasti contained little more than the ceremonies of the kalends, nones, and ides; the fairs, signs of the zodiac, incense and decrease of the days, the tutelary gods of each month, and certain directions for rural works to be performed each month.\n\n2. In the greater fasti, or fasti magistrates, were expressed the several feasts, with every thing relating to the gods, religion, and the magistrates; the emperors, their birth-days, offices, days consecrated to them, and feasts and ceremonies established in their honour, or for their prosperity, &c. With a number of such circumstances did flattery at length swell the fasti; when they became denominated Magni, to distinguish them from the bare calendar, or fasti kalendares.\n\nFasti was also a chronicle or register of time, where-in the several years were denoted by the respective consuls, with the principal events that happened during their consulates; these were called also fasti consulares, or consular fasti.\n\nFasti, or Dies Fasti, also denoted court days. The word fasti faflorum, is formed of the verb fari, \"to speak,\" because during those days the courts were opened, causes might be heard, and the praetor was allowed fari, to pronounce the three words, do, dico, addico: The other days wherein this was prohibited were called nefasti: thus Ovid,\n\nIlle nefastus erit, per quem tria verba silentur:\nFastus erit, per quem lege licet agi.\n\nThese dieti fasti were noted in the calendar by the letter F: but observe, that there were some days ex parte fasti, partly fasti, partly nefasti; i.e., justice might be distributed at certain times of the day, and not at others. These days were called intercali, and were marked in the calendar thus; F. P. faflor primo, where justice might be demanded during the first part of that day.\n\nFasting, the abstinence from food. See Fast.\n\nMany wonderful stories have been told of extraordinary fasting; great numbers of which undoubtedly must be false. Others, however, we have on very good authority, of which some are mentioned under the article Abstinence. Another we have in the\n\nFasting Woman. A full account of this very uncommon case is given in the Phil. Trans. Vol. LXVII. Part I. the substance of which follows: The woman, whose name was Janet McLeod, an inhabitant of the parish of Kincardine in Ross-shire, continued healthy till she was 15 years of age, when she had a pretty severe epileptic fit; after this she had an interval of health for four years, and then another epileptic fit which continued a whole day and a night. A few days afterwards she was seized with a fever, which continued with violence several weeks, and from which she did not perfectly recover for some months. At this fasting time she lost the use of her eyelids; so that she was under a necessity of keeping them open with the fingers of one hand, whenever she wanted to look about her. In other respects she continued in pretty good health; only she never had any appearance of menes, but periodically spit up blood in pretty large quantities, and at the same time it flowed from the nose. This discharge continued several years; but at last it ceased: and soon after she had a third epileptic fit, and after that a fever from which she recovered very slowly. Six weeks after the crisis, she stole out of the house unknown to her parents, who were buried in their harvest work, and bound the sheaves of a ridge before she was observed. In the evening she took to her bed, complaining much of her heart (most probably her stomach, according to the phraseology of that country) and her head. From that time she never rose for five years, but was occasionally lifted out of bed. She seldom spoke a word, and took no little food that it seemed scarce sufficient to support a sucking infant. Even this small quantity was taken by compulsion; and at last, about Whitunday 1763, she totally refused every kind of food or drink. Her jaw now became so fast locked, that it was with the greatest difficulty her father was able to open her teeth a little, in order to admit a small quantity of gruel or whey; but of this so much generally run out at the corners of her mouth, that they could not be sensible any had been swallowed. About this time they got some water from a noted medicinal spring in Brae-Mar, some of which they attempted to make her swallow, but without effect. They continued their trials, however, for three mornings; rubbing her throat with the water, which run out at the corners of her mouth. On the third morning during the operation, she cried out, \"Give me more water;\" and swallowed with ease all that remained in the bottle. She spoke no more intelligibly for a year; though she continued to mutter some words, which her parents only understood, for 14 days. She continued to reject all kinds of food and drink till June 1765. At this time her father thought, by some figs he made, that she wanted her jaws opened; and this being done, not without violence, she called intelligibly for a drink, and drank with ease about an English pint of water. Her father then asked her why she would not make some signs when she wanted a drink? to which she answered, why should she when she had no desire. It was now supposed that she had regained the faculty of speech; and her jaws were kept open for about three weeks by means of a wedge. But in four or five days she became totally silent, and the wedge was removed because it made her lips sore. She still, however, continued sensible; and when her eyelids were opened, knew everybody, as could be guessed from the signs she made.\n\nBy continuing their attempts to force open her jaws, two of the under foreteeth were driven out; and of this opening her parents endeavoured to avail themselves by putting some thin nourishing drink into her mouth; but without effect, as it always returned by the corners. Sometimes they thought of thrusting a little dough of oatmeal through this gap of the teeth, which she would retain a few seconds, and then return with something like a straining to vomit, without one particle\nFasting. ticle going down. Nor were the family sensible of anything like swallowing for four years, excepting the small draught of Brae-Mar water and the English pint of common water. For the last three years she had not any evacuation by stool or urine, except that once or twice a-week she passed a few drops of urine, about as much, to use the expression of her parents, as would wet the surface of a halfpenny. In this situation she was visited by Dr Mackenzie, who communicated the account of her case to the Royal Society. He found her not at all emaciated; her knees were bent, and the hamstring tight, so that her heels almost touched her buttocks. She slept much, and was very quiet; but when awake, kept a constant whimpering like a newborn weakly infant. She never could remain a moment on her back, but always fell to one side or another; and her chin was clasped close to her breast, nor could it by any force be moved backwards.\n\nThe doctor paid his first visit in the month of October; and five years afterwards, viz. in October 1772, was induced to pay her a second visit, by hearing that she was recovering, and had begun to eat and drink. The account given him was most extraordinary. Her parents one day returning from their country labours (having left their daughter fixed to her bed as usual), were greatly surprised to find her sitting upon her hams, on the side of the house opposite to her bed-place, spinning with her mother's distaff. All the food she took at that time was only to crumble a little oat or barley cake in the palm of her hand, as if to feed a chicken. She put little crumbs of this into the gap of her teeth; rolled them about for some time in her mouth; and then sucked out of the palm of her hand a little water, whey, or milk; and this only once or twice a-day, and even that by compulsion. She never attempted to speak; her jaws were fast locked, and her eyes shut. On opening her eyelids, the balls were found to be turned up under the edge of the os frontis; her countenance was ghastly, her complexion pale, and her whole person emaciated. She seemed feeble, and tractable in every thing except in taking food. This she did with the utmost reluctance, and even cried before she yielded. The great change of her looks Dr Mackenzie attributed to her spinning flax on the distaff, which exhausted too much of the saliva; and therefore he recommended to her parents to confine her totally to the spinning of wool. In 1775, she was visited again, and found to be greatly improved in her looks as well as strength; her food was also considerably increased in quantity; though even then she did not take more than would be sufficient to sustain an infant of two years of age.\n\nThe following remarkable instances of animals being able to live long without food, are related by Sir William Hamilton in his account of the late earthquakes in Italy (Phil. Transf. vol. lxxiii). \"At Soriano (says he), two fattened hogs that had remained buried under a heap of ruins, were taken out alive the 42d day; they were lean and weak, but soon recovered.\" Again, \"At Messina two mules belonging to the duke de Belvil remained under a heap of ruins, one of them 22 days, and the other 23 days; they would not eat for some days, but drank water plentifully, and are now recovered. There are numberless instances of dogs remaining many days in the same situation; and a hen belonging to the British vice-consul at Messina, that had been closely shut up under the ruins of his house, was taken out the 22d day, and is now recovered; it did not eat for some days, but drank freely; it was emaciated, and showed little signs of life at first. From these instances, and those related before of the hogs at Soriano, and several others of the same kind that have been related to me, but which being less remarkable I omit, one may conclude, that long fasting is always attended with great thirst and total loss of appetite.\"\n\nAn instance of a similar kind, not less remarkable than either of the two preceding, we find in the Gentleman's Magazine for January 1785, communicated by a correspondent, as follows: \"During the heavy snow which fell in the night of the 7th of January 1779, a parcel of sheep belonging to Mr John Wolley, of Matlock, in Derbyshire, which were pastured on that part of the East Moor that lies within the manor of Matlock, were covered with the drifted snow: in the course of a day or two all the sheep that were covered with the snow were found again, except two, which were consequently given up as lost; but on the 14th of February following (some time after the break of the snow in the valleys, and 38 days after the fall), as a servant was walking over a large parcel of drifted snow which remained on the declivity of a hill, a dog he had with him discovered one of the two sheep that had been lost, by winding (or scenting) it through a small aperture which the breath of the sheep had made in the snow; the servant thereupon dug away the snow, and released the captive from its prison; it immediately ran to a neighbouring spring, at which it drank for a considerable time, and afterwards rejoined its old companions as though no such accident had befallen it. On inspecting the place where it was found, it appeared to have stood between two large stones which lay parallel with each other at about two feet and a half distance, and probably were the means of protecting it from the great weight of the snow, which, in that place lay several yards thick: from the number of stones around it, it did not appear that the sheep had been able to pick up any food during its confinement. Soon afterwards its owner removed it to some low lands; but as it had nearly lost its appetite, it was fed with bread and milk for some time: in about a fortnight after its enlargement it lost its sight and wool; but in a few weeks afterwards they both returned again, and in the course of the following summer it was quite recovered. The remaining sheep was found dead about a week after the discovery of the other.\"\n\nIn the same publication is recorded the death of one Caleb Elliot, a visionary enthusiast, who meant to have fasted 40 days, and actually survived 16 without bituary food, having obstinately refused sustenance of every kind.","sp":191,"ep":193},{"h":"FASTOLF","t":"Sir John, a valiant and renowned English officer, a knight banneret and of the garter, who served in France under Henry IV.

See Anatomy Index.\n\nStrong exercise, supernatural heat, an acrimonious state of the juices, and other like causes, by which the oily parts of the blood are attenuated, resolved, or evacuated, prevent the generation of fat; labours of the mind also have this effect, as well as labour or intemperance of the body. Hence rest and plentiful food are sufficient to fatten brutes; but with men it is often otherwise. It is surprising how soon some birds grow fat; ortolans, it is said, in 24 hours, and larks still sooner.\n\nFats may be divided, from their consistence, into three kinds: (1.) The soft and thin, which grow perfectly liquid in a very small heat; (2.) The thick and consistent, which liquefy less readily; and, (3.) The hard and firm, which require a still stronger heat to melt them. The first is called Pinguedo; the second, Avengia; and the third, Adeps, as taken from the animal; and Selum, or Sevum, when freed from the skins, &c. This use of the names, however, is not constant, some employing them differently.\n\nA great number of fats have been kept in the shops, for making ointments, plasters, and other medicinal compositions; as hog's lard, the fat of the boar, the fox, the hare, dog, wild cat, Alpine moufe, beaver; that of hens, ducks, geese, storks; of the whale, pike, serpents, viper, &c. as also human fat.\u2014In regard to all these kinds of substances, however, much depends upon the manner of purifying or trying, and of keeping them.\n\nTo obtain fat pure, it must be cut into pieces, and cleaned from the interposed membranes and vessels. It must then be cleansed from its gelatinous matter by washing with water, till the water comes from it colourless and insipid; it is afterwards to be melted with a moderate heat in a proper vessel with a little water; and it is to be kept thus melted till the water be entirely evaporated, which is known by the discontinuance of the boiling, which is caused by the water only, and which lasts till not a drop of it remains; it is afterwards to be put into an earthen pot, where it fixes; then it is exceedingly white, sufficiently pure for the purposes of pharmacy or chemical examination.\n\nFat thus purified has very little taste, and a weak, but peculiar smell. For its analysis and chemical properties, see Chemistry Index.\n\nOne of the chief uses of fat probably is, to receive into its composition, to blunt and correct, a great part of the acids of the aliments, and which are more than are requisite to the composition of the nutritive juice, or which nature could not otherwise expel. This is certain, that the greater the quantity of aliments taken by healthy animals, above what is necessary for their nourishment and reproduction, the fatter they become. Hence animals which are castrated, which are not much exercised, or which are come to an age when the loss and production of the seminal fluid is less, and which at the same time consume much succulent aliment, generally become fatter, and sometimes exceedingly so.\n\nAlthough fat be very different from truly animalized substances, and appears not easily convertible into nutritive juices, it being generally difficult of digestion, and apt to become rancid, as butter does in the stomachs of many persons; yet in certain cases it serves to the nourishment and reparation of the body. Animals certainly become lean, and live upon their fat, when they have too little food, and when they have diseases which prevent digestion and the production of the nutritive juice; and in these cases the fatter animals hold out longer than the leaner. The fat appears to be then absorbed by the vessels designed for this use, and to be transformed into nutritive juice.\n\nFat, in the sea language, signifies the same with broad. Thus a ship is said to have a fat quarter, if the trussing in or tuck of her quarter be deep.","sp":194,"ep":194},{"h":"FAT LIKEWISE","t":"t likewise denotes an uncertain measure of capacity. Thus a fat of inglands contains from 3\u00bd hundred weight to 4 hundred weight; a fat of unbound books, half a maund or four bales; of wire, from 20 to 25 hundred weight; and of yarn, from 220 to 221 bundles.\n\nFat, or VAT, is used also for several utensils: as, 1. A great wooden vessel, employed for measuring of malt, and containing a quarter or eight bushels. 2. A large brewing vessel, used by brewers to run their wort in. 3. A leaden pan or vessel for the making of salt at Droitwich.\n\nFATA MORGANA; a very singular phenomenon, mentioned by different philosophical writers and travellers, particularly by Brydone and Swinburne. They inform us that it is seen in the straits of Messina, and sometimes denominated the castles of the Fairy Morgana. The accounts of this phenomenon differ considerably from each other, and travellers are not unanimous as to the causes which are necessary for its production. It would perhaps be difficult to determine how far the imagination of those who have spoken of it may be considered capable of producing astonishment, yet the actual existence of such a phenomenon admits of no dispute.\n\nThe first chapter of Minasi, in his Dissertation on the Fata Morgana, speaks of this phenomenon in the following manner. When the rising sun thins from that point whence its incident ray forms an angle of 45\u00b0 on the sea of Reggio, and the bright surface of the water in the bay is not disturbed either by the wind or the current, the spectator being placed on an eminence of the city, with his back to the sun and his face to the sea; on a sudden there appear in the water, as in a catoptric theatre, various multiplied objects, that is to say, numberless series of pilasters, arches, castles well delineated, regular columns, lofty towers, superb palaces, with balconies and windows, extended alleys of trees, delightful plains with herbs and flocks, armies of men on foot and horseback, and many other strange images, in their natural colours and proper actions, passing rapidly in succession along the surface of the sea during the whole of the short period of time while the above-mentioned causes remain.\n\n\"But if, in addition to the circumstances before described, the atmosphere be highly impregnated with vapour and dense exhalations, not previously dispersed by the action of the wind or waves, or rarefied by the sun, it...\"\nit then happens that in this vapour, as in a curtain extended along the channel to the height of about 30 palms, and nearly down to the sea, the observer will behold the scene of the same objects not only reflected from the surface of the sea, but likewise in the air, though not so distinct or well defined as the former objects from the sea.\n\n\"If the air be slightly hazy and opake, and at the same time dewy and adapted to form the iris, then the above-mentioned objects will appear only at the surface of the sea, as in the first case, but all vividly coloured, or fringed with red, green, blue, and other prismatic colours.\"\n\nFrom this account of Minasi it appears, that there are three different species of Fata Morgana; the first appearing at the surface of the sea, denominated the Marine Morgana; the second in the air, called the Aerial Morgana, and the third only at the surface of the sea, or Morgana fringed with prismatic colours. The same ingenious author attempted to trace the etymology of the word Morgana, which he thinks is derived from \u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c2, \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b3\u03cd\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2, and \u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c3, \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c6\u03af\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2. This splendid sight affects all descriptions of men with such joy, that they run towards the sea, exclaiming Morgana, Morgana! This etymology of Minasi may seem at first view to be a contradiction in terms; but it will appear most natural, when we consider the joy which the Morgana inspires, and the corresponding sorrow or dejection which must be felt when it vanishes away. Our author informs us, that he beheld this magnificent appearance three times, and would rather behold it again than the \"most superb theatrical exhibition in the world.\"\n\nIn his physical and astronomical remarks on this phenomenon, he observes that the sea in the straits of Messina exhibits the appearance of a large inclined speculum; that, in the alternate current or tide which flows and returns in the straits for six hours each way, and is constantly attended by an opposite current along shore to the medium distance of about half a league, there are many eddies and irregularities at the time of the change of its direction; and that the Morgana usually appears at this period. He describes the effects produced by it to the supposed inclination of the surface of the sea, and its subdivision into different planes by the contrary eddies. The effects produced in the air he considers as the result of saline and other effluvia suspended in the air. These appearances are produced by a calm sea, and one or more strata of superincumbent air differing in refractive, and consequently in reflective power, rather than from any considerable change in the surface of the water, with the laws of which we are much better acquainted than with those of the atmosphere.\n\nTo the above account we shall add the following, given by M. Houel, whose judgment and veracity render his authority highly respectable. \"In fine summer days, when the weather is calm, there rises above the great current a vapour, which acquires a certain density, so as to form in the atmosphere horizontal prisms, whose sides are disposed in such a manner, that when they come to their proper degree of perfection, they reflect and represent successively, for some time (like a moveable mirror), the objects on the coast or in the adjacent country. They exhibit by turns the city and suburbs of Messina, trees, animals, men, and mountains. They are certainly beautiful aerial moving pictures. There are sometimes two or three prisms, equally perfect; and they continue in this state eight or ten minutes. After this, some shining inequalities are observed upon the surface of the prism, which render confused to the eye the objects which had been before so accurately delineated, and the picture vanishes. The vapour forms other combinations, and is dispersed in air. Different accounts have been given of this singular appearance; which for my part I attribute to a bitumen that issues from certain rocks at the bottom of the sea, and which is often seen to cover a part of its surface in the strait of Messina. The subtile parts of the bitumen being attenuated, combined, and exhaled with the aqueous globules that are raised by the air, and formed into bodies of vapour, give to this condensed vapour more consistence; and contribute, by their smooth and polished particles, to the formation of a kind of aerial crystal, which receives the light, reflects it to the eye, and transmits to it all the luminous points which colour the objects exhibited in this phenomenon, and render them visible.\"\n\nFATE (fatum), denotes an inevitable necessity depending upon a superior cause. The word is formed \u00e0 fando, \"from speaking,\" and primarily implies the same with effatum, viz. a word or decree pronounced by God; or a fixed sentence whereby the Deity has prescribed the order of things, and allotted to every person what shall befall him.\n\nThe Greeks called it \u03bd\u03b1\u03c5\u03c0\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1, as it were a chain or necessary series of things indissolubly linked together. It is also used to express a certain unavoidable designation of things, by which all agents, both necessary and voluntary, are swayed and directed to their ends. See NECESSITY.\n\nIn this last sense, fate is distinguished into, 1. Astrological fate, arising from the influence and position of the heavenly bodies; which (it was supposed) gave laws both to the elements and mixed bodies, and to the wills of men. 2. Stoical fate, defined by Cicero an order or series of causes, wherein, cause being linked to cause, each produces another, and thus all things flow from one prime cause. To this fate the Stoics subject even the gods.\n\nFate is divided by later authors into physical and divine. Physical fate is an order and series of natural causes appropriated to their effects. By this fate it is that fire warms, bodies communicate motion to each other, &c. and the effects of it are all the events and phenomena of nature. 2. Divine fate is what is more usually called PROVIDENCE.

The principal sacrifice was a roe-buck; or rather, according to Horace, a kid, attended with libations of wine and burning of incense. It was properly a country festival, being performed in the fields and villages with peculiar joy and devotion.

Entering early into holy orders,\nhe settled first at Bramham in Yorkshire, near the elegant seat of that name (Mr Lane's), which he celebrated in verse in 1745, in a 4to pamphlet anonymous. His first poetical publications were, Gawen Douglas's Description of May and Winter modernized. Removing afterwards to the curacy of Croydon in Surrey, he recommended himself to the notice of Archbishop Herring, then resident there on account of his health, to whom, besides other pieces, he addressed an ode on his recovery in 1754, printed in Mr Dudley's collection. In consequence, his grace collated him in 1755 to the vicarage of Orpington with St Mary Gray in Kent; and Mr Fawkes lamented his patron's death in 1757 in a pathetic elegy styled Aurelius, first printed with his grace's seven sermons, in 1763. He married about the same time Miss Purrier of Leeds. In April 1774, by the late Dr Plumptree's favour, he exchanged his vicarage for the rectory of Hayes. He was also one of the chaplains to the princess dowager of Wales. He published a volume of poems by subscription in 8vo, 1761; the Poetical Kalendar 1762; and Poetical Magazine 1764, in conjunction with Mr Woty; Partridge Shooting, an eclogue, to the honourable Cha. Yorke, 1767, 4to; and a Family Bible, with notes, in 4to, a compilation. But his great strength lay in translation, in which, since Pope, few have equalled him. Witness his fragments of Menander (in his Poems); his works of Anacreon, Sappho, Bion, Moschus, and Musaeus, 12mo, 1765; his Idylls of Theocritus, by subscription, 8vo, 1767; and his Argonautics of Apollonius Rhodius, by subscription also (a posthumous publication, completed by the Reverend Mr Meen of Emanuel College, Cambridge), 8vo, 1792. He died August 26, 1777.","sp":196,"ep":197},{"h":"FE","t":"Fo, or Fohi, the name of the chief god of the Chinese, whom they adore as the sovereign of heaven.

It has been divided into general and special: general, that which is to be performed by every subject to his prince; and special, required only of such as, in respect of their fee, are tied by oath to their lords. To all manner of tenures, except tenancy at will, and frank-almoign, fealty is incident, though it chiefly belongs to copyhold estates held in fee and for life. The form of this oath, by stat. 17 Edw. II. is to run as follows: \"I A.

So help me God.\"","sp":197,"ep":197},{"h":"FEAR","t":"one of the passions of the human mind; (see PASSION). It is defined, an apprehension of impending evil, attended with a desire of avoiding it.\n\nFear in the extreme is called fright or terror. See FRIGHT.\n\nFear, in Scripture, is used in various senses.\n\nThe fear of God is either filial or servile. The filial fear is a holy affection or gracious habit in the soul, whereby it is inclined to obey all God's commandments, and to hate and avoid evil. Servile or servile fear is the consequence of guilt; it is a judicial impression from the sad thoughts of the provoked majesty of heaven; it is an alarm within that disturbs the rest of a sinner. Though this fear be in wicked men, yet it often proves preparative to faith and repentance.\n\nFear is likewise used for the object of fear. Thus it is said, \"the fear of Isaac,\" to describe the God whom Isaac feared; (Gen. xxxi. 24.), and in Prov. i. 26. \"I will mock when your fear cometh;\" that is, the calamity you feared. God says, that he will send his fear before his people; that is, a dread wrought by him, in order to terrify and destroy the inhabitants of Canaan.\n\nFear (Metus, Pavor, or Timor), was deified by the Pagans. Tullus Hostilius brought the worship of this deity to Rome. The Ephori of Sparta erected a temple to Fear, near their tribunal, to strike an awe into those who approached it. Fear was likewise worshipped at Corinth. The poets did not forget this imaginary deity. Virgil places her in the entrance of hell, in company with disfates, old age, &c. \u00c6n. vi. 273. Ovid places her in the retinue of Tiphthophne one of the furies, Met. iv. 483.","sp":197,"ep":197},{"h":"FEAST","t":"or Festival, in a religious sense, is a ceremony of feasting and thanksgiving. The word is formed of the Latin festum, which some derive a ferari: \"to keep holiday;\" others from the Greek \u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1, \"I feast or entertain;\" of \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03b1, \"hearth, fire.\"\n\nFeasts, and the ceremonies thereof, have made great part of the religion of almost all nations and sects; witness those of the Greeks, Romans, Hebrews, Christians, and Mahometans.\n\nThe first feasts among the Greeks were celebrated in solemn assemblies of the whole nation, on occasion of their games, as the Olympic, the Pythian, the Isthmian, and Nemean: in process of time they had many others, the principal of which are enumerated in the course of this work.\n\nThe Romans also had abundance of stated feasts in honour of their deities and heroes; such were the Saturnalia, Cerealia, Lupercalia, Liberalia, Neptunalia, Consualia, Portunalia, Vulcanalia, Palilia, Divalia, &c. See SATURNALIA, &c.\n\nThey had also feasts instituted occasionally; as Carmentalia,\nFeast mentalia, Quirinalia, Terminalia, Floralia, Compitalia, Lemuria, Vernalia, beside other moveable and occasional ones: as to give thanks to the gods for benefits received; to implore their affluence, or to appease their wrath, &c. as the Paganalia, Ferialia, Bacchanalia, Ambarvalia, Amburbalia, Suovetaurilia, and divers others, particularly denominated feriae; as Sementinae, Latine, &c. See each of these feasts, and feriae in its proper place. The feasts were divided into days of sacrifice, and days of banqueting and feasting; days of games, and days of rest or feriae.\n\nThere being but little history written, or at least published in those days, one end of feasts was to keep up the remembrance of past occurrences.\n\nThe principal feasts of the Jews were the feast of trumpets, that of the expiation, of tabernacles, of the dedication, of the pasover, of pentecost, and that of purification. See Expiation, &c.\n\nThe modern Jews have other feasts marked in their calendar, of modern institution. The Mahometans, besides their weekly feast or Sabbath, which is kept on Friday, have two solemn feasts, the first of which is called the Feast of Victims, and celebrated on the tenth day of the last month of their year; and the second called Bairam. The Chinese have two solemn feasts in the year, in the memory of Confucius, besides others of less note on the other days of the year.\n\nFeasts among us are either immovable or moveable.\n\nImmovable Feasts are those constantly celebrated on the same day of the year; the principal of these are Christmas day or the Nativity, the Circumcision, Epiphany, Candlemas or the Purification, Lady Day or the Annunciation, called also the Incarnation and Conception, All Saints and All Souls; besides the days of the several Apostles, St Thomas, St Paul, &c. which with us are feasts, though not feriae. See each feast under its proper article.\n\nMoveable Feasts are those which are not confined to the same day of the year. Of these the principal is Easter, which gives law to all the rest, all of them following, and keeping their proper distances from it; such are Palm-Sunday, Good-Friday, Ash-Wednesday, Sexagesima, Ascension Day, Pentecost, and Trinity-Sunday. See Easter, Sexagesima, Pentecost, Trinity, &c.\n\nThe four feasts which the English laws take special notice of are, the Annunciation of the blessed Virgin Mary or Lady Day, the 25th of March; the nativity of St John the Baptist, held on the 24th of June; the Feast of St Michael the Archangel, on the 29th of September; and that of St Thomas the Apostle, on the 21st of December: on which quarterly days rent on leases is usually referred to be paid (5 and 6 Edw. VI. cap. 3. 3 Jac. I. cap. 1. 12 Car. II. cap. 30.)\n\nBesides these feasts which are general, and enjoined by the church, there are others local and occasional, enjoined by the magistrate, or voluntarily set on foot by the people; such are the days of thanksgiving for deliverance from wars, plagues, &c. Such also are the vigils or wakes in commemoration of the dedications of particular churches. See Vigil, &c.\n\nThe prodigious increase of feast days in the Christian church commenced towards the close of the fourth century, and was occasioned by the discovery that was then made of the remains of martyrs and other holy men, for the commemoration of whom they were established. These, instead of being let apart for pious exercises, were abused in indolence, voluptuousness, and criminal practices. Many of them were instituted on a pagan model, and perverted to similar purposes.\n\nFeast of Death, or Feast of Souls, a solemn religious ceremony in use among the savages of America; some of whom thus testify their respect for the deceased every eight years; and others, as the Hurons and Iroquois, every ten years.\n\nThe day of this ceremony is appointed by public order; and nothing is omitted, that it may be celebrated with the utmost pomp and magnificence. The neighbouring tribes are invited to be present, and to join in the solemnity. At this time all who have died since the last solemn occasion are taken out of their graves; those who have been interred at the greatest distance from the villages are diligently sought for, and brought to this great rendezvous of carcases.\n\nIt is not difficult to conceive the horror of this general disinterment; but it cannot be described in a more lively manner than it is done by Lafitau, to whom we are indebted for the most authentic account of those nations.\n\n\"Without question (says he), the opening of these tombs displays one of the most striking scenes that can be conceived; this humbling portrait of human misery, in so many images of death, wherein the seems to take a pleasure to paint herself in a thousand various shapes of horror, in the several carcases, according to the degree in which corruption has prevailed over them, or the manner in which it has attacked them. Some appear dry and withered; others have a fort of parchment upon their bones; some look as if they were baked and smoked, without any appearance of rottenness; some are just turning towards the point of putrefaction; whilst others are all swarming with worms, and drowned in corruption. I know not which ought to strike us most, the horror of so shocking a sight, or the tender piety and affection of these poor people toward their departed friends: for nothing deserves our admiration more than that eager diligence and attention with which they discharge this melancholy duty of their tenderness; gathering up carefully even the smallest bones, handling the carcases, distrustful as they are, with everything loathsome, cleansing them from the worms, and carrying them upon their shoulders through tireless journeys of several days, without being discouraged from the offensiveness of the smell, and without suffering any other emotions to arise than those of regret, for having lost persons who were so dear to them in their lives, and so lamented in their death.\n\n\"They bring them into their cottages, where they prepare a feast in honour of the dead; during which their great actions are celebrated, and all the tender intercourses which took place between them and their friends are piously called to mind. The strangers, who have come sometimes many hundred miles to be present on the occasion, join in the tender condolence; and the women, by frightful shrieks, demonstrate that they are pierced with the sharpest sorrow. Then the dead bodies are carried from the cabins for the general re-interment. A great pit is dug in the ground, and thither,\nthither, at a certain time, each person attended by his family and friends, marches in solemn silence, bearing the dead body of a son, a father, or a brother. When they are all convened, the dead bodies, or the dust of those which were quite corrupted, are deposited in the pit: then the torrent of grief breaks out anew. Whatever they possess most valuable is interred with the dead. The strangers are not wanting in their generosity, and confer these presents which they have brought along with them for the purpose. Then all present go down into the pit, and every one takes a little of the earth, which they afterwards preserve with the most religious care. The bodies, ranged in order, are covered with entire new furs, and over these with bark, on which they throw flones, wood, and earth. Then taking their last farewell, they return each to his own cabin.\n\n\"We have mentioned, that in this ceremony the savages offer, as presents to the dead, whatever they value most highly. This custom, which is universal among them, arises from a rude notion of the immortality of the soul. They believe this doctrine most firmly, and it is the principal tenet of their religion. When the soul is separated from the body of their friends, they conceive that it still continues to hover around it, and require and take delight in the same things with which it formerly was pleased. After a certain time, however, it forsakes this dreary mansion, and departs far westward into the land of spirits. They have even gone so far as to make a distinction between the inhabitants of the other world; some, they imagine, particularly those who in their lifetime have been fortunate in war, possess a high degree of happiness, have a place for hunting and fishing, which never fails, and enjoy all sensual delights, without labouring hard, in order to procure them. The souls of those, on the contrary, who happen to be conquered or slain in war, are extremely miserable after death.\"\n\nFeast is also used for a banquet, or a sumptuous meal, without any immediate view to religion.\n\nThe use of the word, in this sense, arises hence; that a part of the ceremony of many of the ancient festivals, both of the heathens and agape of the Christians, was good eating; though Mr Huet chooses to derive the word from festinare, which, in an ancient Latin version of Origen's Comment on Matthew, signifies \"to feast.\" Ut veniens illuc Jesus festinat cum discipulis suis.\n\nSocial or civil feasts were also expressed by the words convivium and compositio or concenatio. Cicero says, that in the Roman tongue, the word convivium, which means \"people assembled at table,\" is more significant than the Greek word compotatio or concenatio: the Roman, says he, expresses the conjunction of body and mind which ought to take place at an entertainment; the Greek denotes what relates to the body alone.\n\nAs food is necessary to our existence, it makes a bond of association among mankind. People at a feast, says one of the ancients, seem to form but one body, one soul. All nations, whether savage or civilized, have regarded the pleasure of the table as the occasion of the most agreeable society. This species of enjoyment (abstracting from its susceptibility of abuse) makes but one family of all that it brings together. It levels the distinctions introduced by policy or prejudice, and disposes men to regard one another as brethren. It is here that people feel the equality established by nature; here they forget the evils of life; they extinguish their hatred, and make their enmities cease. For this reason Aristotle considers as a breach of the social principle that custom of the Egyptians of eating apart, and praises the convivial repasts established by Minos and Lycurgus.\n\nThe Persians generally deliberated on business at table, but never determined or put their determinations in execution except in the morning before having eaten.\n\nWhen the Germans, says Tacitus, wanted to reconcile enemies, to make alliances, to name chiefs, or to treat of war and peace, it was during the repast that they took counsel; a time in which the mind is most open to the impressions of simple truths, or most easily animated to great attempts. These artful people during the conviviality of the feast spoke without disguise. Next day they weighed the counsels of the former evening; they deliberated at a time when they were not disposed to feign, and took their resolution when they were least liable to be deceived.\n\nPeople of rank among the Rhodians, by a fundamental law of the state, were obliged to dine daily with those who had the management of affairs, in order to deliberate with them concerning such things as were necessary or useful for the country; and on this account the principal ministers of the kingdom were obliged to keep open table for all who could be of use to the state.\n\nAmong the Romans, the place where they supped was generally the vestibule, that a more retired part of the house might not encourage licentiousness and disorder. There were several laws that restricted their meals to those vestibules.\n\nWhen luxury reigned in Rome, they had superb halls for their entertainments. Lucullus had many, each of which bore the name of some deity; and this name was a mark which indicated to the servants the expense of the entertainment. The expense of a supper in Lucullus's hall of Apollo amounted to 50,000 drachmas.\n\nThe hall in which Nero feasted, by the circular motion of its walls and ceiling, imitated the revolutions of the heavens, and represented the different seasons of the year, changing at every course, and showering down flowers and perfumes on the guests.\n\nThe Romans did not, as we do, use but one table at their feasts; they had generally two; the first was for the services of animal food, which was afterwards removed, and another introduced with fruits; at this last they sung and poured out their libations. The Greeks and eastern nations had the same custom, and even the Jews in their solemn feasts and at sacrifices.\n\nThe Romans, in the time of Nero, had tables made of citron wood brought from Mauritania; they were varnished with purple and gold, and were raised on feet of carved ivory. It is said that they were more precious than gold. Dion Cassius affirms, that Seneca had 500 of these, which he made use of one after another; and Tertullian tells us that Cicero had but one. The Romans chose the king of the feast by a throw of the dice.\nWe learn from Herodotus, that the ancients had neither cups nor bowls, but that they drank out of little horns-tipt with silver or gold.\n\nUnder the reign of Charles V. of France, the custom of placing the lights upon the table was not yet introduced. A number of domestics held the candles in their hands during the whole time of the repast.\n\nThe Greeks and Romans kept a domestic for the purpose of reading during their meals and feasts. Sometimes the chief of the family himself performed the office of reader; and history informs us, that the emperor Severus often read while his family ate. The time of reading was generally at supper; and guests were invited to a reading as they are now a-days to play cards.\n\nThe Greeks, in their flourishing times, did not profane, according to their own expression, the holiness of the table; but rather adorned it with ingenious and elegant conversation; they proposed moral topics, of which Plutarch has preserved a collection.\n\nAncient philosophers remark, that heroes rarely assembled convivially without bringing affairs of consequence into discourse, or deliberating upon those that regarded either present events or future contingencies.\n\nThe Scythians, while at meat, used to make the strings of their bows resound, lest their warlike virtues might be enfeebled or lost in this season of pleasure.\n\nWhen Rome was corrupted with luxury, fingers, dancers, musicians, stage-players, and people that told pleasant tales, were brought into the hall to amuse the guests.\n\nPlutarch informs us, that Caesar, after his triumphs, treated the Roman people at 22,000 tables: and by calculation it would seem that there were at these tables upwards of 200,000 persons.\n\nAt the end of the feast the Romans drank out of a large cup as often as there were letters in the name of their mistress.\n\nFeasting seems to have been the chief delight of the Germans, Gauls, Britons, and all the other Celtic nations; in which they indulged themselves to the utmost, as often as they had an opportunity. \"Among these nations (says an author who had carefully studied their manners) there is no public assembly, either for civil or religious purposes, duly held; no birthday, marriage, or funeral, properly celebrated; no treaty of peace or alliance rightly cemented, without a great feast.\" It was by frequent entertainments of this kind that the great men or chieftains gained the affections and rewarded the services of their followers; and those who made the greatest feasts were sure to be most popular, and to have the greatest retinue. These feasts (in which plenty was more regarded than elegance) lasted commonly several days, and the guests seldom retired until they had consumed all the provisions and exhausted all the liquors. Athenaeus describes an entertainment that was given by Arcamnes, a very wealthy prince in Gaul, which continued a whole year without interruption, and at which all the people of Gaul, and even all strangers who passed through that country, were made welcome. At these feasts they sometimes consulted about the most important affairs of state, and formed resolutions relating to peace and war; imagining that men spoke their real sentiments with the greatest freedom, and were apt to form the boldest designs, when their spirits were exhilarated with the pleasures of the table. The conversation at these entertainments very frequently turned on the great exploits which the guests themselves or their ancestors had performed in war; which sometimes occasioned quarrels and even bloodshed. It was at a feast that the two illustrious British princes, Carbar and Olcar, quarrelled about their own bravery and that of their ancestors, and fell by mutual wounds. (Ossian, vol. ii. p. 8, &c.)\n\nAs to the drink used at these feasts, particularly in Britain, it seems probable, that before the introduction of agriculture into this island, mead, or honey diluted with water, was the only strong liquor known to its inhabitants, as it was to many other ancient nations in the same circumstances. This continued to be a favourite beverage among the ancient Britons, and their posterity long after they had become acquainted with other liquors. The mead-maker was the eleventh person in dignity in the courts of the ancient princes of Wales, and took place of the physician. The following ancient law of that principality shows how much this liquor was esteemed by the British princes\u2014\n\n\"There are three things in the court which must be communicated to the king before they are made known to any other person: 1. Every sentence of the judge; 2. Every new song; and, 3. Every cask of mead.\"\n\nThis was perhaps the liquor which is called by Ossian the joy and strength of shells, with which his heroes were so much delighted. After the introduction of agriculture, ale or beer became the most general drink of all the British nations who practised that art, as it had long been of all the Celtic people on the continent. (See Ale.) If the Phoenicians or Greeks imported any wine into Britain, it was only in very small quantities; that most generous liquor being very little known in this island before it was conquered by the Romans. The drinking vessels of the Gauls, Britons, and other Celtic nations, were, for the most part, made of the horns of oxen and other animals; but those of the Caledonians consisted of large shells, which are still used by some of their posterity in the Highlands of Scotland.\n\nThe dishes in which the meat was served up were either of wood or earthen ware, or a kind of baskets made of oifers. These last were most used by the Britons, as they very much excelled in the art of making them both for their own use and for exportation. The guests sat in a circle upon the ground, with a little hay, grass, or the skin of some animal under them. A low table or stool was set before each person, with the portion of meat allotted to him upon it. In this distribution, they never neglected to set the largest and best pieces before those who were most distinguished for their rank, their exploits, or their riches. Every guest took the meat set before him in his hands, and tearing it with his teeth, fed upon it in the best manner he could. If any one found difficulty in separating any part of his meat with his hands and teeth, he made use of a large knife, that lay in a particular place for the benefit of the whole company. Servants, or young boys and girls, the children of the family, stood behind the guests, ready to help them to drink or anything they wanted.\nAs the ancient Britons greatly excelled and very much delighted in music, all their feasts were accompanied with the joys of song, and the music of harps. In the words of Oflan, \"whenever the feast of shells is prepared, the songs of bards arise. The voice of sprightly mirth is heard. The trembling harps of joy are strung. They sing the battles of heroes, or the heaving breasts of love.\" Some of the poems of that illustrious British bard appear to have been composed in order to be sung by the hundred bards of Fingal at the feast of Selma. Many of the songs of the bards which were sung and played at the feasts of the ancient Britons, were of a grave and solemn strain, celebrating the brave actions of the guests, or of the heroes of other times; but there were sometimes intermixed with more sprightly and cheerful airs, to which the youth of both sexes danced, for the entertainment of the company.\n\nIt has been often observed by authors, that there is no nation in the world comes near the English in the magnificence of their feasts. Those made at our coronations, installments, consecrations, &c., transcend the belief of all foreigners; and yet it is doubted whether those now in use are comparable to those of our forefathers.\n\nWilliam the Conqueror, after he was peaceably settled on the throne of England, sent agents into different countries, to collect the most admired and rare dishes for his table; by which means, says John of Salisbury, this island, which is naturally productive of plenty and variety of provisions, was overflowed with everything that could inflame a luxurious appetite. The same writer tells us, that he was present at an entertainment which lasted from three o'clock in the afternoon to midnight; at which delicacies were served up, which had been brought from Constantinople, Babylon, Alexandria, Palestine, Tripoli, Syria, and Phoenicia. These delicacies, we may presume, were very expensive. Thomas Becket, if we may believe his historian Fitz-Stephen, gave \u00a31, equivalent to \u00a375, at present, for one dish of eels. The sumptuous entertainments which the kings of England, and of other countries, gave to their nobles and prelates, at the festivals of Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide, in which they spent a great part of their revenues, contributed very much to diffuse a taste for profuse and expensive banqueting. It was natural for a proud and wealthy baron to imitate in his own castle the entertainments he had seen in the palace of his prince. Many of the clergy too, both seculars and regulars, being very rich, kept excellent tables. The monks of St Swithins, at Winchester, made a formal complaint to Henry II. against their abbot, for taking away three of the 13 dishes they used to have every day at dinner. The monks of Canterbury were still more luxurious: for they had at least 17 dishes every day, besides a dessert; and these dishes were dished with spices and sauces, which excited the appetite as well as pleased the taste.\n\nGreat men had some kinds of provisions at their tables that are not now to be found in Britain. When Henry II. entertained his own court, the great officers of his army, with all the kings and great men of Ireland, in Dublin, at the feast of Christmas, A.D. 1171, the Irish princes and chieftains were quite astonished at the profusion and variety of provisions which they beheld, and were with difficulty prevailed upon by Henry to eat the flesh of cranes, a kind of food to which they had not been accustomed. In the remaining monuments of this period, we meet with the names of several dishes, as deligrout, maupigymun, karumpie, &c., the composition of which is now unknown.\n\nThe coronation feast of Edward III. cost \u00a32835l. 18s. 2d., equivalent to about \u00a343,000 of our money. At the installation of Ralph abbot of St Augustine, Canterbury, A.D. 1309, 6000 guests were entertained with a dinner, consisting of 3000 dishes, which cost \u00a3287l. 5s. equal in efficacy to \u00a34300l. in our times. \"It would require a long treatise (says Matthew Paris) to describe the astonishing splendour, magnificence, and festivity with which the nuptials of Richard earl of Cornwall, and Cincia daughter of Reinmund earl of Provence, were celebrated at London, A.D. 1243. To give the reader some idea of it, in a few words, above 30,000 dishes were served up at the marriage dinner.\" The nuptials of Alexander III. of Scotland, and the princess Margaret of England, were solemnized at York, A.D. 1211, with still greater pomp and profusion. \"If I attempted (says the same historian) to display all the grandeur of this festivity,\u2014the numbers of the noble and illustrious guests,\u2014the richness and variety of the dresses,\u2014the sumptuousness of the feasts,\u2014the multitudes of the minstrels, mimicks, and others whose business it was to amuse and divert the company, those of my readers who were not present would imagine that I was imposing upon their credulity.\" The following particular will enable them to form a judgment of the whole. The archbishop of York made the king of England a present of 60 fat oxen, which made only one article of provision for the marriage feast, and were all consumed at that entertainment.\n\nThe marriage feast of Henry IV. and his queen Jane of Navarre, consisted of six courses; three of flesh and fowls, and three of fish. All these courses were accompanied and adorned with jousting, as they were called. These jousters were figures in pastery, of men, women, beasts, birds, &c., placed on the table, to be admired, but not touched. Each figure had a label affixed to it containing some wise or witty saying, suited to the occasion of the feast, which was the reason they were called jousters. The installation feast of George Neville, archbishop of York and chancellor of England, exceeded all others in splendour and expense, and in the number and quality of the guests. The reader may form some idea of this enormous feast from the following list of provisions prepared for it.

Cranes, heron/haws, porpoises, and seals, are seldom seen at modern entertainments.\n\nOne of the most expensive singularities attending the royal feasts in those days consisted in what they called intermeats. These were representations of battles, sieges, &c., introduced between the courses, for the amusement of the guests. The French excelled in exhibitions of this kind. At a dinner given by Charles V. of France to the emperor Charles IV. A.D. 1378, the following intermeat was exhibited: A ship with masts, sails, and rigging, was seen first: she had for colours the arms of the city of Jerusalem: Godfrey de Bouillon appeared upon deck, accompanied by several knights armed cap-a-pie; the ship advanced into the middle of the hall, without the machine which moved it being perceptible. Then the city of Jerusalem appeared, with all its towers lined with Saracens. The ship approached the city; the Christians landed, and began the assault; the besieged made a good defence: several scaling ladders were thrown down; but at length the city was taken. Intermeats at ordinary banquets consisted of certain delicate dishes introduced between the courses, and designed rather for gratifying the taste than for satisfying hunger.\n\nAt those feasts, besides the ordinary drinks, ale and cider, there were great quantities of wines of various kinds. Of these last, the following lines of a poet who wrote in the fourth century, contain an ample enumeration.\n\nYe shall have rumney and malespine,\nBoth ypoocrasle and vernage wyne;\nMountrifffe and wyne of Greke,\nBoth algrade and despice eke,\nAntioche and basfarde,\nPyment allo, and garnarde,\nWyne of Greke and Mulcadell,\nBoth clare, pyment, and Rochell.\n\nSome of these liquors, as ypoocras, pyment, and claret, were compounded of wine, honey, and spices of different kinds, and in different proportions.","sp":197,"ep":202},{"h":"FEATHER","t":"in Physiology, a general name for the covering of birds; it being common to all the animals of this class to have their whole body, or at least the greatest part of it, covered with feathers or plumage.

Others derive it from fides, which was anciently written fedus; or from fides, \"faith.\" Others from facio, feci, \"I make,\" &c. because they made war and peace. Vossius chooses to derive it from fato, of the verb fari, \"to speak;\" in which sense the feciales should be the same with oratores; which sentiment is also confirmed by the authority of Varro, who says they were called indifferently feciales and oratores.\n\nThe feciales were a sort of heralds, who, when the Romans had any dispute with their neighbours, were sent first to demand the thing pretended to be usurped, or require satisfaction for the injury alleged to be done. If an answer was not returned by them that was satisfactory to the people and the senate, they were dispatched again to declare war, and the like in treating for peace; the feciales being the only persons appointed to negotiate between the senate, &c. and the enemy.\n\nPlutarch in the life of Numa, and Halicarnassus (lib. ii.), observes, that they were first instituted by that prince. The latter adds, that they were first chosen out of the best families in Rome; that their office, which was reputed a sort of sacerdotal, or priesthood, only ended with their life; that their persons were sacred and inviolable, as those of other priests; that they were even charged to see the republic did not declare war unjustly; that they were to receive the complaints\nFecundity, and remonstrances of nations who pretended to have been any way injured by the Romans; that if those complaints were found just, they were to seize the criminals, and deliver them up to those they had offended; that they were invested with the rights and privileges of ambassadors; that they concluded treaties of peace and alliance, and took care they were executed; and, lastly, abolished them, if they were found not to be equitable. Livy, lib. i. cap. 24, affirms their institution to Ancus Martius, in the year of Rome 114.\n\nVarro affirms us, that in his time most of these functions of the feciales were set aside; though Plutarch observes, that they had still some authority in his time.\n\nThe feciales were crowned with verbena, \"vervain,\" when they went to declare war.

Hence, where the bare liferent of any feudal subject is meant to be conveyed to A, and the absolute property to B, that meaning is expressed thus; \"to A in liferent, and to B in fee.\" See LAW, No. lix. cliv.\n\nFees are commonly divided into absolute, otherwise called fees-simple; and limited, one species of which we usually call fee-tail.\n\n1. Tenant in fee-simple (or as he is frequently styled, tenant-in-fee), is he that hath lands, tenements, or hereditaments, to hold to him and his heirs for ever; generally, absolutely and simply; without mentioning what heirs, but referring that to his own pleasure, or to the disposition of the law. The true meaning of the word fee (feodum) is the same with that of feud or feodum, and in its original sense it is taken in contradiction to allodium; which latter the writers on this subject define to be every man's own land, which he possesseth merely in his own right, without owing any rent or service to any superior. This is property in its highest degree; and the owner thereof hath absolutum et directum dominium, and therefore is said to be seised thereof absolutely in dominico suo, in his own demesne.\n\nBut feodum, or fee, is that which is held of some superior, on condition of rendering him service; in which superior the ultimate property of the land resides. And therefore Sir Henry Spelman defines a feud or fee to be, The right which the vassal or tenant hath in lands to use the same and take the profits thereof to him and his heirs, rendering to the lord his due services; the mere allodial property of the soil always remaining in the lord. This allodial property no subject in Britain has; it being a received and now undeniable principle in the law, that all the lands are holden immediately or immediately of the king. The king therefore only hath absolutum et directum dominium; but all subjects' lands are in the nature of feodum or fee, whether derived to them by descent from their ancestors, or purchased for a valuable consideration; for they cannot come to any man by either of those ways, unless accompanied with those feudal clogs which were laid upon the first feudatory when it was originally granted.\n\nA subject therefore hath only the usufruct, and not the absolute property, of the soil; or, as Sir Edward Coke expresses it, he hath dominium utile, but not dominium directum. And hence it is, that, in the most solemn acts of law, we express the strongest and highest estate that any subject can have, by these words, \"he is seised thereof in his demesne, as of fee.\" It is a man's demesne, dominium, or property, since it belongs to him and his heirs for ever; yet this dominium, property, or demesne, is strictly not absolute or allodial, but qualified or feudal: it is of his demesne, as of fee; that is, it is not purely and simply his own, since it is held of a superior lord, in whom the ultimate property resides.\n\nThis is the primary sense and acceptation of the word fee. But (as Sir Martin Wright very justly observes) the doctrine, \"that all lands are holden,\" having been for so many ages a fixed and undeniable axiom, the English lawyers do very rarely (of late years especially), use the word fee in this its primary original sense, in contradistinction to allodium or absolute property, with which they have no concern; but generally use it to express the continuance or quantity of estate. A fee therefore, in general, signifies an estate of inheritance; being the highest and most extensive interest that a man can have in a feud: and when the term is used simply, without any other adjunct, or has the adjunct of simple annexed to it (as, a fee, or a fee-simple), it is used in contradistinction to a fee-conditional at the common law, or a fee-tail by the statute; importing an absolute inheritance, clear of any condition, limitation, or restrictions to particular heirs, but descendible to the heirs-general, whether male or female, lineal or collateral. And in no other estate than this is the king said to be seised in fee, he being the feudatory of no man.\n\nTaking therefore fee in this its secondary sense, as a state of inheritance, it is applicable to, and may be had in, any kind of hereditaments either corporeal or incorporeal. But there is this distinction between the two species of hereditaments; that of a corporeal inheritance a man shall be said to be seised in his demesne, as of fee; of an incorporeal one he shall only be said to be seised as of fee, and not in his demesne. For as incorporeal hereditaments are in their nature collateral to, and illie out of, lands and houses, their owner hath no property, dominium, or demesne, in the thing itself, but hath only something derived out of it; resembling the servitudes, or services, of the civil law. The dominium, or property, is frequently in one man, while the appendage or service is in another. Thus Gaius may be seised as of fee, of a way going over the land, of which Titius is seised in his demesne as of fee.\n\nThe fee-simple or inheritance of lands and tenements is generally vested and resides in some person or other; though divers inferior estates may be carved out of it. As if one grants a lease for 21 years, or for one or two lives, the fee-simple remains vested in him and his heirs; and after the determination of those years or lives, the land reverts to the grantor or his heirs, who shall hold it again in fee-simple. Yet sometimes the fee may be in abeyance, that is (as the word signifies) in expectation, remembrance, and contemplation in law; there being no person in esse, in whom it can vest and abide, though...\nthough the law considers it as always potentially existing, and ready to vest whenever a proper owner appears. Thus, in a grant to John for life, and afterwards to the heirs of Richard, the inheritance is plainly neither granted to John nor Richard, nor can it vest in the heirs of Richard till his death, nam non est heres vivens: it remains therefore in waiting, or abeyance, during the life of Richard. This is likewise always the case of a parson of a church, who hath only an estate therein for the term of his life; and the inheritance remains in abeyance. And not only the fee, but the freehold also, may be in abeyance; as, when a parson dies, the freehold of his glebe is in abeyance until a successor be named, and then it vests in the successor.\n\nThe word heirs is necessary in the grant or donation, in order to make a fee or inheritance. For if land be given to a man for ever, or to him and his assigns for ever, this vests in him but an estate for life. This very great nicety about the insertion of the word heirs in all donations and grants, in order to vest a fee, is plainly a relic of the feudal strictness by which it was required, that the form of the donation should be punctually purposed; or that, as Craig expresses it, in the words of Baldus, donationes sint stricti juris, ne quis plus donatique praefumaurum quam in donatione expresserit. And therefore, as the personal abilities of the donee were originally supposed to be the only inducements to the gift, the donee's estate in the land extended only to his own person, and subsisted no longer than his life; unless the donor, by an express provision in the grant, gave it a longer continuance, and extended it also to his heirs. But this rule is now softened by many exceptions.\n\nFor, 1. It does not tend to devolves by will; in which, as they were introduced at the time when the feudal rigour was apace wearing out, a more liberal construction is allowed: and therefore by a devise to a man for ever, or to one and his assigns for ever, or to one in fee-simple, the devisee hath an estate of inheritance; for the intention of the deviser is sufficiently plain from the words of perpetuity annexed, though he hath omitted the legal words of inheritance. But if the devise be to a man and his assigns, without annexing words of perpetuity, there the devisee shall take only an estate for life; for it does not appear that the deviser intended any more. 2. Neither does this rule extend to fines or recoveries, considered as a species of conveyance; for thereby an estate in fee passes by act and operation of law without the word heirs: as it does also, for particular reasons, by certain other methods of conveyance, which have relation to a former grant or estate, wherein the word heirs was expressed. 3. In creations of nobility by writ, the peer so created hath an inheritance in his title, without expressing the word heirs; for they are implied in the creation, unless it be otherwise specially provided: but in creations by patent, which are stricti juris, the word heirs must be inserted, otherwise there is no inheritance. 4. In grants of lands to sole corporations and their successors, the word successors supplies the place of heirs; for as heirs take from the ancestor, so doth the successor from the predecessor. Nay, in a grant to a bishop, or other sole spiritual corporation, in frankalmogin, the word frankalmogin supplies the place of successors (as the word successors supplies the place of heirs) ex vi termini; and in all these cases a fee-simple vests in such sole corporation. But, in a grant of lands to a corporation aggregate, the word successors is not necessary, though usually inserted: for, albeit such simple grant be strictly only an estate for life, yet as that corporation never dies, such estate for life is perpetual, or equivalent to a fee-simple, and therefore the law allows it to be one. Lastly, In the case of the king, a fee-simple will vest in him, without the words heirs or successors in the grant; partly from prerogative royal and partly from a reason similar to the last, because the king, in judgment of law, never dies. But the general rule is, that the word heirs is necessary to create an estate of inheritance.\n\nII. We are next to consider limited fees, or such estates of inheritance as are clogged and confined with conditions or qualifications of any sort. And these we may divide into two sorts: 1. Qualified or bate fees; and 2. Fees conditional, so called at the common law; and afterwards fees-tail, in consequence of the statute de donis.\n\n1. A base or qualified fee, is such a one as has a qualification subjoined thereto, and which must be determined whenever the qualification annexed to it is at an end. As, in the case of a grant to A and his heirs, tenants in the manor of Dale; in this instance, whenever the heirs of A cease to be tenants of that manor, the grant is entirely defeated. So, when Henry VI. granted to John Talbot, lord of the manor of Kingstone Lisle in Berks, that he and his heirs, lords of the said manor, should be peers of the realm, by the title of Barons of Lisle; here John Talbot had a base or qualified fee in that dignity; and the instant he or his heirs quitted the seigniory of this manor, the dignity was at an end. This estate is a fee, because by possibility it may endure for ever in a man and his heirs; yet as that duration depends upon the concurrence of collateral circumstances, which qualify and debaute the purity of the donation, it is therefore a qualified or base fee.\n\n2.

One thing observed by M. de Buffon, which very greatly increases the solidity and strength of timber, is, that the trees intended to be felled for service should first be stripped of their bark, and suffered to stand and die upon the spot before the cutting. The fappy part or blea of the oak becomes by this means as hard and firm as the heart; and the real strength and density of the wood has been proved, by many experiments, to be greatly increased by it: nor is this a practice of any detriment to the proprietor, since the remaining stumps of these trees send up their young shoots as vigorously as if they had been cut down in their natural condition.\n\nWhen any tree is to be cut down for timber, the first thing to be taken care of is a skilful disbranching of such limbs as may endanger it in its fall: many trees are utterly spoiled for want of a previous care of this kind. In arms of timber that are very great, it is always necessary to chop or sink in them close to the bole, and then meeting it with downright strokes, it will be severed from the tree without splitting. In felling the tree, take care always to cut it as close to the ground as possible, unless it is intended to be grubbed up: and the doing that is of advantage both to the timber and to the wood; for timber is never so much valued, if it be known to grow out of old stocks.","sp":205,"ep":205},{"h":"FELO DE SE","t":"in Law, a person that lays deliberately violent hands on himself, and is the occasion of his untimely death, whether by hanging, drowning, stabbing, shooting, or any other way.","sp":205,"ep":205},{"h":"FELONY","t":"in the general acceptation of the law, comprises every species of crime, which occasions at common law the forfeiture of lands or goods. This most frequently happens in those crimes for which a capital punishment either is or was to be inflicted: for those felonies that are called clergyable, or to which the benefit of clergy extends, were anciently punished with death in all lay or unlearned offenders; though now, by the statute law, that punishment is for the first offence universally remitted. Treason itself, says Sir Edward Coke, was anciently comprised under the name of felony; and in confirmation of this we may observe, that the statute of treasons, 25 Edw. III. c. 2. speaking of some dubious crimes, directs a reference to parliament; that it may be there adjudged, \"whether they be treason or other felony.\" All treasons, therefore, strictly speaking, are felonies; though all felonies are not treason. And to this also we may add, that all offences, now capital, are in some degree or other felony; but this is likewise the case with some other offences, which are not punished with death; as suicide, where the party is already dead; homicide by chance-medley, or in self-defence; and petit-larceny, or pilfering; all which are (strictly speaking) felonies, as they subject the committers of them to forfeitures. So that, upon the whole, the only adequate definition of felony seems to be that which is before laid down; viz. an offence which occasions a total forfeiture of either lands or goods, or both, at the common law; and to which capital or other punishment may be superadded, according to the degree of guilt.\n\nTo explain this matter a little farther: The word felony, or felonia, is of undoubted feudal original, being frequently to be met with in the books of feuds, &c.; but the derivation of it has much puzzled the juridical lexicographers, Prateus, Calvinus, and the rest: some deriving it from the Greek, \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, \"an impostor or deceiver;\" others from the Latin, fallo, fefelli, to counter-\nFelony, nance which they would have it called fellonia. Sir Edward Coke, as his manner is, has given us a still stranger etymology; that it is crimen animo felleo perpetratum, \"with a bitter or gallish inclination.\" But all of them agree in the description, that it is such a crime as works a forfeiture of all the offender's lands or goods. And this gives great probability to Sir Henry Spelman's Teutonic or German derivation of it: in which language, indeed, as the word is clearly of feudal origin, we ought rather to look for its signification, than among the Greeks and Romans. Felon then, according to him, is derived from two northern words: FEE, which signifies (we well know) the fief, feud, or beneficiary estate; and LON, which signifies price or value. Felony is therefore the same as pretium feudii, the consideration for which a man gives up his fief; as we say in common speech, such an act is as much as your life or estate is worth. In this sense it will clearly signify the feudal forfeiture, or act by which an estate is forfeited, or escheats to the lord.\n\nTo confirm this, we may observe, that it is in this sense, of forfeiture to the lord, that the feudal writers constantly use it. For all those acts, whether of a criminal nature or not, which at this day are generally forfeitures of copyhold estates, are styled felonies in the feudal law: \"si scilicet, per quas feudum amittitur.\" As \"si dominus deferviret nobiorem si per annum et diem essaverit in petenda invictura si dominum ejuravit, i.e. negavit se a domino feudum habere si a domino in jus eum vacante, ter citatus non comparuerit:\"\u2014all these, with many others, are still causes of forfeiture in our copyhold estates, and were denominated felonies by the feudal constitutions. So likewise injuries of a more substantial or criminal nature were denominated felonies, that is, forfeitures: as assaulting or beating the lord; vitiating his wife or daughter, \"si dominum cucurbitaverit,\" i.e. cum uxor ejus concubuerit; all these are esteemed felonies, and the latter is expressly so denominated, \"si fecerit feloniam, dominum forte cucurbitando.\" And as these contempts, or smaller offences, were felonies or acts of forfeiture, of course greater crimes, as murder and robbery, fell under the same denomination. On the other hand, the lord might be guilty of felony, or forfeit his feignory to the vassal, by the same act as the vassal would have forfeited his feud to the lord. \"Si dominus commisit feloniam, per quam vassalus amitteret feudum si cam committerit in dominium, feudii proprietatem etiam dominus perdere debet.\"\n\nOne instance given of this sort of felony in the lord is beating the servant of his vassal, so that he loses his service; which seems merely in the nature of a civil injury, so far as it respects the vassal. And all these felonies were to be determined, \"per laudamentum five judicium parium suorum,\" in the lord's court; as with us forfeitures of copyhold lands are presentable by the homage in the court-baron.\n\nFelony, and the act of forfeiture to the lord, being thus synonymous terms in the feudal law, we may callily trace the reason why, upon the introduction of that law into England, those crimes which induced such forfeiture or escheat of lands (and, by a small defection from the original sense, such as induced the forfeiture of goods also) were denominated felonies. Thus it was that suicide, robbery, and rape, were felonies; that is, the consequence of such crimes was forfeiture; till by long use we began to signify by the term of felony the actual crime committed, and not the penal consequence. And upon this system only can we account for the cause, why treason in ancient times was held to be a species of felony; viz. because it induced a forfeiture.\n\nHence it follows, that capital punishment does by no means enter into the true idea and definition of felony. Felony may be without inflicting capital punishment, as in the cases instances of self-murder, excusable homicide, and petit-larceny: and it is possible that capital punishments may be inflicted, and yet the offence be no felony; as in case of heresy by the common law, which, though capital, never worked any forfeiture of lands or goods, an inseparable incident to felony. And of the same nature was the punishment of standing mute, without pleading to an indictment; which at the common law was capital, but without any forfeiture, therefore such standing mute was no felony. In short, the true criterion of felony is forfeiture: for, as Sir Edward Coke justly observes, in all felonies which are punishable with death, the offender loses all his lands in fee-simple, and also his goods and chattels; in such as are not punishable, his goods and chattels only.\n\nThe idea of felony is indeed so generally connected with that of capital punishment, that we find it hard to separate them; and to this usage the interpretations of the law do now conform. And therefore, if a statute makes any new offence felony, the law implies that it shall be punished with death, viz. by hanging, as well as with forfeiture: unless the offender pays the benefit of clergy; which all felons are entitled once to have, unless the same is expressly taken away by statute.\n\nFelonies by statute are very numerous; and as this work will not admit of a proper enumeration, we must refer to the table of the quarto edition of the Statutes, where they are set forth in alphabetical order.","sp":205,"ep":206},{"h":"FELTING","t":"the method of working up hair or wool into a species of cloth, independent of either spinning or weaving. Felting in Britain is not much practised, except in the manufacturing of hats; and as the generality even of those who are employed in making them, are unacquainted with the principles on which they act, a few observations on the method of felting may, to such, be both useful and agreeable.\n\nIf wool, the hair of a rabbit, hare, beaver, or human-hair, be examined with a microscope of the greatest magnifying power, the surface of each hair appears perfectly smooth, or if any inequalities are observed, they do not appear so much to arise from an irregular surface, as from some peculiar difference in the colour and transparency of the substances examined; for if their image be viewed by a solar microscope, it terminates in even lines, without the smallest vestige of any roughness. Yet nothing is more evident than that the surfaces of hairs are not perfectly smooth, but either composed of lamellae covering each other from the root to the point, resembling the scales of fishes; or what some have deemed more\nmore probable, of zones placed over each other, similar to the structure of horns; and to this texture, hair, wool, &c., owe their disposition for what is denominated felting.\n\nLet a person take hold of a hair by the root with one hand, and draw it between two fingers of the other, from the root towards the point, he will scarcely perceive any friction, or hear any sound; but should he hold the hair by the point, and draw it between his fingers from the point towards the root, he will feel a sensible opposition or resistance which could not be felt before. A sort of tremulous motion is likewise produced, which can be distinguished by the ear. From this simple experiment it is obvious that the texture of the surface of a hair is not the same from the point to the root, as it is from the root to the point. If a hair is taken hold of by the fore-finger and thumb, and rubbed in a longitudinal direction, a progressive motion is the result, which is invariably towards the root. This is wholly independent of the texture or nature of the skin of the fingers; for if the hair be turned, and the point of it placed where the root formerly was, the movement becomes contrary, or, in other words, it is still directed towards the root.\n\nIt is found a very difficult task to untie a knot made in the middle of a hair, on account of its extreme thinness; but if the hair is placed in the bend of the hand, the knot being in a line with the little finger, and if the hair is grasped by closing the hand, and the fist struck several times against the knee, the knot is thereby opened, because the asperities of one end of the hair are in a contrary direction to those of the other, by which means each end of it recedes a little. By the introduction of a pin into the eye thus formed at the knot, it is easily untied. Although these observations have a direct reference to long hair; yet they are equally applicable to wool, furs, and almost every species of animal hair. The surfaces of all these consist of hard lamellae, placed upon each other like tiles, in the direction from the root to the point.\n\nBy attending to these remarks, it is easy to see why the contact of woollen stuffs is rough to the skin. The asperities on the surface of the fibres of wool produce a disagreeable sensation, by fixing themselves in the skin, which can only be endured by being accustomed to feel it frequently. The injury done to wounds by the application of wool, is not the result of any chemical property, but is entirely occasioned by the asperities of its surface.\n\nA hatter separates the hairs from each other, by striking the wool with the string of his bow, causing them to spring up in the air, which fall on the table in every possible direction, forming a layer of a particular thickness, which is covered by the workmen with a cloth, pressing it with his hands, and moving the hairs backwards and forwards in different directions. In this manner the hairs are brought against each other, and their points of contact considerably multiplied, and the agitation gives each hair a progressive motion towards the root, in consequence of which the hairs become twisted together. As the mass becomes compact, the pressure ought to be increased, in order to keep up the progressive motion and twisting of the hairs, which is then performed with greater difficulty.\n\nThe hair designed for the manufacturing of hats is always cut off with a sharp instrument, and not pulled out by the roots, because the bulb of the hair which would come out with it in the latter case, would render the end which was fixed in the skin very obtuse, and nearly destroy its disposition to unite with the adjacent hairs. But in addition to the tendency of hairs to move progressively towards the root, they should not be straight like needles, for in this case they could not produce any compactness in the stuff. The fibres of wool having naturally a crooked form, that substance is well adapted to the operation of felting. The hair of beavers, rabbits, hares, &c., being straight, it cannot be employed in felting by itself, till it has been subjected to a previous preparation, viz. rubbing and combing on the skin, the brush being dipped in a solution of mercury in nitric acid. This substance, by acting only on one side of the hairs, gives them that disposition to felting which is natural to wool.\n\nWhen it is not intended that the hairs shall enter into the body of the mass, but serve only as an external coating, which is sometimes given to the outer surface of hats, the operation with the nitric acid need not be performed. They must be uniformly spread upon the surface to which the coating is to be applied, and being covered with a cloth, it is pressed with the hands, and agitated for some time. They receive a particular direction afterwards by means of a brush, and are enabled to keep it by having a hot iron passed over them. Woollen cloth is thickened by fulling, on the same principles that wool and hair become capable of felting.\n\nFelt-Spar or Feld-Spar, a mineral substance.

See Bog and Draining, in Agriculture Index.\n\nFens are either made up of a congeries of bogs; or consist of a multitude of pools or lakes, with dry spots of land intermixed, like so many little islands.\n\nSeveral statutes have been made for the draining of fens, chiefly in Kent, Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, and Lincolnshire; and by a late act, 11 Geo. II. commissioners shall be appointed for the effectually draining and preserving of the fens in the Isle of Ely, who are authorized to make drains, dams, and proper works thereon; and they may charge the landholders therein with a yearly acre-tax, and in default of payment, sell the defender's lands.\n\nThe wet grounds called *fens*, in Lincolnshire and elsewhere in England, bring many advantages to the inhabitants of those counties. Fowl and fish are very plentiful in them. The pike and eels are large and easily caught, but they are usually coarse. The duck, mallard, and teal, are in such plenty as is scarce to be conceived. They are taken by decoys in prodigious flocks at a time. They send these fowl from Lincolnshire to London, twice a-week, on horseback, from Michaelmas to Lady-day; and one decoy will furnish 20 dozen, or more, twice a-week, for the whole season in this manner. The decoy-men contract with the people, who bring them to London at a certain rate, and they are obliged to take off their hands the whole number that is catched. Two teal are usually reckoned equal to one duck; and five ducks and twelve teal are accounted a dozen of wild fowl; and the usual market price is about 9s. for such a dozen. About midsummer, during the moulting season, a great number also are destroyed by the people in the neighbourhoods. The poor birds at this season are neither able to swim nor fly well; and the people going in with boats among the reeds where they lie, knock them down with long poles. A little before Michaelmas, vast flights of these birds arrive at the decoys from other places; they soon grow fat in them, and continue there a prey to the masters or owners, as long as the decoys are unfrozen; but, when they are iced over, they fly away again, and go to the neighbouring seas for food.\n\nThe fens also abound in a sort of herbage that is very nourishing to cattle. Sheep and horses always grow fat upon it. The fens are common, and the owners of cattle mark them that they may be known.\n\nIt is remarkable, that, though all is open, the cattle used to one particular spot of ground seldom leave it, but the owner may always find them in or near the same place. The fens have many large and deep drains. In these the pike and eel grow to a vast size; and they are full of geese which feed on the grass; but these eat rank and muddy, and may even be found as soon as a person comes into the room where they are roosting. But the people have another very great advantage from these birds besides the eating of them, namely, their feathers and quills; and the produce of these is so great, that the customhouse books in the town of Bollton show, that there are frequently sent away in one year 300 bags of feathers, each containing a hundred and a half weight. Each pound of feathers brings in the owner twopence; and it may be thought strange by people unacquainted with these things, but it is a certain truth, that the owners pull them five or six times a year for the feathers, and three times for the quills. Each pulling comes to about a pound, and many people have 1000 geese at a time, or more. They are kept at no charge, except in deep snowy weather, when they are obliged to feed them with corn.\n\nOats also grow very well in many of the fen countries, and in good seasons bring great increase and advantage to the owners. There is also another vegetable of great profit to them. This is the *rapum fibrofre*; the feed of which they call *cole-feed*; and they make an oil from it of great use in trade. They grind the feed between two large stones, the one standing perpendicularly on the other. The stones are made of a sort of black marble, and are brought from Germany. They sometimes turn them by sails, and sometimes by the drains which carry off the water from the fen lands.\n\nThe fens lying low, and being of a vast extent, are very subject to be overflowed by waters from the neighbouring high countries; and though great care and expense is used to keep them dry, they are often like a sea; and the sheep are obliged to be carried off in boats, and the people to live in their upper rooms, and to be supplied with provisions also with boats.","sp":208,"ep":208},{"h":"FENCE","t":"in Gardening and Husbandry, a hedge, wall, ditch, bank, or other enclosure, made round gardens, fields, woods, &c.\n\nIn hot climates, where they have not occasion for walls to ripen their fruit, their gardens lie open, where they can have a water fence, and prospects; or else they bound their gardens with groves, in which are fountains, walks, &c., which are much more pleasing to the sight than a dead wall; but, in colder countries, we are obliged to have walls to shelter and ripen our fruit, although they take away much from the pleasant prospect of the garden. Brick walls are accounted the best and warmest for fruit: and these walls, being built panel-wise, with pillars at equal distances, will save a great deal of charge, in that the walls may be built thinner than if they were made plain without these panels, for then it would be necessary to build them thicker everywhere; and, besides, these panels make the walls look the handsomer. Stone walls, however, on account of their durability, are to be preferred to those of brick, especially those of square hewn stones. Those that are made of rough stones, though\nthough they are very dry and warm, yet, by reason of their unevenness, are inconvenient to nail up trees to, except pieces of timber be laid in them here and there for that purpose.\n\nBut, in large gardens, it is better to have the prospect open to the pleasure garden; which should be surrounded with a fence, that from the garden the adjacent country may be viewed. But this must depend on the situation of the place: for, if the prospect from the garden is not good, it had better be shut out from the sight than be open. As also, when a garden lies near a populous town, and the adjoining grounds are open to the inhabitants; if the garden is open, there will be no walking there in good weather, without being exposed to the view of all passersby, which is very disagreeable.\n\nWhere the fences are made round a garden which is situated in a park, they are extremely proper; because hereby the prospect of the park will be obtained in the garden, which renders those gardens much more agreeable than those that are confined.\u2014In the making these fences there have been many inventions; but, upon the whole, none seem preferable to those which have an upright wall next the garden, which (where the soil will admit of a deep trench) should be five or six feet high; and, from the foot of this wall, the ground on the outside should rise with a gradual easy slope, to the distance of 18 or 20 feet; and where it can be allowed, if it slopes much farther it will be easier, and less perceptible as a ditch, to the eye, when viewed at a distance; but, if the ground is naturally wet, so as not to admit a deep fence, then, in order to make a fence against cattle, if the wall be four feet high, and flight posts of three feet high are placed just behind the wall, with a small chain carried on from post to post, no cattle or deer will ever attempt to jump against it; therefore it will be a secure fence against them; and if these are painted green, they will not be discerned at a distance, and at the same time the chain will secure persons walking in the garden from tumbling over.\n\nIn places where there are no good prospects to be obtained from a garden, it is common to make the enclosure of park palings; which, if well performed, will last many years, and has a much better appearance than a wall; and this pale may be hid from the sight within, by plantations of shrubs and evergreens; or there may be a quick hedge planted within the pale, which may be trained up, so as to be an excellent fence by the time the pales begin to decay.\n\nFences round parks are generally of palings; which, if well made of winter-fallen oak, will last many years. But a principal thing to be observed, in making these pales, is not to make them too heavy: for, when they are so, their own weight will cause them to decay; therefore the pales should be cleft thin; and the rails should be cut triangular, to prevent the wet lodging upon them; and the posts should be good, and not placed too far asunder. If these things are observed, one of these pales will last, with a little care, upwards of 40 years very well. The common way of making these fences is, to have every other pale nine or ten inches above the intermediate ones; so that the fence may be six feet and a half high, which is enough for fallow deer; but, where there are red deer, the fence should be one foot higher, otherwise they will leap over.\n\nSome enclose their parks with brick walls; and in countries where stone is cheap, the walls are built with this material; some with, and others without, mortar.\n\nA kitchen garden, if rightly contrived, will contain walling enough to afford a supply of such fruits as require the affluence of walls, for any family; and this garden, being situated on one side, and quite out of sight of the house, may be surrounded with walls which will screen the kitchen garden from the sight of persons in the pleasure garden; and, being locked up, the fruit will be much better preserved than it can be in the public garden; and the having too great a quantity of walling is often the occasion that so many ill managed trees are frequently to be seen in large gardens.\n\nThe height of garden walls should be 12 feet, which is a moderate proportion; and, if the soil be good, it may in time be well furnished with bearing wood in every part, especially that part planted with pears, notwithstanding of the branches being trained horizontally from the bottom of the walls.\n\nWith regard to the different kinds of fences, see Agriculture Index.\n\nFence-Month, the month wherein deer begin to fawn, during which it is unlawful to hunt in the forest.\n\nIt commences 15 days before Midsummer, and ends 15 days after it.

In 1689, he was appointed tutor to the dukes of Burgundy and Anjou; and in 1655 was consecrated archbishop of Cambrai. After this preferment, a storm arose against him, that obliged him to leave the court forever, occasioned by his performance entitled, An Explanation of the Maxims of the Saints concerning the Interior Life; in which he supposed to favour the extravagant notions of Madame Guyon, and the principles of Quietism. A controversy on this occasion was for some time carried on between him and M. Boiflet, bishop of Meaux; which terminated in an appeal to the pope; when his holiness condemned the archbishop's book, by a brief dated March 12, 1699. Some friends indeed pretend, that there was more of court policy than religious zeal in this affair; but be this as it may, the archbishop submitted patiently to this determination; and, retiring to his diocese of Cambrai, acquitted himself punctually in all the duties of his station, and led a most exemplary life. The work that gained him the greatest reputation, and which will render his memory immortal, is his Adventures of Telemachus; the style of which is natural, the fictions well contrived, the moral sublime, and the political maxims tending all to the happiness of mankind.

About 12 centuries ago, this system was so universally received in Europe, that Sir Henry Spelman calls it the law of nations in our western world. Hence it deserves our attention in a particular manner; a knowledge of the different feuds being indispensably requisite for a proper understanding either of the civil government of our own country, or of the laws by which its landed property is regulated.\n\nThe military policy of the Celtic or northern nations, known by the names of Goths, Vandals, Franks, Huns, and Lombards, furnished the original constitution or system of feuds. These people pouring out in vast multitudes from the same officina gentium or \"storehouse of nations,\" overran all the European countries on the declension of the Roman empire. They brought the feudal system along with them from the countries out of which they emigrated; and, supposing it to be the most proper method of securing their new conquests, they introduced it into their more southerly colonies.\n\nAccording to this system, the victorious general allotted considerable tracts of land to his principal officers; while they, in like manner, divided their possessions among the inferior officers, and even those common soldiers who were thought to be the most deserving. Allotments of this kind were named feoda, fiefs, fees, or feuds, from a combination of words, in the language of these barbarians, signifying a reward or stipend bestowed on certain conditions (a). The condition upon which these rewards were given was, that the possessors should faithfully serve the person from whom they were received, both at home and abroad, in the military way. To this they engaged themselves by a juramentum fidelitatis, or oath of fealty;\u2020 in the event of a breach of which, either by not performing the service due, or by transposing these two northern syllables,\n\n(A) We were informed by Pontopiddan, that odh in these northern languages is the same with proprietas, and dovall: in ALL with totum in the Latin. Hence among the northern nations, he tells us, that odhall signifies right; fin, part 2, and hence we may conjecture that the udal right in Finland is derived \u2020. By transposing these two northern syllables,\nservice agreed upon, by deserting their lord in time of battle, &c., the lands were to return to their original possessor.\n\nThus the possessors of feudal allotments became interested in the defense of them; and not only the receivers but those who gave them, were equally and mutually bound to defend their possessions, none of them being able to pretend any right but that of conquest. For this purpose government and subordination were absolutely necessary; it being impossible to conduct any system of defense where every thing was tumultuous and irregular. Every person, therefore, who was a feudatory, i.e. who had received lands, was bound to do everything in his power to defend the lord of his fee; while, on the other hand, the latter was no less subordinate to his immediate superior; and so on to the prince himself. In like manner a reciprocal bond of defense existed down from the prince to the lowest feudists.\n\nSuch were the foundations on which the feudal system was properly established; and the natural consequence was, a military subjection throughout the whole community. The prince could always collect an army of feudatories ready to defend not only the kingdom in general, but the particular possessions of each person; and the propriety of this constitution was soon apparent in the strength which these newly erected kingdoms acquired, and the valor with which their conquests were defended.\n\nBesides these feudal grants, however, which were held only on the terms of military service above mentioned, there were others called allodial, which were given upon more enlarged principles. To these every free man had a title; and could not only claim his territory as well as the rest, but dispose of it at his pleasure (n); and this freedom was denominated allodality. These allodials, however, were not exempted from military service. A part of their freedom consisted in liberty to go to the wars; for this, in the barbarous times we speak of, was the only way to acquire any degree of renown. Only the slaves were defined to follow the arts of peace; while every free person was not only at liberty to defend his country, but under an obligation to do it in case of any urgent necessity.\n\nThus there was a feudal and a national militia. The feudal and free people only were allowed to possess property; the national feudal vassals constituted the army, properly so called; militia, while the national militia was composed of the allodial proprietors. This allodality, however, was not confined to landed property, but included likewise moveable estates or money; so that proprietors of the latter kind were obliged also in times of danger to bear arms and appear in the field. Between the feudal and different allodial proprietors, however, there was this farther situation difference, that the latter had no concern with any of the feudal lords themselves; so that they were never obliged to appear in the field unless when called forth by the sovereign against the enemies of the nation at large. This circumstance we might suppose to be an advantage, but it ultimately operated otherwise; becoming the means of changing the allodial right into a feudal tenure. For some time the holders of fiefs had an eminent advantage over the allodial proprietors. This was owing to the imperfection of government in those days; so that the nobles had it in their power to revenge their own quarrels, while the weak were equally exposed to the insults of both parties. The lord and his vassals therefore were always formidable; but the allodial\n\n---\n\n(b) The author of *A View of Society in Europe*, has traced the remote sources of the feudal laws in an elegant and spirited manner (book i. chap. ii. sect. i.) Tacitus informs us, that the individuals of each of the German nations cultivated by turns a tract of land proportionate to their number, for the use of the whole; after which each individual received such an allotment of the cultivated tract as his dignity seemed to require. These nations had not altered their political principles at the time they overran the Roman empire; and hence the provinces of it were then divided after the same manner. The most considerable allotment was bestowed on the king, as being the most dignified person in the community, and this allotment was styled his domain; while the shares of citizens and warriors, which were likewise in proportion to the merit or dignity of each, constituted what was called allodality. But as it often happened that all the land was not exhausted by these partitions, what remained was considered as the property of the community, and in the barbaric codes was called the lands of the fisc. In such German nations as had thus obtained a settlement, it was necessary that there should be a more close connexion betwixt the sovereign and the chiefs, as well as between the chiefs and people, than in others. This was effected by means of the lands of the fisc; for of these the sovereign took possession, dealing them out to the chiefs under the burden of appearing in arms whenever he should please to call; while the chiefs in like manner dealt out lands to those called their retainers, who were also obliged to supply them with military alliance in cases of necessity. Hence a political system was founded, which had a prodigious effect on society in all those countries where it prevailed. The intention and tendency of this system was to render the nation independent both at home and abroad; for, while the people were all armed in their common defense, individuals were also properly guarded against the attacks of depopulation. The power of the chiefs, who formed a regular nobility, was a counterpoise to that of the sovereign; while the number of the retainers and vassals, constituting the greatness and power of the nobility, was a proper barrier against aristocratical oppression; for a chief who oppressed his vassals evidently acted against his own interest.\nFeudal proprietors had scarce any means of defending themselves. The reason of this was, in the first place, that the law did not allow them to commit any hostilities; and in the next, they were too distant and unconnected to form any proper league for mutual defense; and hence proceeded the necessity already hinted at, of converting allodial property into feudal tenure. This was indeed owing in a great measure to the absurdity and violence of the times, by which gifts of property, burdened with service, and which might return to the person who granted them, were rendered superior in value to the absolute and unconditional possession of a subject. Other considerations, however, besides those just mentioned, contributed to produce the same effect. As in those dark ages no right existed but what had its origin in conquest, it thence followed, that the greatest conqueror or warrior was the most honourable person. The king, in whom the whole exploits of the community centered, as being their head, was the most honourable person: all others derived from him that portion of honour which they enjoyed, and which was most nicely adjusted in proportion as they approached him. Allodial proprietors, therefore, having no pretensions of this kind, were treated with contempt as a kind of poltroons. From this disagreeable situation they wished to free themselves, by converting their allodial property into feudal tenures; while the princes, supposing it their interest to extend those tenures as much as possible, discouraged the allodial possessions. As the feudists supported the conversion of the nation and dignity of the monarch, of allodium it was not thought proper to allow the allodial proprietors any greater compensations than what were given to vassals in similar cases. Thus they were exposed to continual mortifications in the courts of justice: they were neglected by the king; denied sufficient protection from the laws; exposed not only to continual insults; but to have their property on all occasions destroyed by the great: so that they were without resource except from the feudal tenures, and were obliged even to solicit the privileges which were bestowed in other cases on vassals. In these unhappy circumstances, they were glad to yield up their lands to any superior whom they thought most agreeable, and to receive them back from him as a feudal gift. Thus the landed property was everywhere changed into feudal tenures, and fiefs became universal (c).\n\nFor some time the feudal system was not only useful in itself, but honourable in its principles; but this continued no longer than while the importers of it into Europe adhered to their original simple and noble maxims. During that period, the lord exercised his bounty.\n\n(c) It has been an object of inquiry to the learned, in what nation of barbarians fiefs had their origin? But it is probable, that they took place in all these nations nearly about the same time, on the same principles; and were continued by reason of a similarity of manners, conquests, &c., so that we cannot ascribe the prevalence of them to imitation.\n\nIn France, we find mention made of fiefs as early as the age of Childebert. They were introduced into Italy by the Lombards; amongst whom the customs and laws relating to fiefs seem very early to have made rapid advances*. They were introduced into Spain before the invasion of the Moors and Saracens in the year 710. Lands were granted for service and attachment among the Goths; among whom also the person who received the gift was the retainer of him who granted it. If he refused his service, the grant was forfeited, and he was said to receive it in patronio; he also swore fealty to his lord; and on this footing the national militia was regulated\u2020. There can be very little doubt that the feudal law was known in England in the Saxon times, as is mentioned in the text. In Scotland, however, the history of fiefs is still more uncertain than anywhere else; which has been ascribed partly to the mutilated state of the Scottish records, and partly to the want of able antiquaries in the nation. But, according to a late writer\u2021, allodiality and feudalism have existed ever since the foundation of the Scottish monarchy, and have most probably arisen from a familiarity of the manners and customs in Scotland to those of other nations. It has indeed been supposed, that these customs were introduced from some foreign model by Malcolm II. According to some, they were introduced directly from England; and the policy of Malcolm in establishing them has been highly extolled: but, according to our author, there is no foundation for any notion of that kind. Both the opinions just mentioned either directly assert or imply, that the feudal maxims were introduced into this country upon the principle of imitation; but it is very improbable that they could be imported from one people to another, on account of their excessive contrariety to the common usages and precepts of government among mankind. It must undoubtedly have been very absurd, if not altogether impracticable, to transplant the feudal tenures when the grants of land were precarious, or depending entirely on the will of the prince, to a country which had never known superiority or vassalage. This would have required an alteration of all the orders of society from the king to the peasant; while the whole chain of customs, as well as the jurisdiction of the kingdom, both high and low, must have sustained a corresponding alteration, in order to conform them to the new system. It is likewise obvious, that no conquest could be made on purpose to obtain a settlement by any nation who had already received the knowledge of fiefs. The establishment of them implied, that the people had already a fixed and settled residence; and accordingly history does not furnish us with any account of a nation among whom fiefs were known, who ever migrated from the country they already possessed, to seek for one in which they might settle. Feudal institutions must have originated wherever they have been observed to flourish.\u2014Scotland was formerly a feudal kingdom, and we know pretty nearly the time when the fiefs were hereditary there; but in that form they could not be introduced by the sovereign; and there was not any nation among whom fiefs were already known who conquered, or made an establishment by conquest, in Scotland. Fiefs therefore must have gradually advanced to such a state of perfection. The progress they made may be likewise easily\nbounty to the vassal, which the latter repaid by acts of gratitude; so that the intercourse between them was of the most tender and affectionate kind; and this gave rise to what are called the feudal incidents.\n\nThe expectants of fiefs were educated in the hall of the superior, while the tenures were precarious or only for life; and even when they became hereditary, the lord took care of the son and estate of his deceased vassal; not only protecting his person, but taking charge of his education, and directing the management of his affairs. He took pleasure in observing his approach to maturity; and when he came of age, never failed to deliver to him the lands, with the care of which he had been intrusted, and which he had been careful to improve. This was called the incident of wardship.\n\nThe incident of relief was founded upon the gratitude of the vassal; who, upon entering on his fief, brought a present to his lord, as an acknowledgment of his care of him during the early part of his life; and in order to conciliate his future regard.\n\nThe incident of marriage proceeded also upon the principle of gratitude on the part of the vassal. The latter, conscious of the favours he had received, did not choose to ally himself with a family inimical to his chief; while the superior himself, ambitious to aggrandize and augment the importance of his family, sought how to find the most advantageous match for his vassal.\n\nSometimes the superior himself was reduced in his circumstances by war or other accident; but from whatever cause his distress proceeded, even though it had arisen from his own extravagance or prodigality, or when only destitute of means to support his ambition or grandeur, his vassals were bound to support and relieve him according to their circumstances; and this was called the incident of aid.\n\nThe incident of escheat took place on the part of the vassal, when, through cowardice, treachery, or any remarkable misbehaviour, he rendered himself unworthy of his fief. In that case, the taking it from him, and giving it to one more worthy, was called an escheat.\n\nWhile the lords and vassals thus vied with one another in mutual acts of friendship and benevolence, universal happiness, liberty, and activity, were diffused throughout the society. The vassals behaved courteously towards the retainers, who were immediately below them; while they again were courted by the lords as constituting their importance and strength; the lords, lastly, giving a like importance and dignity to the sovereign himself. Thus a regular, powerful, and compact system of government took place; an unanimity and attention pervaded the various departments of state; so that, while the subjects were free, the nation at large was formidable.\n\nDuring this happy state of affairs, the members of the national assembly in every country in Europe appeared there in arms, whether they came personally or by their representatives. Such particularly was the case under the Anglo-Saxon government; and the happiness they at that time enjoyed made the oppression and tyranny of the Normans appear the more intolerable.\n\nIn process of time, however, the state of society began to suffer a remarkable alteration. The high and disinterested notions, from which the happiness above mentioned took its origin, declined; the romantic ideas of chivalry ceased; and much more interested notions of property came in their stead. The separation of the interests of the lords from their vassals was the first step towards the destruction of the feudal system. Thus the incidents, which, as has just now been mentioned, promoted their happiness, did the very reverse. Property being now looked upon as a distinction superior to personal merit, naturally introduced the most mercenary views. In consequence of these the infant ward, the care of whom was wont to be considered as a sacred and honorary trust, was now only looked upon as a means of procuring emolument to the superior. The latter now regarded the profits of his vassals as so many diminutions of his own wealth. Instead of taking care to improve the estate of his ward as formerly, he impoverished it; not only neglecting the education of the heir, but offering insults to himself; inasmuch that the relations of the unfortunate vassal were frequently obliged to ransom from the avaricious superior both his person and effects. By merchandise of this kind the coffers of princes were filled, and wardships let out to strangers, who might exercise their rapacity with greater freedom. When the vassal at last attained the years of maturity, he came to the possession of his land without any of that joy and festivity which usually took place on the occasion. He received an inheritance wasted and destroyed, while new grievances daily presented themselves to augment the horrors of his situation. All the incidents, which in former times oppressed were so many expressions of gratitude on the part of the situation of vassal, were now changed into taxes which might be exacted at the pleasure of the lord. Before the vassal was invested in his land, the superior exacted from him a certain sum or other gift, to be measured only by his own rapacity; and in case of delay or inability to pay this demand, the superior continued in possession of the estate. Such scandalous oppression could not but produce the greatest discontent and clamour. Applications were made to the law without success; nor were even the laws regarded which were fabricated on purpose for their relief. The incident of marriage now proved a source of the most dreadful oppression. The lord assumed a right of marrying his vassal to whom he pleased; and he not only exerted this right himself, but would sell it to a stranger, or allow the vassal to buy it himself; while the penalty annexed to a marriage without\nout the consent of the superior involved no less punishment than the loss of the estate itself, or some grievous infliction as for a crime of the first magnitude. The case was still worse with the female ward; whose beauty and accomplishments became a source of gain to the superior, or were sacrificed to please his whims or caprices; so that her relations were frequently obliged to buy from him the privilege of marrying her to the person she or they thought most proper. In like manner the aid, which was formerly a voluntary gift from the vassal in cases of distress happening to his lord, now became an unavoidable tax. An aid formerly was demanded when the eldest daughter of the superior was married, when his eldest son was knighted, or when the superior himself was taken prisoner in battle. These were the only legal causes of making a demand of this kind; but in the subsequent times of degeneracy, the most frivolous pretences were every day made use of by the prince to oppress the lords, and by the lords to oppress their vassals; demanding subsidies at pleasure, which their inferiors were always obliged to comply with. Lastly, the efcheat, which in former times took place only in cases of cowardice, treachery, or some other heinous crime, was now inflicted on the most trifling occasions. If the vassal happened to be too long in attending the court of his superior to take the oath of fealty; if he committed any action which could in the least be construed an infringement of the oath; if he neglected to give his lord warning of any misfortune which he might suppose was about to befall him; revealed any thing concerning him; made love to his sister or daughter, &c.; or even if he should grant a tenure of land to another person in form different from that in which he held his own; all these, nay others still more ridiculous, were judged sufficient reasons for the superior to seize on the estate of the vassal, and involve him and his family in ruin.\n\nNotwithstanding these oppressions, however, the vassal was still obliged to submit to his lord; to own him as his superior; and even, in appearance, to pay him the same respect as formerly when the greatest unanimity and cordial affection subsisted between them. Still he was obliged to perform the same military service; because a failure in that respect would have subjected him to a forfeiture of lands according to the original agreement. A vast difference, however, now took place in the valour and activity which inspired the army. The vassals, forced into the field with desponding hearts, were indifferent as to the success of the cause in which they were engaged, and frequently obstructed instead of forwarding the operations of the field. Hence the sovereign found himself embarrassed; and, though nominally at the head of a martial and powerful people, was frequently unable to effect anything, by reason of the mutual hatred and diffusion which everywhere prevailed.\n\nThus the feudal states of Europe became unnaturally weak: a remedy was necessary; and it is remarkable that the same remedy was applied all over the continent. This was, in short, the making fiefs hereditary, which till now had only been granted for a long term of years; and, in return, burdening the lands with a certain number of soldiers, which were not to be refused upon any pretence whatever. Hence was derived the tenure of knight-service. A certain portion of land, invention burdened with the service of one soldier or knight, was called a knight's fee; and thus an estate, furnishing any service, number of soldiers, was paid to contain as many knight's fees; so that now the manors, baronies, &c., became powerful according to the number of soldiers they were bound to furnish. In the grants from the crown, the nobility were obliged to furnish a certain number of soldiers for the service of the sovereign; and in those from the nobility to their vassals, the like service was required. Even the commons who had grants from the crown furnished a certain proportion of knights. The force of the nation was called into action by grants in capitae, or from the sovereign and nobility. A numerous and powerful army was instantly assembled, and at once ready for action. Of this army the king was the general, the nobility the officers, and the vassals soldiers; the whole being exactly arranged, and capable of entering upon any expedition without the least delay.\n\nThus a remedy was found in some measure for the weaknesses of the feudal sovereigns; but though the knights' tenure could accomplish this, it could not bring back the former affection and cordiality which subsisted between the various ranks of people. On the contrary, by uniting them more firmly to one another by legal ties, it rendered matters rather worse. The oppression originating from the operation of the feudal incidents, still continued with unremitting violence. The grants of knights' tenure were attended with the same oaths of homage and fealty; the same incidents of relief, wardship, marriage, aid, and efcheat, with the feudal tenures. The princes promised to abate somewhat of their rigour in demanding the feudal perquisites, but did not keep their word. Laws were occasionally promulgated, and for some time had an effect; but palliatives soon became ineffectual, and a new state of weakness began to commence.\n\nThe two remarkable eras in the feudal history are, the time before the invention of knight-service (D), and the history that during which it continued. Fiefs were in a state of fluctuation from the destruction of the Roman empire till the ninth century; but they were rendered perpetual in France about the year 877, and were generally become so in every country of Europe about the beginning of the tenth. Du Cange, voce Militia, gives us an example of a knight fee in the year 830. By the year 987, when Hugh Capet was raised to the throne of France, knight service was become general all over Europe, and was introduced into England after having introduced its appearance in other countries (E). In England, however, there have been several doubts and inquiries land, into England.\nquires among the learned concerning the introduction of the feudal laws. Many are of opinion, that they were first introduced by William the Conqueror; and consequently, that they were entirely unknown to the Anglo-Saxons: but others think, that they existed among the latter in the same form under which they were continued by the Normans. Dr Stuart is of opinion that the Saxons who settled in England could not be strangers to fiefs. He supposes the conformity of manners, which undoubtedly prevailed between the Saxons and other barbarians, a sufficient proof that the hereditary grant of land, as well as the fluctuating state of feudal tenures which preceded it, were known to the former. Collateral proofs are derived from the spirit and tenure of the Anglo-Saxon laws, but especially from the grants of hereditary estates on condition of military service (f). The condition of fiefs under the Anglo-Saxons was very different from what it was afterwards. In their times we find no mention made of these oppressions of which so much notice has already been taken; and this may easily be accounted for from the alteration of the feudal spirit in different ages. During the time that a warm and generous affection subsisted between the feudal superiors and vassals, the incidents were marks of generosity on the one part, and gratitude on the other; but as soon as a variance had taken place, by reason of the interested disposition which the introduction of luxury produced, the same incidents became sources of the most flagrant oppression. This was remarkably the case in the time of William the Conqueror; and, during the reign of King John, matters were come to such a crisis, that the people everywhere complained loudly, and demanded the restoration of the laws of Edward the Confessor (c). \"What these laws of Edward the Confessor were (says Mr Hume), which the English every reign during a century and a half desired so passionately to have restored, is much disputed by antiquarians; and our ignorance of them seems one of the greatest defects of the ancient English history.\" Dr Stuart has offered an explanation; but this is in fact no more than a conflation of conjecture, that \"by the laws or customs of the Confessor, then by that condition of felicity was expressed which had been enjoyed during the fortunate state of the feudal association. The cordiality, equality, and independence, which then prevailed among all ranks in society, continued to be remembered in less prosperous times, and occasioned an ardent desire for the revival of those laws and usages which were the sources of so much happiness.\"\n\nBesides the great distinction (of which an account Distinction has already been given) between the state of fiefs under concerning the Anglo-Saxons and under the Normans, they were fiefs in no less distinguished by the introduction of knight-service. Hitherto the refinement of the English had been obstructed by the invasion of the Danes, and the man times infaral situation of the kingdom; but after the Norman conquest the fiefs were made perpetual. Still, however, the knight-fee and knight-service were altogether unknown. William, the sixth prince who enjoyed the duchy of Normandy, was well acquainted with every thing relating to fiefs; for that duchy had experienced all the variety incidental to them from the time of its being granted to Rollo by Charles the Simple in the year 912, to the year 1066, when William was put in possession of England by the battle of Hastings.\n\nOn his accession to the throne, a number of forfeitures took place among those who had followed the fortune of Harold. Their estates were to be disposed of at the pleasure of the conqueror; and it was natural to suppose that he would follow the method practised in\n\nwas known in Scotland, and that it was not a novelty at that time. The same author thinks it even probable, that it was known in the time of David I.\n\n(f) The use of entails was known to the Anglo-Saxons; and this practice, as well as the succession to alodial estates, must have contributed very much to establish hereditary fiefs. This opinion seems also to be confirmed by the accounts we have of the great power of many of the nobility among the Anglo-Saxons, and the natural tendency that fiefs must have, in the course of things, to become perpetual, though analogical arguments cannot entirely be depended upon in this case. There is indeed positive evidence that the territory which anciently constituted the kingdom of Mercia belonged to Ethelred as an hereditary fief and carolm. The grant was given him by Alfred when he married his daughter Ethelfleda: and it is likewise attested by Camden, that in the time of Ethelred the earldom of Leicester was an inheritance, and the regular succession of its earls is still known. We are informed also by creditable historians, that Bernicia and Deireland were feudal and inheritable earldoms among the Saxons. The same was true of the county of Cumberland when possessed by the Scottish monarchs. This last appears from the Saxon Chronicle: in which the grant was conveyed by Edmund king of England to Malcolm of Scotland in the following terms: \"Edmundus rex totam Cumberland praedavit et contrivit, et commendavit eam Malcomo regi Scotiae; hoc pacto, quod in auxilio fibi foret terra et mari.\" From the use of the word commendavit, indeed, Spelman takes occasion to say, that a feudal homage was not intended; but the contrary may be proved by the original Saxon from which the foregoing is a Latin translation; and the word, according to several learned critics, signifies feudal homage with the most strict propriety. Thus Du Cange informs us, that commendare se aliqui was the general expression for faire l'hommage a un suzerain.\n\n(g) The laws which are now extant under the name of Edward, are generally allowed to be of doubtful authenticity; nor are they, even supposing them to be genuine, of any use in answering the present question. They determine indeed the existence of fiefs among the Anglo-Saxons: and Dr Stuart is of opinion, that the compilation which goes under the name of this prince, though posterior to the date it bears, nevertheless merits greater attention than has usually been bestowed upon it. M. Honard, a foreign lawyer, is the latest writer who has made it his study; but he is better acquainted with the Norman than the Anglo-Saxon customs.\nin his own country. Hence the origin of knight-service in England. A grant of land, to any person whatever, was estimated at a certain number of knights fees; and each of these required the service of a knight. The grants of lands were even renewed to the old tenants under this tenure; so that by degrees the whole military people in the kingdom acquiesced in it. To accomplish this, *Domesday Book*, is supposed to have been compiled, which contained an exact account of all the landed property of the kingdom.\u2014Hence it is to be concluded, not that William introduced fiefs into England, as some have imagined, but that he brought them to their ultimate state of perfection by the introduction of knight-service. This is evident from the laws enacted during his reign. In these it is not only mentioned that knight-service was enacted, but that it was done expressly with the consent of the common council of the nation; which at that time was equivalent to an act of parliament (H).\n\nThe invention of knight-service proved generally agreeable: for as only few of the Anglo-Saxon fiefs were hereditary, the advancement of the rest to perpetuity, under the tenure of knight-service, must have been accounted an acquisition of some importance; as not only augmenting the grandeur and dignity of the sovereign, but securing the independence of the subject, and improving his property. In the happy state of the feudal association, there was indeed no necessity for the knight\u2019s fee; but when the discordance and oppression so often mentioned began to take place, it became then necessary to point out particularly every duty of the vassal, as well as of the lord; and this was fully done by the invention of knight-service. The nobles possessed duchies, baronies, and earldoms; which extensive possessions were divided into as many fees, each of them to furnish a knight for the service of the king, or of the superior; so that every feudal state could command a numerous army and militia to support and defend it in case of any emergency. The knights were also bound to assemble in complete armour whenever the superior thought proper to call, and to hold themselves in readiness for action whenever the king or superior found it convenient to take the field: so that thus the militia might be marched at the shortest notice to defend or support the honour of the nation.\n\nThe knights were usually armed with a helmet, sword, lance, and shield; and each was besides obliged to keep a horse. This last requisite was owing to the contempt into which the infantry had fallen through the prevalence of tournaments and luxuries of various kinds, though it was by means of the infantry that the barbarians had originally distinguished themselves in their wars with the Romans, and became able to cope with the celebrated warriors. All proprietors of fees or tenants by knight-service fought on foot: the cavalry were distinguished by the name of battle; and the success of every encounter was supposed to depend on them alone. They only were completely armed; the infantry, being furnished by the villages under the jurisdiction of the barons, had at first only bows and lances; though afterwards they were found worthy of much greater attention.\n\nWhile the feudal association remained in perfection, its inefficacy and corruption was such that the superior could at any time command the military service of his vassals; but in the subsequent degeneracy this service could neither be depended upon when wanted, nor was it of the same advantage when obtained as formerly. The invention of knight-service tended in a great degree to remedy this inconvenience. Those who were possessed of knights fees were now obliged to remain 40 days in the field at their own expense; and this without exception, from the greatest crown vassals to the smallest feudatories; but if longer service was required, the prince was obliged to pay his troops. In those times, however, when the fate of nations was frequently decided by a single battle, a continuance in the field for 40 days was sufficient for ordinary occasions.\n\nThus matters seemed once more to be restored nearly to their former state. It was now, as much as ever, the interest of the nation to act with unanimity in its defence, not only against foreign enemies, but against the tyranny of the prince over his subjects, or of one part of the subjects over the other. New inconveniences, however, soon began to take place, owing to the gradual improvements in life and the refinement of manners. From the first institution of military service, a fine had been accepted instead of actual appearance in the field. In the times of barbarity, however, when men accounted rapine and bloodshed their only glory, there were but few who made an offer of this compensation; but as wealth and luxury increased, and the manners of people became softer, a general unwillingness of following the army into the field became also prevalent. A new tenure, called *efuage*, was therefore introduced, by which the vassal was only obliged to pay his superior a sum of money annually, instead of attending him into the field *. Hence originated taxes and their misapplication; for as the king was lord paramount of the whole kingdom, it thence happened that the whole efuage money collected under the throughout the nation centred in him. The princes and then, instead of recruiting their armies, frequently filled their coffers with the money, or dissipated it other-wise, hiring mercenaries to defend their territories when threatened with any danger. These being commanding posted of the chiefs of the people, and disbanded at the armies, &c.\n\n---\n\n(H) The following law of William the Conqueror not only makes express mention of the knight\u2019s fee and service, but alludes to a former law of William and his parliament, by which this tenure was actually established.\n\n\"Statutumus etiam et firmiter praecipimus, ut omnes comites, et barones, et milites, et servientes, et universi liberari homines totius regni nostri praedicti, habeant et teneant se semper bene in armis et in equis, ut decet et oportet, et quod sint semper prompti et bene parati ad servitium suum integrum nobis excludendum, et peragendum, dum, cum semper opus adhaerit, secundum quod nobis debent de feudis et tenementis suis de jure facere, et fit, ut illis statutumus per commune consilium totius regni nostri praedicti, et dedimus et concedimus in feodo jure hereditario.\" LL. Guill. c. 59.\nFeoffment end of every campaign, filled all Europe with a disorderly banditti, who frequently proved very dangerous to society. To avoid such inconveniences, standing armies were introduced, and taxation began to be raised in every European kingdom. New inconveniences arose. The sovereigns in most of these kingdoms, having acquired the right of taxation, as well as the command of the military power, became completely despotic; but in England the sovereign was deprived of this right by Magna Charta, which was extorted from him, as related under the article ENGLAND, No [153]; so that, though allowed to command his armies, he could only pay them by the voluntary contributions of the people, or their submitting to such taxations as were virtually imposed by themselves.","sp":210,"ep":217},{"h":"FEOFFMENT","t":"in Law, (from the verb feoffare or infideare, \"to give one a feud\"); the gift or grant of any corporeal hereditament to another. He that so gives, or enfeoffs, is called the feoffer, and the person enfeoffed is denominated the feoffee.\n\nThis is plainly derived from, or is indeed itself the very mode of, the ancient feudal donation; for though it may be performed by the word \"enfeoff,\" or \"grant,\" yet the aptest word of feoffment is do or dedi. And it is still directed and governed by the same feudal rules; insomuch that the principal rule relating to the extent and effect of the feudal grant, tenor eft qui legem dat feudo, is in other words become the maxim of our law with relation to feoffments, modus legem dat donationi. And therefore, as in pure feudal donations, the lord, from whom the feud moved, must expressly limit and declare the continuance or quantity of estate which he meant to confer, ne quis plus donatia praesumatur, quam in donatione expressit; so, if one grants by feoffment lands or tenements to another, and limits or expresses no estate, the grantee (due ceremonies of law being performed) hath barely an estate for life. For, as the personal abilities of the feoffee were originally presumed to be the immediate or principal inducements to the feoffment, the feoffee's estate ought to be confined to his person, and subsist only for his life; unless the feoffee, by express provision in the creation and constitution of the estate, hath given it a longer continuance. These express provisions are indeed generally made; for this was for ages the only conveyance, whereby our ancestors were wont to create an estate in fee-simple, by giving the land to the feoffee, to hold to him and his heirs for ever; though it serves equally well to convey any other estate of freehold.","sp":217,"ep":217},{"h":"FER DE FOURCHETTE","t":"in Heraldry, a cross having at each end a forked iron, like that formerly used by soldiers to rest their muskets on.

At the earliest age his extraordinary genius began to exert itself. He first learned to read by overhearing his father teach his elder brother; and he had made this acquisition before any one suspected it. He soon discovered a peculiar taste for mechanics, which first arose on seeing his father use a lever. He pursued this study a considerable length, even whilst very young; and made a watch in woodwork, from having once seen one. As he had no instructor, nor any help from books, every thing he learned had all the merit of an original discovery; and such, with infinite joy, he believed it to be. As soon as his age would permit, he went to service; in which he met with hardships, which rendered his constitution feeble through life. Whilst he was servant to a farmer (whose goodness he acknowledges in the modest and humble account of himself which he prefixed to his last publication), he frequently contemplated the stars; and began the study of astronomy, by laying down, from his own observations only, a celestial globe. His kind master, observing these marks of his ingenuity, procured him the countenance and assistance of his superiors. By their help and instructions, he went on Ferguson, gaining farther knowledge, and was sent to Edinburgh. There he began to take portraits; an employment by which he supported himself and family for several years, both in Scotland and England, whilst he was pursuing more serious studies. In London he first published some curious astronomical tables and calculations; and afterwards gave public lectures in experimental philosophy, which he repeated (by subscription) in most of the principal towns in England, with the highest marks of general approbation. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, without paying for admission (an honour scarcely ever conferred on a native); and had a pension of \u00a350 per ann. given him, unsolicited, by our gracious king, at his accession, who had heard lectures from him, and frequently lent for and conversed with him on curious topics. He also received several presents from his majesty, the patron of real merit. To what a degree of consideration Mr Ferguson mounted by the strength of his natural genius, almost every one knows. He was universally considered as at the head of astronomy and mechanics in this nation of philosophers. And he might justly be styled self-taught, or rather heaven-taught; for in his whole life he had not above half a year's instruction at school. He was a man of the clearest judgment, and the most unwearied application to study; benevolent, meek, and innocent in his manners as a child; humble, courteous, and communicative; instead of pedantry, philosophy seemed to produce in him only diffidence and urbanity,\u2014a love for mankind and for his Maker. His whole life was an example of resignation and Christian piety. He might be said to be an enthusiast in his love of God, if religion, founded on such substantial and enlightened grounds as his was, could be styled enthusiasm. He died in 1776.","sp":218,"ep":218},{"h":"FERGUSON","t":"Robert, a Scottish poet, who acquired a considerable share of celebrity at a very early period of life, was born at Edinburgh on the 5th of September 1750, of which we are assured from unquestionable authority, although some have placed it in 1751. His father's name was William, who, as well as the son, likewise paid court to the muses; but he wisely relinquished the study of poetry for the more certain emoluments of trade and commerce, being employed in different mercantile houses both in Edinburgh and Aberdeen. He was an accountant in the Linen Hall when he died, but never acquired any thing like an independent fortune.\n\nThe subject of the present sketch was of a weak and delicate constitution during infancy,\u2014indeed to such a degree, that small hopes were entertained of his ever reaching the years of manhood. Yet such were the care and attention of his parents, that he was able to attend an English school by the time he was six years of age, where his progress was considered as very extraordinary. It was no less rapid at the high school of Edinburgh, which he attended for years, acquiring a competent knowledge of the Latin tongue with very little labour or exertion. From that he went to the grammar school of Dundee, and in two years after to the university of St Andrews, which place his father preferred to Edinburgh, because a gentleman of the name of Ferguson had left two bursaries for the education of two boys of the same name.\nHis health was never impaired at any time by fever or study; yet he kept alive at the university the opinion which had been entertained of him while at school, and he was decidedly the first mathematician of the same standing. He was patronized by Dr Wilkie, professor of natural philosophy, who was perhaps as much attached to him for his poetical as his mathematical talents, the doctor himself being a poet, and author of the Epigoniad. This kindness was repaid by Ferguson, on the death of Dr Wilkie, by a beautiful elegy to his memory, written in the Scottish dialect. A little before he left the university, Ferguson had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the death of Sir William Wallace, for which he had collected materials; but as he afterwards met with a work on the same subject, he abandoned the design, after he had completed two acts. His own reason for doing so he thus expressed, \"Whatever I publish shall be original, and this tragedy might be considered as a copy.\"\n\nHe returned to Edinburgh when he had finished his studies, without having fixed on any particular employment; for although he was destined for the church by his father, on his death he paid little attention to the expectations of his mother. He declined also the study of physic, afflicting this as a reason, that when he read the description of diseases, he believed that he felt the symptoms of them all in himself. He was then induced to attempt the study of the law, in which, as was natural to expect, he made no proficiency. He seems to have turned a willing eye to some lucrative place, to obtain which he paid a visit to an uncle who resided at Aberdeen, a man of literature and opulence, hoping that through his influence he might be settled in some place suited to his merit. In this rational hope he was completely disappointed; for although his uncle shewed him every mark of attachment, his fondness decayed by degrees, and in six months he deprived him in an abrupt manner to leave his house, without attempting to procure for him any kind of living. It would perhaps be rash and uncandid to reprobate this conduct of his uncle, whose penetration probably beheld, if not the actual commission, at least the germinating seeds of those too fashionable vices and follies into which he afterwards plunged. We only give this as a conjecture of our own; but it seems to derive considerable countenance from the contrast between the manner in which his uncle received him, and the nature of their separation. Be this as it may, the conduct of his uncle operated powerfully on the mind of Ferguson, which, with the fatigue of his journey back to Edinburgh, brought on him a feverish illness, on his recovery from which he composed two elegies; one on the decay of friendship, and the other against repining at fortune; both which were suggested by this adventure at Aberdeen. The disappointment of his hopes, and the effect it produced on his mind, are very evident from the following stanzas.\n\nBut, ah! these youthful sportive hours are fled,\nThese scenes of jocund mirth are now no more;\nNo healing slumber 'tend my humble bed,\nNo friends console the sorrows of the poor.\n\nAnd what avail the thoughts of former joys?\nWhat comfort bring they in the adverse hour?\nCan they the canker-worm of care destroy,\nOr brighten fortune's discontented lour?\n\nSo great were his necessities at this period, that he copied papers in the commissary clerk's office for so much per sheet, which employment he soon left in disgust.\n\nSo boundless was his wit, which was only equalled by his good nature, modesty, and goodness of heart, that all who knew him received him with affection; but his powers of song and talents for mimicry often led him into the company of the dissipated, whose example could not fail of doing him essential injury, but who had neither the power nor inclination to provide for him through life. The irregularities into which he was thus frequently led, often awakened upon him the dictates of conscience; and the conversation of a minister who understood his manner of life, made a deep impression on his mind. In short, his remorse soon after assumed the appearance of absolute despair. His sprightliness entirely forsook him; but he gradually recovered from his delirium, and his health was fully restored. Soon after he cut his head so dreadfully in consequence of a fall, that from the loss of blood he became delirious, in which condition he remained for some months, till the want of sleep and perpetual talking put a period to his existence on the 16th of October 1774. He was buried in the Canongate churchyard; over his grave his admirer Robert Burns has since erected a monument.\n\nHad he joined prudence to his bright genius and good heart, he would have no doubt risen to distinguished eminence in the literary world. His poems in the Scottish dialect have been universally admired by his countrymen; and when we reflect that they were composed in a round of distillation, they must be considered as unequivocal evidences of his genius and taste.","sp":218,"ep":219},{"h":"FERIA","t":"in the Romish breviary, is applied to the several days of the week; thus Monday is the feria secunda, Tuesday the feria tercia; though these days are not working days, but holidays.

We have to regret that the accidental wetting of the leaf on which he wrote down his remarks has deprived the public of the knowledge of the precise degree to which the thermometer is raised by this water.

It is divided into three kinds; or rather, there are three different stages of it, viz. the vinous, the acetous, and the putrefactive. To these has been added a fourth, the panary, or the fermentation of bread. Of the first, vegetables alone are susceptible; the flesh of young animals is in some slight degree susceptible of the second (A); but animal substances are particularly susceptible of the third, which vegetables do not so easily fall into without previously undergoing the first and second. The produce of the first stage is wine, or some other vinous liquor; of the second, vinegar; and of the third, ammonia or volatile alkali.\n\n(A) Under the article CHINA, No. 115, a fact is mentioned which seems to show that animal substances are likewise capable of the vinous fermentation; viz. that the Chinese make use of a certain liquor called lamb wine, and likewise that they use a kind of spirit distilled from sheep's flesh. This is related on the credit of M. Gro\u00dfer; but as he does not mention the particulars of the process, we are at liberty to suppose that the flesh of these animals has been mixed with rice, or some other ingredients naturally capable of producing a vinous liquor; so that, instead of contributing any thing to the fermentation in question, they may in reality be detrimental, and furnish only that strong and disagreeable smell complained of in the liquid.\nkali.

Being sent to Paris to study rhetoric and philosophy, he applied himself in a most intense manner. All other pleasure was insipid to him. He cared neither for play nor for walking, nor for entertainments, nor even for conversation. He read Cicero, Plato, and Aristotle. The reading of Cicero procured him this advantage, that the lectures he read on philosophical subjects were as eloquent as those of the other masters were barbarous at that time. He also applied himself very earnestly to the mathematics. This continual study drew upon him a long fit of sickness, which obliged him to leave Paris. On his recovery, he returned thither with a design to study physic; but before he applied himself entirely to it, he taught philosophy in the college of St Barbara. After this he spent four years in the study of physic; and taking a doctor's degree, confined himself to his closet, in order to read the best authors, and to improve himself in the mathematics; that is, as far as the business of his profession would suffer him. Never was a man more diligent than Fernel. He used to rise at four o'clock in the morning, and studied till it was time either to read lectures or to visit patients. He then examined the urine that was brought him; for this was the method of those times, with regard to the poor people, who did not send for the physician. Coming home to dine, he shut himself up among his books till they called him down to table. Rising from table, he returned to his study, which he did not leave without necessary occasions. Coming home at night, he did just as at noon: he sat among his books till they called him to supper; returned to them the moment he had supped; and did not leave them till eleven o'clock, when he went to bed. In the course of these studies, he contrived mathematical instruments, and was at great charges in making them. But his wife murmuring at the expense, he dismissed his instrument-makers, and applied himself in good earnest to practice physic. But as visiting patients did not employ his whole time, he read public lectures upon Hippocrates and Galen. This soon gained him a great reputation through France and in foreign countries. His business increasing, he left off reading lectures; but as nothing could make him cease to study in private, he spent all the hours he could spare in composing a work of physic, entitled Physiologia, which was soon after published. He was prevailed with to read lectures upon this new work, which he did for three years; and undertaking another work, which he published, De venae sectione, he laid himself under the necessity of reading lectures some years longer, in order to explain this new book to the youth. While he was thus employed, he was sent for to court, in order to try whether he could cure a lady, whose recovery was despaired of. He was so happy as to cure her; which was the first cause of that esteem which Henry II. who was then but dauphin, and was in love with that lady, conceived for him. This prince offered him, even then, the place of first physician to him; but Fernel, who infinitely preferred his studies to the hurry of a court, would not accept the employment. When Henry came to the throne, he renewed his entreaties; but Fernel represented that the honour which was offered to him was due, for several reasons, and as an hereditary right, to the late king's physician; and that, as for himself, he wanted some time to make experiments concerning several discoveries he had made relating to physic. The king admitted this; but as soon as Francis I.'s physician died, Fernel was obliged to go and fill his place at Henry II.'s court. And here just the contrary to what he dreaded came to pass; for he enjoyed more rest and more leisure at court than he had done at Paris; and he might have considered the court as an agreeable retirement, had it not been for the journeys which the new civil war obliged the king to take. He died in 1558, leaving behind him a great many works, besides what have been mentioned; as, De abditiis rerum causis, seven books of Pathology, a book on Remedies, &c. They have been printed several times; with his life prefixed, written by William Plantinus his disciple.","sp":221,"ep":221},{"h":"FERO","t":"Faro, or Feroe Islands; a cluster of little islands lying in the Northern ocean, between 61\u00b0 15' and 62\u00b0 21' N. Lat. and between 5\u00b0 and 8\u00b0 W. Long. They belong to Denmark. There are 17 which are habitable; each of which is a lofty mountain rising out of the waves, divided from the others by deep and rapid currents. Some of them are deeply indented with secure harbours; Providence seeming to have favoured mankind with the safest retreats in the most boisterous seas. All are very steep, and most of them faced with most tremendous precipices. The surface of the mountains consists of a shallow soil of remarkable fertility; for barley, the only corn grown here, yields above 20 for one; and the grass affords abundant pastureage for sheep. The exports are, salted mutton and tallow, goose quills, feathers, and eider down; and,\nby the industry of the inhabitants, knit woollen waistcoats, caps, and stockings. No trees beyond the size of juniper or fluted willows will grow here; nor are any wild quadrupeds to be met with except rats and mice, originally escaped from the shipping. Vast quantities of sea fowl frequent the rocks; and the taking of them furnishes a very perilous employment to the natives, as described under the article Bird-Catching.\n\nThe sea which surrounds these islands is extremely turbulent. The tides vary greatly on the western and eastern sides. On the first, where is received the uninterrupted flood of the ocean from the remote Greenland, the tide rises seven fathoms; on the eastern side it rises only three. Dreadful whirlwinds, called by the Danes oes, agitate the sea to a strange degree; catch up a vast quantity of water, so as to leave a great temporary chasm in the spot on which it falls, and carries away with it, to an amazing distance, any fishes which may happen to be within reach of its fury. Thus great shoals of herrings have been found on the highest mountains of Feroe. It is equally irresistible on land; tearing up trees, stones, and animals, and carrying them to very distant places.\n\nAmong the numerous whirlpools of these seas, that of Suderoe, near the island of the same name, is the most noted. It is occasioned by a crater 61 fathoms in depth in the centre, and from 50 to 55 on the sides. The water forms four fierce circumferences. The point they begin at is on the side of a large basin, where commences a range of rocks running spirally, and terminating at the verge of the crater. This range is extremely rugged, and covered with water from the depth of 12 to 8 fathoms only. It forms four equidistant wreaths with a channel from 35 to 20 fathoms in depth between each. On the outside, beyond that depth, the sea suddenly sinks to 80 and 90. On the south border of the basin is a lofty rock, called Sumbroe Munk, noted for the multitude of birds which frequent it. On one side, the water is only 3 or 4 fathoms deep; on the other 15. The danger at most times, especially in storms, is very great. Ships are irresistibly drawn in; the rudder loses its power; and the waves beat as high as the masts; so that an escape is almost miraculous; yet at the reflux, and in very still weather, the inhabitants will venture in boats for the sake of fishing.\n\nInnumerable flocks of aquatic birds are continually to be seen perched on the extremities of the rocks, which make their nests in the clefts above the precipices; and vast numbers of them may be killed by the discharge of a single musket, and the rest will not stir, so little are they accustomed to be disturbed. One of the islands contains but a single habitation, which can be visited by the curate only in summer. In the southern part of these islands coal-mines were discovered about the beginning of the eighteenth century, and trials of the coals were only made in 1777, when it was judged that working them would be of sufficient interest and consequence. The quarry was determined by a commissary to be about 12,000 feet long, 4000 broad on a medium, and five feet deep; but to great did the difficulty of working it appear, that the idea was abandoned. The coals were analyzed by the celebrated professor Kratzenstein of Copenhagen, who found that they were superior to those of England, as burning longer, and giving a more intense heat, but not so easily kindled. A trial of them has been made in Scotland, and they are allowed to be of a superior quality. It is a favourable circumstance to the exportation of the produce of these islands, that their harbours are never frozen, and navigation of consequence could meet with no interruption during the winter.\n\nThe measles and smallpox never attack the inhabitants but when they are brought there by strangers, when the ravages they make are almost as terrible as those of the pestilence; but for 70 years back they have not been subjected to this dreadful visitation. The air is temperate, and neither too hot in summer, nor extremely cold in winter. There are frequent mists on these islands, but they do not seem to be injurious to the health of the inhabitants. The wind often blows with such violence, that the people on horseback are obliged to dismount at its approach, which is announced by a whistling across the rocks; and persons on foot must throw themselves flat on their face, to avoid the dreadful consequences of the irresistible hurricane. So sudden is its approach at some times, that a burning candle might be carried in the open air but a few seconds before it. There is seldom any thunder on these islands; but when the phenomenon does happen, its awful and incessant roar among the rocks is truly alarming. Potatoes, the cultivation of which is rapidly advancing, thrive well, and the same is the case with radishes and turnips. Corn is not much cultivated, which would require excessive labour in a country so mountainous, and the spring fishery requires all the hands that can be spared. Trees cannot be made to grow upon them, and of consequence there is no wood.\n\nThe number of inhabitants does not exceed 5000; and they are in general well made, with fair complexions, and their whiteness is very seldom impaired by the influence of the sun. They are not deficient in understanding; and although phlegmatic, yet they are benevolent and hospitable, and are seldom known to quarrel. They are fond of brandy, and yet it is said that they are very rarely seen in a state of intoxication. They are frugal and upright, yet extremely credulous, and much addicted to superstitious practices. There are no schools among them, as parents educate their own children, and their knowledge of consequence is very circumscripted. They abound in skilful players at chess, but are wholly unacquainted with instruments of music, and dance to the sound of the voice.","sp":222,"ep":223},{"h":"FERONIA","t":"the Pagan goddess of woods and orchards.

In the same reign, the young king being then at Greenwich, Mr Ferrars was proclaimed lord of misrule, that is, prince of sports and pastimes; which office he discharged during 12 days, in Christmas holidays, to the entire satisfaction of the court. This is all we know of Mr Ferrars; except that he died in 1579, at Flamstead in Hertfordshire, and was buried in the parish church. He is not less celebrated for his valour in the field, than for his other accomplishments as a gentleman and a scholar. He wrote, 1. History of the Reign of Queen Mary; published in Grafton's chronicle, 1569, fol. 2.

Make a number of stratifications of plates of copper and white vitriol alternately in a crucible; which place on the floor of the glass furnace near the eye; and let it stand there three days; then take it out, and make a new stratification with more fresh vitriol; calcine again as before.

It is described as a very large place, surrounded with high walls, within which there are hills and valleys, only the middle being level and flat. The river, which runs through the city, is divided into two streams, from which canals are cut into every part of the town; so that the mosques, colleges, palaces, and the houses of great men, are amply supplied with water. They have generally square marble basins in the middle of the court of their houses, which are supplied with water by marble pipes that pass through the walls. They constantly run over, and the stream returns back into the street, and so into the river. The houses are built with brick or stone; and are adorned on the outside with fine mosaic work, or tiles like those of Holland. The wood work and ceilings are carved, painted and gilt. The roofs are flat; for they sleep on the tops of the houses in summer. Most of the houses\nhouses are two stories high, and some three. There are plazas and galleries running all round the court on the inside, so that you may wander cover from one apartment to another. The pillars are of brick, covered with glazed tiles, or of marble, with arches between. The timber work is carved and painted with gay colours, and most of the rooms have marble cisterns of water. Some of the great men build towers over their houses several stories high, and spare no expense to render them beautiful; from hence they have a fine prospect all over the city.\n\nThere are in this city 700 mosques, great and small; 50 of which are magnificent, and supported with marble pillars, and other ornaments. The floors are covered with mats, as well as the walls to the height of a man. Every mosque has a tower or minaret, like those in Turkey, with a gallery on the top, from whence they call the people to prayers. The principal mosque is near a mile and a half in circumference. The middle building is 150 yards in length, and 80 in breadth, with a tower proportionally high. Round this to the east, west, and north, there are great colonnades 30 or 40 yards long. There are 900 lamps lighted every night; and in the middle of the mosque are large branches, which are capable of holding 500 lamps each. Along the walls are seven pulpits, from which the doctors of the law teach the people. The business of the priest is only to read prayers, and distribute alms to the people; to support which, there are large revenues.\n\nBesides the mosques, there are two colleges built in the Moorish manner, and adorned with marble and paintings. In one of them there are 100 rooms, besides a magnificent hall. In this there is a great marble vase full of water, adorned with marble pillars of various colours, and finely polished. The capitals are gilt, and the roof shines with gold, azure, and purple. The walls are adorned with Arabic verses in gold characters. The other colleges are not near so beautiful, or rather are all gone to ruin since the neglect of learning.\n\nThere are hospitals in the city, where formerly all strangers were maintained three days gratis. But the estates belonging to them have been confiscated for the emperor's use. There are above 100 public baths, many of which are stately buildings. People of the same trade or business live in streets by themselves.\n\nThough the country about Fez is pleasant and fertile, and in many places abounding with corn and cattle, yet a great part of it lies waste and uncultivated, not so much for want of inhabitants as from the oppression of the governors; which makes the people choose to live at some distance from the high roads, where they cultivate just as much land as is necessary for their own subsistence.\n\nRound the city there are fine marble tombs, monuments, and gardens full of all manner of fruit trees.\n\nSuch are the common accounts of this city. The following are given by M. Chenier, in his Recherches Historiques sur les Maures.\n\nFez was built in the end of the eighth century by Edris, a descendant of Mahomet and of Ali; whose father, in order to avoid the proclivities of the caliph Abdallah, retired to the extremity of Africa, and was proclaimed sovereign by the Moors. Sidy Edris, having succeeded to the throne of his father, built the city of Fez in the year 793. He caused a mosque to be erected, in which his body was interred, and the city ever afterwards became an asylum for the Moors, and a place of devotion. In the first moments of fervour which a new worship inspires, another mosque was built called caroub, which is perhaps one of the largest and most beautiful edifices in Africa. Several others were successively built, besides colleges and hospitals; and the city was held in such veneration, that when the pilgrimage to Mecca was interrupted in the fourth century of the Hegira, the western Mahometans substituted that of Fez in its stead, while the eastern people went to Jerusalem.\n\nWhen the Arabs had spread Asia, Africa, and Europe, they brought to Fez the little knowledge they had acquired in the sciences and arts; and that capital conjoined, with the schools of religion, academies where philosophy was taught, together with medicine and astronomy. This last gradually degenerated; ignorance brought astrology into repute, and this quickly engendered the arts of magic and divination.\n\nFez soon became the common resort of all Africa. The Mahometans went thither for the purposes of devotion; the affluence of strangers introduced a taste for pleasure; libertinism quickly followed; and, as its progress is most rapid in warm countries, Fez, which had been the nurse of sciences and arts, became a harbour for every kind of vice. The public baths, which health, cleanliness, and custom, had rendered necessary, and which were everywhere respected as sacred places, became scenes of debauchery; where men introduced themselves in the habits of women; youths in the same disguise, with a dittoff in their hands, walked the streets at sunset in order to entice strangers to their inns, which were less a place of repose than a convenience for prostitution.\n\nThe usurpers who disputed the kingdom of Fez after the 16th century overlooked these abuses, and contented themselves with subjecting the masters of the inns to furnish a certain number of cooks for the army. It is to this laxity of discipline that Fez owed its first splendour. As the inhabitants are beautiful, the Africans flocked thither in crowds; the laws were overturned, morals despised, and vice itself turned into an engine of political resource. The same spirit, the same inclinations, the same depravity, still exist in the hearts of all the Moors. But libertinism is not now encouraged; it wears there, as in other places, the mask of hypocrisy; and dares not venture to show itself in the face of day.\n\nThe Mahometans of Andalusia, those of Granada and Cordova, migrated to Fez during the different revolutions that agitated Spain: they carried with them new customs and new arts, and perhaps some slight degree of civilization. The Spanish Moors carried from Cordova to Fez the art of staining goat and sheep skins with a red colour, which were then called Cordova leather, and now Morocco leather, from that city where the art is less perfect. They manufacture gauzes at Fez, silk stuffs, and girdles elegantly embroidered with gold and silk, which show how far their ingenuity might be carried if industry were more encouraged.\n\nThere is still some taste for study preserved at Fez, and the Arabic language is spoken there in greater purity.\npurity than in any other part of the empire. The rich Moors send their children to the schools at Fez, where they are better instructed than they could be elsewhere.\n\nLeo Africanus, in the 16th century, gave a magnificent description of this city, from which most of those that have been afterwards made are copied; but its situation, its schools, and the industry and great urbanity of its inhabitants, are the only circumstances that give it any preference to the other cities of the empire. There are some pretty convenient inns here, consisting of two or three stories. The houses have no elegance externally: the streets are ill paved, and so strait that two persons riding abreast can hardly pass. The shops are like stalls; and have no more room in them than is sufficient to serve for the owner, who is always seated with his wares around him, which he shows to the passengers. But though the Moors of Fez are more civilized than the rest, they are vain, superstitious, and intolerant; and an order must be obtained from the emperor before a Christian or a Jew can be allowed to enter the city.\n\nThe situation of Fez is exceedingly singular. It lies in the bottom of a valley surrounded by little hills in the shape of a funnel; the declivities are divided into gardens planted with tall trees, orange shrubs, and all sorts of fruit trees; a river meanders along the declivity, and turns a number of mills, which distribute the water abundantly to all the gardens, and almost to every house. The descent to the city, which stands in the centre, is long; and the road lies through these gardens, which it traverses, in a serpentine direction.\n\nThe gardens, seen from the city, form a most delightful amphitheatre. Formerly each garden had a house in which the inhabitants spent the summer. These houses were destroyed in the times of the civil wars, and in the revolutions to which Fez has been subject, and few individuals have restored them. The situation of Fez, however, cannot be healthful; moist vapours fill the air in summer, and fevers are exceedingly common.\n\nOn the height above Fez, in a plain susceptible of rich cultivation, stands New Fez, finely situated, and enjoying excellent air, containing some old palaces, in which the children of the emperor live, and where he sometimes resides himself. New Fez is inhabited by some Moorish families, but by a greater number of Jews.\n\nFez is seated on the river Cebu, W. Long. 4\u00b0 25'. N.

It is bounded on the east by the Harutich and line of the deserts; by the country of the Tibboes on the south and south-east; by that of the Nomadic Tuaregs on the south-west; and the country which forms the western boundary, is inhabited by Arabs. It contains 101 towns and villages, of which Mourzouk is the metropolis. The climate of this kingdom is neither temperate nor agreeable at any season whatever; for the heat of summer is almost intolerable, even to the inhabitants, especially when the wind blows from the south; and the prevalence of the north wind during winter makes the cold so intense, as not only to chill the natives, but those also who visit it from northern Fezzan regions.\n\nRain falls but seldom in this country, and in very small quantities. Thunder is also a rare phenomenon: Mr Horneman affirms us that there was not a single storm from November 1798 to June 1799; and that on the last day of January 1799 there were some faint flashes of lightning unaccompanied by any claps of thunder. Winds, however, blow very frequently, both from the north and south, whirling up the dust and sand in such a manner as to give the atmosphere a yellowish appearance. There is neither river nor rivulet of any consequence in the whole country, according to Mr Horneman, who informs us that the soil is a deep sand, beneath which is found calcareous rock or earth, and sometimes a stratum of an argillaceous subfusance.\n\nDate trees may be considered as the natural production of Fezzan, in the western parts of which some fenana grows, of a superior quality to that which is imported from the country of the Tibboes. Culinary plants, and almost every vegetable peculiar to the garden, are met with in abundance. Wheat and barley seem well adapted to the nature of the soil, as well as to the climate; yet corn is not raised in sufficient quantity for home consumption, which is brought from those parts of Africa bordering on the northern parts of the kingdom. This is most probably owing to the native indolence of the people, the despotism of their government, and the difficulties inseparable from their peculiar mode of tillage.\n\nThey bestow little attention on the rearing of cattle, which are only found in the most fertile parts of the country, and even in these their numbers are but small. They are made use of to draw water from the wells, and are never killed but in cases of absolute necessity. The common domestic animal is the goat; and although sheep are reared in the southern parts of the country, the most abundant supply is furnished by the Arabs on the borders. They make coarse cloths of the wool, which constitute the apparel of the inhabitants in general. Their horses are not numerous, as they make most use of asses, either for carriage, draught, or burthen. Camels bear a most extravagant price, being only made use of by the higher ranks, or by opulent merchants; and the common food of all those animals is the fruit of the date tree.\n\nAlthough the trade of Fezzan consists entirely of foreign articles, it is nevertheless considerable. Mourzouk is the great market and place of general resort for different caravans from Cairo, Bengasi, Tripoli, and other places, between the months of October and February. The caravans which come to Mourzouk from the west or south, deal in ostrich feathers, tiger skins, gold dust, and also in furs of both sexes as articles of commerce. Tobacco and snuff, with other articles manufactured in Turkey, are brought to the capital by the merchants from Bengasi; and paper, fire-arms, sabres, knives, and woollen cloth, are conveyed to it from Tripoli.\n\nFezzan is governed by a sultan, a descendant of the family of the Sheriffs; and according to the tradition of the country, his ancestors came from the western parts of Africa, invaded and made a conquest of it about 500 years ago. He reigns over his dominions with ab-\nFezzan. Solute power, but is at the same time tributary to the bailhaw of Tripoli, who annually receives from him the sum of 4000 dollars by the hands of an officer appointed for that purpose. The sultan who was upon the throne when Mr Horne man in 1798 visited the country, assumed the title of \"Sultan Muhammed ben Sultan Manfur,\" engraved on a seal which is applied to all public acts, and also to correspondence within his dominions; but he makes use of a smaller seal when he writes to the bailhaw of Tripoli. The crown is hereditary; yet it descends not in all cases from father to son, for when the heir apparent dies, a nephew may succeed in preference to a second son, which is frequently the occasion of much bloodshed, when the right of succession comes to be warmly contested. The palace of the sultan is within the walls of the fortress of the capital, where he leads a life of retirement attended by his eunuchs. The harem is near the palace, into which he never enters, as the female whom he inclines to see is conducted to his apartment. The harem consists of the sultana and about 40 female slaves, which last he frequently dispenses of, and replaces them by others, unless they bear him children, or become the objects of his ardent attachment, either by their personal beauty or other accomplishments.\n\nThose who wish for an audience with the sultan, approach the throne, which is an old elbow chair raised a few steps from the ground, kiss his hand, and raise it so as to touch their forehead, and then kneel before him to give a statement of their business in common language, taking care, however, to intermix it with such exclamations as these: \"God prolong thy life, God protect thy country,\" and to offer him some small present. The court of the sultan consists of a first and second minister, the general of his forces, a number of black, and a few white slaves. Some of the black slaves who are purchased while boys, and educated according to their distinctions and talents, often acquire considerable influence with the sultan.\n\nThe dress of the sultan, when he appears in state, consists of a white frock of stuff, ornamented with gold and silver, and sometimes of satin interwoven with silver. The appearance of his turban is remarkable, which measures not less than three feet from the fore to the hinder part, and two feet in breadth. His revenue arises from certain taxes on all gardens and cultivated lands, and from fines and requisitions imposed in an arbitrary manner. The slaves who are employed in collecting these are often rigorous in the extreme, but it is often possible to procure their lenity by means of a bribe. The expenditure of this revenue is chiefly confined to the support of the sultan, his court and palace, for the cadi and department of justice; the religious order, and principal officers of government, are supported by the produce of date-tree woods and gardens.\n\nThe administration of justice is vested in the hands of a cadi, whose decisions are guided by the Mohammedan law, by antiquated customs, and established practice; but judgment in all criminal cases is purely arbitrary, or is referred to the sultan. The office of cadi has been hereditary in one family, ever since the conquest of the country by the ancestors of the present sultan; and when he dies, his place is filled up by one who is most eminent for learning, or who can best read and write, which is all the learning that he is ever possessed of.\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain anything like an accurate statement of the population of Fezzan, but Mr Horne man conjectures that they may amount to about 75,000, all of them professing the religion of Mahomet. The complexion of the people varies considerably; those in the northern parts bearing in this respect a striking resemblance to the Arabians, while those in the southern districts are very much like the Tibboes and Tuaregs. Those who are strictly indigenous are of ordinary stature, and their limbs far from being muscular; of a deep brown colour, short black hair, with their face formed like the people of Europe, and their nose not so flat as that of the negro. Their walk, mein and gesture, indicate a total want of energy, either of body or mind.\n\nThe women of this country are in general fond of dancing, and the wanton manners and public freedoms in which they are permitted to indulge, are frequently astonishing, even to Mahometans from other countries; and the men are very much addicted to the vice of drunkenness, using the juice of the date-tree, or a drink that is called baya, which is of an intoxicating nature.\n\nDifferent species of the venereal disease prevail in this country, but that which is brought from Soudan is reckoned the most virulent. The common lues venerea is called franzi, for the cure of which they make use of salts and colocynth as powerful cathartics, healing the sores with natron water or dissolved soda. They are sometimes afflicted with hemorrhoids, the cure of which is no doubt rendered more difficult by the too liberal use of red pepper; and a fever and ague which are very pernicious to foreigners. They are entirely unacquainted with phlebotomy, yet they sometimes draw blood by means of cupping; and some are as much acquainted with surgery as to be able to cure a simple fracture.\n\nTheir houses are miserable structures, composed of stones or bricks mixed with clay, and dried in the sun, and the hands of the labourer are all the tools which are employed in building. When the walls are finished, they are covered over with mortar made of calcareous earth, which is also done with the hand. Their houses are extremely low, and there is no other entrance for the light but by the door. They are uncommonly abstemious in respect of diet. Indeed they can never abstain from butcher meat when it is placed before them; but this is not an article of food with the generality, and their expression for a rich man is, \"that he eats bread and meat every day.\"\n\nFEWEL.

They were of various forms, and often adorned with precious stones. Men and women wore them in their hair and at their shoes. Players and musicians, by way of preserving the voices of children put under their care to learn their arts, used to keep clothe the prepuce with a fibula, lest they should have commerce with women.\n\nFicinus, Marsilius, a celebrated Italian, was born at Florence in 1433, and educated at the expense of Laurence de Medicis. He attained a perfect knowledge of the Greek and Latin tongues, and became a great philosopher, a great physician, and a great divine. He was in the highest favour with Laurence and Cosmo de Medicis, who made him a canon of the cathedral church of Florence. He applied himself intensely to the study of philosophy; and while others were striving who should be the deepest read in Aristotle, who was then the philosopher in fashion, he devoted himself wholly to Plato. He was indeed the first who restored the Platonic philosophy in the west; for the better effecting of which he translated into Latin the whole works of Plato. There goes a story, but we know not how true it is, that when he had finished his translation, he communicated it to his friend Marcus Maturus, to have his approbation of it; but that, Maturus disliking it, he did it all over again. He next translated Plotinus; and afterwards the works, or part of them at least, of Proclus, Jamblicus, Porphyrius, and other celebrated Platonists.\u2014In his younger years, Ficinus lived like a philosopher; and too much so, as is said, to the neglect of piety. However, Savonarola coming to Florence, Ficinus went with every body else to hear his sermons; and while he attended them for the sake of the preacher's eloquence, he imbibed a strong sense of religion, and devoted himself henceforward more especially to the duties of it. He died at Correggio in 1499; and as Baronius assures us upon the testimony of what he calls credible authors, appeared immediately after his death to his friend Michael Mercatus: to whom, it seems, he had promised to appear, in order to confirm what he had taught concerning the immortality of the soul. His writings, sacred and profane, which are very numerous, were collected and printed at Venice in 1516, at Basil in 1561 and 1576, and at Paris 1641, in two vols. folio. Twelve books of his Epistles, among which are many treatises, were printed separately in folio at Venice 1495, and at Nuremberg 1497, in folio 4to.\n\nFicoideae, the specific name given to several plants, as the mefembryanthemum, mufa, and opuntia.

See Botany Index.\n\nThe ficus religiosa, or Banian tree, is a native of several parts of the East Indies. It has a woody stem, branching to a great height and vast extent, with heart-shaped entire leaves ending in acute points. Of this tree the following lines of Milton contain a description equally beautiful and just:\n\nThere soon they chose\nThe fig tree; not that tree for fruit renown'd,\nBut such as, at this day to Indians known\nIn Malabar or Decan, spreads her arms,\nBranching so broad and long, that in the ground\nThe bended twigs take root, and daughters grow\nAbout the mother tree, a pillar'd shade,\nHigh overarch'd, and echoing walks between:\nThere oft' the Indian herdman, thumping heart,\nShelters in cool, and tends his pasturing herds\nAt loop-holes cut through thickest shade.\n\nPar. Lost, Book ix. l. 1100.\n\nThe Banian tree, or Indian fig, is perhaps the most beautiful of Nature's productions in that genial climate, where she sports with the greatest profusion and variety. Some of these trees are of amazing size and great extent, as they are continually increasing, and, contrary to most other things in animal and vegetable life, they seem to be exempted from decay. Every branch from the main body throws out its own roots; at first, in small tender fibres, several yards from the ground; these continually grow thicker until they reach the surface; and there striking in, they increase to large trunks, and become parent trees, shooting out new branches from the top; these in time suspend their roots, which, swelling into trunks, produce other branches; thus continuing in a state of progression as long as the earth, the first parent of them all, contributes her sustenance. The Hindoos are particularly fond of the Banian tree; they look upon it as an emblem of the Deity, from its long duration, its outstretching arms, and overshadowing beneficence; they almost pay it divine honours, and\n\nFind a fane in every sacred grove.\n\nNear these trees the most esteemed pagodas are generally erected; under their shade the Brahmins spend their lives in religious solitude; and the natives of all castes and tribes are fond of reclining in the cool recesses, beautiful walks, and lovely vistas of this unbraggious canopy, impervious to the hottest beams of a tropical sun.\n\nA remarkable large tree of this kind grows on an island in the river Nerbudda, ten miles from the city of Baroche in the province of Guzerat; a flourishing settlement lately in possession of the East India Company, but ceded by the government of Bengal, at the treaty of peace concluded with the Mahattas in 1783,\nto Mahadajee Scindia a Mahratta chief. It is distinguished by the name of Cubbeer Burr, which was given it in honour of a famous saint. It was once much larger than at present; but high floods have carried away the banks of the island where it grows, and with them such parts of the tree as had thus far extended their roots: yet what remains is about 2000 feet in circumference, measured round the principal stems; the overhanging branches, not yet struck down, cover a much larger space. The chief trunks of this single tree (which in size greatly exceed our English elms and oaks), amount to 350; the smaller stems, forming into stronger supporters, are more than 3000; and every one of these is calling out new branches, and hanging roots, in time to form trunks, and become the parents of a future progeny. Cubbeer Burr is famed throughout Hindostan for its great extent and surpassing beauty: the Indian armies generally encamp around it; and, at stated seasons, solemn jatarras, or Hindu festivals, are held there, to which thousands of votaries repair from various parts of the Mogul empire.\u2014It is said that 7000 persons find ample room to repose under its shade. The English gentlemen, on their hunting and shooting parties, used to form extensive encampments, and spend weeks together under this delightful pavilion, which is generally filled with green wood pigeons, doves, peacocks, and a variety of feathered songsters; crowded with families of monkeys performing their antics tricks; and shaded by bays of a large size, many of them measuring upwards of six feet from the extremity of one wing to the other. This tree not only affords shelter, but sustenance, to all its inhabitants, being covered amid its bright foliage with small figs of a rich scarlet, on which they all regale with as much delight, as the lords of creation on their more costly fare in their parties.","sp":228,"ep":230},{"h":"FIDDES","t":"RICHARD, a learned divine and polite writer, was born in 1671, and educated at Oxford.

He had four sisters; of whom Sarah is well known, as writer of The Adventures of David Simple. On the death of his mother, his father married again; and Sir John Fielding, who succeeded him in the commission of the peace for Middlesex, is his brother by this marriage. Henry was sent to study at Leyden; but a failure in his remittances obliged him to return in two years, when his own propensity to gaiety and profusion drove him to write for the stage at 20 years of age. His first dramatic piece, Love in several Masques, which was well received, appeared in 1727; and all his plays and farces, to the amount of 18, were written before\nbefore the year 1737, and many of them are still acted with applause. While he was thus employed, he married a young lady with \u00a3500 fortune, and inherited an estate of \u00a3200 a-year from his mother; all which, though on the plan of retiring into the country, he contrived to dispense in three years; and then applied himself to the study of the law for a maintenance. In losing his fortune, he acquired the gout; which, rendering it impossible for him to attend the bar, he with a shattered constitution had recourse to many extempore applications of his pen for immediate supplies; until, soon after the rebellion in 1745, he accepted the office of acting justice for Middlesex, an employment much more profitable than honourable in the public esteem. Reduced at length by the fatigues of this office, and by a complication of disorders, he, by the advice of his physicians, went to Lisbon, where he died in 1754.

It extends about 60 miles in length from Culross to Fifeness, and is about 18 in breadth; comprehending a superficies of nearly 480 square miles. The face of the country is agreeably diversified; towards the west it is mountainous, and a ridge of hills extends eastward almost its whole length, occupying the central district; towards the north and south the surface gradually descends to the friths, exhibiting the most beautiful and enlivening prospect of fertile and well cultivated fields. It is watered by several streams, none of which deserve the name of rivers, except the Eden and Leven; the former empties itself into the ocean at St. Andrews, and the latter at the village of Leven: both these rivers abound with trout and salmon; and on no coast of Scotland is the white fishing more productive than on the Fife coast. From its situation, it appears to have been very early inhabited; the fisheries, coal mines, harbours, and other advantages for navigation, attracted settlers, and the coast was first peopled and best cultivated: this appears to have been the case, when King James VI compared Fifeshire the county to a gray mantle with a gold fringe. The whole coast is covered with small burghs, which that monarch regarded with particular attention, and very early in his reign endeavoured to render them subservient to his wishes, of raising Scotland high in the world as a commercial nation; he granted them many privileges and immunities, and encouraged the inhabitants by every means in his power, to prosecute the advantages which, by their local situation, they possessed; indeed, the municipal privileges which they received from that monarch, though rendered unimportant by the union with England, will long remain a monument of his political sagacity and discernment. The county can boast of possessing several ancient seats of royalty: at Dunfermline, at Falkland, at Kinghorn, and at St Andrews, vestiges of royal splendour are still to be seen. It contains 13 royal boroughs, which possess parliamentary representation, and several which have lost that privilege from their being unable to defray the expense which attended the sending a commissioner to the Scottish parliament. To the county also belongs the small island of May, on which there is a lighthouse, and Inchgarvie. Fifeshire is divided into 60 parishes, and contains, by the enumeration in 1801, 93,743 inhabitants, being nearly 196 to the square mile; a much greater proportion than is to be found in any other county in Scotland. It was anciently an earldom in the Macduff family, created by Malcolm III. for the services performed by the thane of Fife, in restoring him to the throne of Scotland, when usurped by Macbeth. That title having expired, it was lately revived in the Duffs of Braco, lateral descendents of the ancient family: the ruins of the residences of that powerful nobleman are still evident in many parts of the county. The whole of the south side lies upon coal, and many pits are wrought on every part of the coast; in many places is excellent limestone; and some marl is found in the county. Ironstone, of excellent quality, is found in the western and middle quarters, and much is forged in the county, or exported to the Carron works. Lead ore is found in the Eastern Lomond, one of the two conical hills which rise nearly in the middle of the county, and are seen at a great distance: in Kemback parish also lead ore has been wrought.

See Painting.\n\nFigure, in the manufactures, is applied to the various designs represented or wrought on velvets, damasks, taffettes, satins, and other stuffs and cloths.\n\nThe most usual figures for such designs are flowers imitated from the life; or grotesques, and compartments of pure fancy. Representations of men, beasts, birds, and landscapes, have only been introduced since the taste for the Chinese stuffs, particularly those called Sureer, began to prevail among us. It is the woof of the stuff that forms the figures; the warp only serves for the ground. In working figured stuffs there is required a person to show the workman how far he must raise the threads of the warp, to represent the figure of the design with the woof, which is to be passed across between the threads thus raised. This former call reading the design.\n\nFor the figures on tapestry, brocade, &c. see Tapestry, &c.\n\nFor those given by the calendars, printers, &c. see Calendar, &c.\n\nFigure, in Logic, denotes a certain order and disposition of the middle term in any syllogism.\n\nFigures are fourfold. 1. When the middle term is the subject of the major proposition, and the predicate of the minor, we have what is called the first figure. 2. When the middle term is the predicate of both the premises, the syllogism is said to be in the second figure. 3. If the middle term is the subject of the two premises, the syllogism is in the third figure: and lastly, by making it the predicate of the major, and subject of the minor, we obtain syllogisms in the fourth figure. Each of these figures has a determinate number of moods, including all the possible ways in which propositions differing in quantity or quality can be combined, according to any disposition of the middle term, in order to arrive at a just conclusion. See Logic.\n\nFigure, in composition. See Oratory; also Allegory, Apostrophe, Hyperbole, Metaphor, Personification, &c.\n\nA Figure, the means or instrument conceived to be the agent. When we survey a number of connected objects, that which makes the greatest figure employs chiefly our attention; and the emotion it raises, if lively, prompts us even to exceed nature in the conceptions we form of it. Take the following examples.\nFor Neleus' Ion Alcides' rage had slain.\nA broken rock the force of Pirus threw.\n\nIn these instances, the rage of Hercules and the force of Pirus, being the capital circumstances, are so far exalted as to be conceived the agents that produce the effects.\n\nIn the first of the following instances, hunger being the chief circumstance in the description, is itself imagined to be the patient.\n\nWhose hunger has not tasted food these three days.\n\nAs when the force\nOf subterranean wind transports a hill.\n\nParadise Lost.\n\nAs when the potent rod\nOf Amram's son, in Egypt's evil day,\nWav'd round the coast, upcall'd a pitchy cloud\nOf locusts.\n\nParadise Lost.\n\nA Figure, which, among related objects, extends the properties of one to another. This figure is not dignified with a proper name, because it has been overlooked by writers. Giddy brink, jovial wine, daring wound, are examples of this figure. Here are adjectives that cannot be made to signify any quality of the substantives to which they are joined: a brink, for example, cannot be termed giddy in a sentence, either proper or figurative, that can signify any of its qualities or attributes.\n\nWhen we examine attentively the expression, we discover, that a brink is termed giddy from producing that effect in those who stand on it; in the same manner, a wound is said to be daring, not with respect to itself, but with respect to the boldness of the person who inflicts it: and wine is said to be jovial, as inspiring mirth and jollity. Thus the attributes of one subject are extended to another with which it is connected; and the expression of such a thought must be considered as a figure, because the attribute is not applicable to the subject in any proper sense.\n\nHow are we to account for this figure, which we see lies in the thought, and to what principle shall we refer it? Have poets a privilege to alter the nature of things, and at pleasure to bestow attributes upon a subject to which they do not belong? It is observed, that the mind passeth easily and sweetly along a train of connected objects; and, where the objects are intimately connected, that it is disposed to carry along the good or bad properties of one to another; especially when it is in any degree inflamed with these properties. From this principle is derived the figure under consideration. Language, invented for the communication of thought, would be imperfect, if it were not expressive even of the slightest propensities and more delicate feelings: but language cannot remain so imperfect among a people who have received any polish; because language is regulated by internal feeling, and is gradually improved to express whatever passes in the mind. Thus for example, when a sword in the hand of a coward is termed a coward sword, the expression is significative of an internal operation; for the mind, in passing from the agent to its instrument, is disposed to extend to the latter the properties of the former. Governed by the same principle, we say liftening fear, by extending the attribute liftening of the man who listens, to the passion with which he is moved.\n\nIn the expression bold deed, or audax facinus, we extend to the effect what properly belongs to the cause. But not to waste time by making a commentary upon every expression of this kind, the best way to give a complete view of the subject, is to exhibit a table of the different relations that may give occasion to this figure. And in viewing the table, it will be observed, that the figure can never have any grace but where the relations are of the most intimate kind.\n\n1. An attribute of the cause expressed as an attribute of the effect.\n\nAudax facinus.\nOf yonder fleet a bold discovery make.\nAn impious mortal gave the daring wound.\n\nTo my adventrous song,\nThat with no middle flight intends to soar.\n\nParadise Lost.\n\n2. An attribute of the effect expressed as an attribute of the cause.\n\nQuos periisse ambos miifero cenfebam in mari.\n\nPlautus.\n\nNo wonder, fallen such a pernicious height.\n\nParadise Lost.\n\n3. An effect expressed as an attribute of the cause.\n\nJovial wine, Giddy brink, Drowsy night, Musing midnight, Panting height, Astonish'd thought, Mournful gloom.\n\nCausing a dim religious light.\n\nMilton, Comus.\n\nAnd the merry bells ring round,\nAnd the jovial rebecks sound.\n\nMilton, Allegro.\n\n4. An attribute of a subject bestowed upon one of its parts or members.\n\nLonging arms.\nIt was the nightingale, and not the lark,\nThat pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.\n\nRomeo and Juliet, act iii. sc. 7.\n\nOh, lay by\nThose most ungentle looks and angry weapons:\nUnless you mean my griefs and killing fears\nShould stretch me out at your relentless feet.\n\nFair Penitent, act iii.\n\nAnd ready now\nTo stoop with wearied wing, and willing feet,\nOn the bare outside of this world.\n\nParadise Lost, book iii.\n\n5. A quality of the agent given to the instrument with which it operates.\n\nWhy peep your coward swords half out their shells?\n\n6. An attribute of the agent given to the subject upon which it operates.\n\nHigh-climbing hill.\n\nMilton.\n\n7. A quality of one subject given to another.\n\nIcci, beatis nunc Arabum invides\nGazis.\n\nHorat. Carm. lib. i. ode 29.\n\nWhen sapless age, and weak, unable limbs,\nShould bring thy father to his drooping chair.\n\nShakespeare.\nBy art, the pilot through the boiling deep,\nAnd howling tempest, steers the fearless ship.\nIliad, book xxiii. l. 385.\n\nThen, nothing loth, th' enamour'd fair he led,\nAnd sunk transported on the conscious bed.\nOdyssey, book viii. l. 337.\n\nA stupid moment motionless the flood.\nSummer, l. 1336.\n\n8. A circumstance connected with a subject, expressed as a quality of the subject.\nBreezy summit.\n\n'Tis ours the chance of fighting fields to try,\nIliad, book i. l. 301.\n\nOh! had I dy'd before that well-fought wall.\nOdyssey, book v. l. 395.\n\nFrom this table it appears, that the adorning a cause with an attribute of the effect, is not so agreeable as the opposite expression. The progress from cause to effect is natural and easy; the opposite progress resembles retrograde motion; and therefore panting height, afflonted thought, are strained and uncouth expressions, which a writer of taste will avoid.\n\nIt is not least strained, to apply to a subject in its present state, an epithet that may belong to it in some future state:\n\nSubmersaque obnue puppes. Eneid, book i. l. 73.\n\nAnd mighty ruins fall. Iliad, book v. l. 411.\n\nImpious sons their mangled fathers wound.\n\nAnother rule regards this figure, That the property of one subject ought not to be bestowed upon another with which the property is incongruous.\n\nK. Rich. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014How dare thy joints forget\nTo pay their awful duty to our presence?\nRichard II, act. iii. sc. 6.\n\nThe connexion between an awful superior and his submissive dependent is so intimate, that an attribute may readily be transferred from the one to the other; but awfulness cannot be so transferred, because it is inconsistent with submission.\n\nFigure of Speech, as peculiarly distinguished from the above and from those first referred to.] Under the article Metaphor and Allegory, a figure of speech is defined, \"The using a word in a sense different from what is proper to it;\" and the new or uncommon sense of the word is termed the figurative sense. The figurative sense must have a relation to that which is proper; and the more intimate the relation is, the figure is the more happy. How ornamental this figure is to language, will not be readily imagined by any one who hath not given peculiar attention; and therefore we shall endeavour to unfold its capital beauties and advantages. In the first place, a word used figuratively, or in a new sense, suggests at the same time the sense it commonly bears; and thus it has the effect to present two objects; one signified by the figurative sense, which may be termed the principal object; and one signified by the proper sense, which may be termed accessory; the principal makes a part of the thought; the accessory is merely ornamental. In this respect, a figure of speech is precisely similar to concordant sounds in music, which, without contributing to the melody, make it harmonious.\n\nTo explain the matter by examples. Youth, by a figure of speech, is termed the morning of life: This expression signifies youth, the principal object which enters into the thought; it suggests, at the same time, the proper sense of morning; and this accessory object, being in itself beautiful, and connected by resemblance to the principal object, is not a little ornamental. Imperious ocean is an example of a different kind, where an attribute is expressed figuratively: Together with stormy, the figurative meaning of the epithet imperious, where is suggested its proper meaning, viz., the stern authority of a despotic prince; and these two are strongly connected by resemblance. Upon this figurative power of words, Vida descants with elegance, Poet. lib. iii. l. 44.\n\nIn the next place, this figure possesses a signal power of aggrandizing an object, by the following means.\u2014Words, which have no original beauty but what arises from their sound, acquire an adventitious beauty from their meaning: a word signifying anything that is agreeable, becomes by that means agreeable; for the agreeableness of the object is communicated to its name. This acquired beauty, by the force of custom, adheres to the word even when used figuratively; and the beauty received from the thing it properly signifies, is communicated to the thing which it is made to signify figuratively. Consider the foregoing expression Imperious ocean, how much more elevated it is than Stormy ocean.\n\nThirdly, This figure hath a happy effect by preventing the familiarity of proper names. The familiarity of a proper name is communicated to the thing it signifies by means of their intimate connexion; and the thing is thereby brought down in our feeling. This bad effect is prevented by using a figurative word instead of one that is proper: as for example, when we express the sky by terming it the blue vault of heaven; for though no work of art can compare with the sky in grandeur, the expression however is relished, because it prevents the object from being brought down by the familiarity of its proper name. With respect to the degrading the familiarity of proper names, Vida has the following passage:\n\nHinc si dura mihi paffus dicendus Ulysses,\nNon illum vero memorabo nomine, sed qui\nEt mores hominum multorum vidit, et urbes,\nNaufragus everfice poft fveva incendia Trojae.\nPoet. lib. ii. l. 460.\n\nLastly, By this figure, language is enriched, and rendered more copious; in which respect, were there no other, a figure of speech is a happy invention. This property is finely touched by Vida; Poet. lib. iii. l. 90.\n\nThe beauties we have mentioned belong to every figure of speech. Several other beauties, peculiar to one or other sort, we shall have occasion to remark afterward.\n\nNot only subjects, but qualities, actions, effects, may be expressed figuratively. Thus, as to subjects, gates of breath for the lips, the watery kingdom for the ocean. As to qualities, fierce for stormy, in the expression Fierce winter; allus for profound, Altus puteus, Altum mare;\nFigure. mare; breathing for perspiring, Breathing plants. Again, as to actions, The sea rages, Time will melt her frozen thoughts, Time kills grief. An effect is put for the cause, as lux for the sun; and a cause for the effect, as bonum laboris for corn. The relation of resemblance is one plentiful source of figures of speech; and nothing is more common than to apply to one object the name of another that resembles it in any respect: Height, size, and worldly greatness, resemble not each other; but the emotions they produce resemble each other, and, prompted by this resemblance, we naturally express worldly greatness by height or size: One feels a certain uneasiness in feeling a great depth; and, hence depth is made to express anything disagreeable by excess, as depth of grief, depth of despair; Again, Height of place, and time long past, produce similar feelings; and hence the expression, Ut alius repetam! Distance in past time, producing a strong feeling, is put for any strong feeling; Nihil mihi antiquus nofra amicitia: Shortness with relation to space, for shortness with relation to time; Brevis effe laboro, obfcurus fio: Suffering a punishment resembles paying a debt; hence pendere penas. In the same manner, light may be put for glory, sunshine for prosperity, and weight for importance.\n\nMany words, originally figurative, having, by long and constant use, lost their figurative power, are degraded to the inferior rank of proper terms. Thus the words that express the operation of the mind, have in all languages been originally figurative: the reason holds in all, that when these operations came first under consideration, there was no other way of describing them but by what they resembled: it was not practicable to give them proper names, as may be done to objects that can be ascertained by sight and touch. A soft nature, jarring tempers, weight of woe, pompous phrase, beget compassion, affluage grief, break a vow, bend the eye downward, bow down curles, drowning in tears, wrapt in joy, warm'd with eloquence, loaded with spoils, and a thousand other expressions of the like nature, have lost their figurative sense. Some terms there are that cannot be said to be altogether figurative or altogether proper: originally figurative, they are tending to simplicity, without having lost altogether their figurative power. Virgil's Regina faucis cura, is perhaps one of these expressions: with ordinary readers, faucis will be considered as expressing simply the effect of grief; but one of a lively imagination will exalt the phrase into a figure.\n\nFor epitomizing this subject, and at the same time for giving a clear view of it, Lord Kames gives a list of the several relations upon which figures of speech are commonly founded. This list he divides into two tables; one of subjects expressed figuratively, and one of attributes.\n\n**Tab. I. Subjects expressed figuratively.**\n\n1. A word proper to one subject employed figuratively to express a resembling subject.\n\nThere is no figure of speech so frequent, as what is derived from the relation of resembling. Youth, for example, is signified figuratively by the morning of life. The life of a man resembles a natural day in several particulars: the morning is the beginning of a day, youth the beginning of life; the morning is cheerful, so is youth, &c. By another resemblance, a bold warrior is termed the thunderbolt of war; a multitude of troubles, a sea of troubles.\n\nThis figure, above all others, affords pleasure to the mind by variety of beauties. Besides the beauties above mentioned, common to all sorts, it possesses in particular the beauty of a metaphor or a simile: a figure of speech built upon resemblance, suggests always a comparison between the principal subject and the accessory; whereby every good effect of a metaphor or simile may, in a short and lively manner, be produced by this figure of speech.\n\n2. A word proper to the effect employed figuratively to express the cause.\n\nLux for the sun; Shadow for cloud. A helmet is signified by the expression glittering terror; a tree by shadow or umbrage. Hence the expression,\n\nNec habet Pelion umbras. OVID.\n\nWhere the dun umbrage hangs. Spring, l. 1023.\n\nA wound is made to signify an arrow:\n\nVulnere non pedibus te consecuar. OVID.\n\nThere is a peculiar force and beauty in this figure: the word which signifies figuratively the principal subject, denotes it to be a cause by suggesting the effect.\n\n3. A word proper to the cause employed figuratively to express the effect.\n\nBoumque labores for corn. Sorrow or grief for tears.\n\nAgain Ulysses weild his penive head;\n\nAgain unmann'd, a flow'r of sorrow thied.\n\nStreaming grief his faded cheek bedew'd,\n\nBlindness for darkness:\n\nC\u00e6cis erramus in undis. \u00c6neid. iii. 200.\n\nThere is a peculiar energy in this figure, similar to that in the former: the figurative name denotes the subject to be an effect by suggesting its cause.\n\n4. Two things being intimately connected, the proper name of the one employed figuratively to signify the other.\n\nDay for light. Night for darkness; and hence, A sudden night.\n\nWinter for a storm at sea:\n\nInterea magno militer murmure pontum,\n\nEmiliamque Hyemem senuit Neptunus. \u00c6neid. i. 128.\n\nThis last figure would be too bold for a British writer, as a storm at sea is not inseparably connected with winter in this climate.\n\n5.

Mountains for the sheep pasturing upon them; Bleating mountains. Zacynthus, Ithaca, &c. for the inhabitants; Ex mefii domibus. Livy.\n\n11. The name of the sustainer, employed figuratively to signify what is sustained.\nAltar for the sacrifice. Field for the battle fought upon it; Well-fought field.\n\n12. The name of the materials, employed figuratively to signify the things made of them.\nFerrum for gladius.\n\n13. The names of the Heathen deities, employed figuratively to signify what they patronize.\nJove for the air, Mars for war, Venus for beauty, Cupid for love, Ceres for corn, Neptune for the sea, Vulcan for fire.\n\nThis figure befores great elevation upon the subject; and therefore ought to be confined to the higher strains of poetry.\n\nTab. II. Attributes expressed figuratively.\n\n1. When two attributes are connected, the name of the one may be employed figuratively to express the other.\nPurity and virginity are attributes of the same person; hence the expression, Virgin know, for pure know.\n\n2. A word signifying properly an attribute of one subject, employed figuratively to express a resembling attribute of another subject.\nTottering state. Imperious ocean. Angry flood. Raging tempest. Shallow fears.\n\nMy sure divinity shall bear the shield,\nAnd edge thy sword to reap the glorious field.\nOdyssey, book xx. l. 61.\n\nBlack omen, for an omen that portends bad fortune.\nAter omen.\nVirgil.\n\nThe peculiar beauty of this figure arises from suggesting a comparison.\n\n3. A word proper to the subject, employed to express one of its attributes.\nMens for intellectus. Mens for a resolution:\nIstam, oro, exue mentem.\n\n4. When two subjects have a resemblance by a common quality, the name of the one subject may be employed figuratively to denote that quality in the other:\nSummer life for agreeable life.\n\n5. The name of the instrument made to signify the power of employing it:\nMelpomene, cui liquidam pater\nVocem cum euthara dedit.\n\nThe ample field of figurative expression displayed in these tables, affords great scope for reasoning. Several of the observations relating to metaphor, are applicable to figures of speech: these shall be slightly retouched, together, with some additions peculiarly adapted to the present subject.\n\n1. As the figure under consideration is built upon relation, we find from experience, and it must be obvious from reason, that the beauty of it depends on the intimacy of the relation between the figurative and proper sense of the word. A slight resemblance, in particular, will never make this figure agreeable: the expression, for example, Drink down a secret, for listening to a secret with attention, is harsh and uncouth, because there is scarce any resemblance between listening and drinking. The expression weighty crack, used by Ben Jonson for loud crack, is worse if possible; a loud sound has not the slightest resemblance to a piece of matter that is weighty.\n\nPhemius! let acts of gods, and heroes old,\nWhat ancient bards in hall and bow'r have told;\nAttemper'd\nAttemper'd to the lyre, your voice employ,\nSuch the pleas'd ear will drink with silent joy.\n*Odyssey*, book i. l. 433.\n\nStrepitumque exterritus haust.\n*\u00c6neid*, book vi. l. 559.\n\nWrite, my queen,\nAnd with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send.\n*Cymbeline*, act i. sc. 2.\n\nAs thus th' effulgence tremulous I drink.\n*Summer*, l. 1684.\n\nNeque audit currus habenas.\n*Georg.*, book i. l. 514.\n\nO prince! (Lycaon's valiant son reply'd),\nAs thine the steeds, be thine the talk to guide.\nThe horses practis'd to their lord's command,\nShall hear the rein, and answer to thy hand.\n*Iliad*, book v. l. 288.\n\nThe following figures of speech seem altogether wild and extravagant, the figurative and proper meaning having no connexion whatever. *Moving softness*, *Freshness breather*, *Breathing prospect*, *Flowing spring*, *Dewy light*, *Lucid coolness*, and many others of this false coin, may be found in Thomson's *Seasons*.\n\n2. The proper sense of the word ought to bear some proportion to the figurative sense, and not soar much above it, nor sink much below it. This rule, as well as the foregoing, is finely illustrated by Vida, *Poet.*, book iii. l. 148.\n\n3. In a figure of speech, every circumstance ought to be avoided that agrees with the proper sense only, not with the figurative sense: for it is the latter that expresses the thought, and the former serves for no other purpose but to make harmony:\n\nZacynthus green with ever-shady groves,\nAnd Ithaca, presumptuous boast their loves;\nObtruding on my choice a second lord,\nThey press the Hymenean rite abhorred.\n*Odyssey*, book xix. l. 152.\n\nZacynthus here standing figuratively for the inhabitants, the description of the island is quite out of place: it puzzles the reader, by making him doubt whether the word ought to be taken in its proper or figurative sense.\n\nWrite, my queen,\nAnd with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,\nThough ink be made of gall.\n*Cymbeline*, act i. sc. 2.\n\nThe difficult one has to drink ink in reality, is not to the purpose where the subject is drinking ink figuratively.\n\n4. To draw consequences from a figure of speech, as if the word were to be understood literally, is a gross absurdity; for it is confounding truth with fiction:\n\nBe Moubray's sins so heavy in his bosom,\nThat they may break his foaming courser's back,\nAnd throw the rider headlong in the lists,\nA caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford.\n*Ricard II.*, act i. sc. 3.\n\nSin may be imagined heavy in a figurative sense: but weight in a proper sense belongs to the accessory only; and therefore to describe the effects of weight, is to defer the principal subject, and to convert the accessory into a principal:\n\nCromwell. How does your Grace?\nWolsey. Why, well;\nNever so truly happy, my good Cromwell.\nI know myself now, and I feel within me\nA peace above all earthly dignities,\nA still and quiet conscience. The king has cur'd me,\nI humbly thank his Grace: and, from these shoulders,\nThese ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken\nA load would sink a navy, too much honour.\n*Henry VIII.*, act iii. sc. 6.\n\nUlysses speaking of Hector\u2014\n\nI wonder now how yonder city stands,\nWhen we have here the base and pillar by us.\n*Troilus and Cressida*, Act. iv. Sc. 9.\n\nOthello. No; my heart is turned to stone: I strike it, and it hurts my hand.\n*Othello*, act. iv. sc. 5.\n\nNor lest, even in this delusive show,\nThan when my name fill'd Afric with affrights,\nAnd froze your hearts beneath your torrid zone.\n*Don Sebastian King of Portugal*, act. i.\n\nHow long a space, since first I lov'd, it is!\nTo look into a glas I fear,\nAnd am surpris'd with wonder, when I miss\nGray hairs and wrinkles there.\n*Cowley*, vol. i. p. 86.\n\nI chose the flourishing't tree in all the park,\nWith freshest boughs and fairest head;\nI cut my love into its gentle bark,\nAnd in three days behold 'tis dead;\nMy very written flames so violent be,\nThey've burnt and wither'd up the tree.\n*Cowley*, vol. i. p. 136.\n\nAh, mighty Love, that it were inward heat\nWhich made this precious limbeck sweat!\nBut what, alas! ah, what does it avail,\nThat she weeps tears so wondrous cold,\nAs scarce the ass's hoof can hold,\nSo cold, that I admire they fall not hail!\n*Cowley*, vol. i. p. 132.\n\nSuch a play of words is pleasant in a ludicrous poem.\n\nAlmeria. O Alphonso, Alphonso!\nDevouring seas have wash'd thee from my sight,\nNo time shall raze thee from my memory:\nNo, I will live to be thy monument:\nThe cruel ocean is no more thy tomb;\nBut in my heart thou art interr'd.\n*Mourning Bride*, act i. sc. 1.\n\nThis would be very right, if there were any inconsistence in being interred in one place really, and in another place figuratively.\n\nFrom considering, that a word used in a figurative sense suggests at the same time its proper meaning, we discover a fifth rule, That we ought not to employ a word in a figurative sense, the proper sense of which is inconsistent or incongruous with the subject: for every inconsistence, and even incongruity, though in the expression only and not real, is unpleasant:\nInterca genitor Tyberini ad flaminis undam,\nVulnera fecerat lymphis.\n\n*\u00c6neid*, book x. l. 833.\n\nTres adeo incertus creca caligine soles\nErramus pelago, totidem sine fidele noctes.\n\n*\u00c6neid*, book iii. l. 293.\n\nThe foregoing rule may be extended to form a sixth, That no epithet ought to be given to the figurative sense of a word that agrees not also with its proper sense:\n\nDicat Opuntice\nFrater Megilla, quo beatus\nVulnere.\n*Horat.* Carm. lib. i. ode 27.\n\nParcus deorum cultor, et infrequens,\nIsonenitium dum sapientiae\nConsultus erro.\n*Horat.* Carm. lib. i. ode 54.\n\nSeventhly, The crowding into one period or thought different figures of speech, is not less faulty than crowding metaphors in that manner; the mind is distracted in the quick transition from one image to another, and is puzzled instead of being pleased:\n\nI am of ladies most deject and wretched,\nThat fuck'd the honey of his music vows. *Hamlet.*\n\nMy bleeding bosom fickens at the sound.\n\n*Odyssey*, book i. l. 439.\n\nAh mihi,\nQuanta laboras in Charybdi!\nDigne puer meliore flamma.\nQuae faga, quis te solvere Thelalis\nMagus veniens, qua poterit Deus:\nVix illigatum tetriformi\nPegasus expedit Chimera.\n*Horat.* Carm. lib. i. ode 27.\n\nEighthly, If crowding figures be bad, it is still worse to graft one figure upon another: For instance,\n\nWhile his keen falchion drinks the warriors lives.\n\n*Iliad*, book xi. l. 271.\n\nA falchion drinking the warriors blood, is a figure built upon resemblance, which is passable. But then in the expression, lives is again put for blood; and by thus grafting one figure upon another, the expression is rendered obscure and unpleasant.\n\nNinthly, Intricate and involved figures, that can scarce be analyzed, or reduced to plain language, are least of all tolerable:\n\nVotis incendimus aras.\n*\u00c6neid*, book iii. l. 279.\n\nOnerentique canistris\nDona laborate Cereris\n*\u00c6neid*, book viii. l. 180.\n\nVulcan to the Cyclops:\n\nArma acri facienda viro: nunc viribus usus,\nNunc manibus rapidis, omni nunc arte magistra:\nPrecipitate moras.\n*\u00c6neid*, book viii. l. 441.\n\nHuic gladio, perque area scuta,\nPer tunicum squalentem auro, latus haurit apertum.\n*\u00c6neid*, book x. l. 313.\n\nScriberis Vario fortis, et hosfium\nVictor, M\u00e6onii carminis alie.\n*Horat.* Carm. lib. i. ode 6.\n\nElfe shall our fates be number'd with the dead.\n\n*Iliad*, book v. l. 294.\n\nCommunal death the fate of war confounds.\n\n*Iliad*, book viii. l. 85, and book xi. l. 117.\n\nSpeaking of Proteus:\n\nInstant he wears, elusive of the rape,\nThe mimic force of every savage shape.\n\n*Odyssey*, book iv. l. 563.\n\nRolling convulsive on the floor, is seen\nThe piteous object of a prostrate queen.\n\n*Ibid.* book iv. l. 652.\n\nThe mingling tempest weaves its gloom.\n\n*Autumn*, l. 337.\n\nA various sweetness swells the gentle race.\n\n*Ibid.*, l. 640.\n\nThe distant waterfall swells in the breeze.\n\n*Winter*, l. 738.\n\nIn the tenth place, When a subject is introduced by its proper name, it is absurd to attribute to it the properties of a different subject to which the word is sometimes applied in a figurative sense:\n\nHear me, Oh Neptune! thou whose arms are hurl'd\nFrom shore to shore, and gird the fold world.\n\n*Odyssey*, book ix. l. 617.\n\nNeptune is here introduced personally, and not figuratively, for the ocean; the description therefore, which is only applicable to the latter, is altogether improper.\n\nIt is not sufficient that a figure of speech be regularly constructed, and be free from blemish; it requires taste to discern when it is proper, when improper; and taste perhaps is our only guide. One, however, may gather from reflections and experience, that ornaments and graces suit not any of the disfiguring passions, nor are proper for expressing anything grave and important. In familiar conversation, they are in some measure ridiculous: Prospero, in the *Tempest*, speaking to his daughter Miranda, says,\n\nThe fringed curtains of thine eyes advance,\nAnd say what thou feel'st fond.\n\nNo exception can be taken to the justness of the figure; and circumstances may be imagined to make it proper: but it is certainly not proper in familiar conversation.\n\nIn the last place, Though figures of speech have a charming effect when accurately constructed and properly introduced, they ought, however, to be scattered with a sparing hand; nothing is more ludicrous, and nothing consequently more fatiguing, than redundant ornaments of any kind.\n\nFigure is used, in Theology, for the mysteries represented or delivered obscurely to us under certain types, or actions in the Old Testament. Thus manna is held a figure or type of the eucharist; and the death of Abel a figure of the suffering of Christ.\n\nMany divines and critics contend, that all the actions, histories, ceremonies, &c. of the Old Testament, are only figures, types, and prophecies, of what was to happen under the New. The Jews are supposed\nFigure to have had the figures or shadows, and we the substance.\n\nFigure is also applied in a like sense to profane matters; as the emblems, enigmas, fables, symbols, and hieroglyphics, of the ancients.","sp":231,"ep":239},{"h":"FIGURED","t":"in general, something marked with figures.\n\nThe term figured is chiefly applied to stuffs, whereon the figures of flowers, and the like, are either wrought or stamped.\n\nFigured, in Music, is applied either to simple notes or to harmony: to simple notes, as in these words figured bass, to express a bass whose notes carrying chords are subdivided into many other notes of lesser value; to harmony, when, by supposition and in a diatonic procedure, other notes than those which form the chord are employed. See Supposition.\n\nTo figure is to put several notes for one; to form runnings or variations; to add some notes to the air, in whatever manner it be done; in short, it is to give to harmonious sounds a figure of melody, by connecting them with other intermediate sounds.","sp":239,"ep":239},{"h":"FILAGO","t":"a genus of plants, belonging to the syn-genesia clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 49th order, Compositae.

See Fibre.\n\nVegetable Filaments form a substance of great use in the arts and manufactures; furnishing thread, cloth, cordage, &c.\n\nFor these purposes the filamentous parts of the Cannabis and Linum, or hemp and flax, are employed among us. But different vegetables have been employed in different countries for the same uses. Putrefaction destroys the pulpy or flabby matter, and leaves the tough filaments entire: By putrefying the leaf of a plant in water, we obtain the fine flexible fibres, which constituted the basis of the ribs and minute veins, and which now form as it were a skeleton of the leaf. Alkaline lye, in some degree, produce similar effects to putrefaction.\n\nThe Sieur de Flacourt, in his history of Madagascar, relates, that different kinds of cloth are prepared in that island from the filaments of the bark of certain trees boiled in strong lye; that some of these cloths are very fine, and approach to the softness of silk; but in durability come short of cotton; that others are coarser and stronger, and last thrice as long as cotton; and that of these the fails and cordage of his vessel were made. See also the article Bark.\n\nThe same author informs us, that the stalks of nettles are used for the like purposes in his own country, France. And Sir Hans Sloane relates, in one of his letters to Mr Ray, that he has been informed by several, that muslin and calico, and most of the Indian linens, are made of nettles.\n\nIn some of the Swedish provinces, a strong kind of cloth is said to be prepared from hop stalks: and in the transactions of the Swedish Academy for the year 1750, there is an account of an experiment made in consequence of that report. Of the stalks, gathered in autumn, about as many were taken as equalled in bulk a quantity of flax that would have produced a pound after preparation. The stalks were put into water, and kept covered therewith during the winter. In March they were taken out, dried in a stove, and dressed as flax. The prepared filaments weighed nearly a pound, and proved fine, soft, and white: They were spun and woven into six ells of fine strong cloth. The author, Mr Shiller, observes, that hop stalks take much longer time to rot than flax; and that, if not fully rotted, the woody part will not separate, and the cloth will neither prove white nor fine.\n\nHemp, flax, and all other vegetable filaments, and thread or cloth prepared from them, differ remarkably from wool, hair, silk, and other animal productions, not only in the principles into which they are reducible by fire, but likewise in some of their more interesting properties, particularly in their disposition to imbibe colouring matters; sundry liquors, which give a beautiful and durable dye to those of the animal, giving no stain at all to those of the vegetable kingdom.\n\nA solution of copper in aquafortis, which had been changed blue by an addition of volatile spirit, on being mixed with a little solution of tin, became turbid and greenish. Pieces of white silk and flannel boiled, without any previous preparation, in this mixture, received a bright deep yellow dye; whilst pieces of linen, prepared and unprepared, came out as colourless as they were put in.\n\nFishing nets are usually boiled with oak bark or other like astringents, which render them more lasting. Those made of flax receive from this decoction a brownish colour, which, by the repeated alternations of water and air, is in a little time discharged, whilst the fine glossy brown, communicated by the same means to silken nets, permanently resists both the air and water, and stands as long as the animal filaments themselves. In like manner the stain of ink, or the black dye from solutions of iron, mixed with vegetable astringents, proves durable in silk and woollen; but from linen, the astringent matter is extracted by washing, and only the yellow iron would remain.\n\nThe red decoction of cochineal, which, heightened with a little solution of tin, gives the fiery scarlet dye to wool or silk that have been previously impregnated with solution of tartar, makes no impression upon linen or cotton prepared in the same manner. M. du Fay informs us, in the Memoirs of the French Academy for the year 1737, that having prepared a mixed cloth whose warp was of wool and the woof of cotton, and thoroughly blended the two together by fulling, he still found the cotton to resist the action of the scarlet liquor, and the wool to receive the same colour from it as wool by itself, the stuff coming out all over mottled fiery and white.\n\nMany other instances of this kind are known too well to the calico printer; whose grand desideratum it is, to find means of making linen receive the same colours that wool does. The physical cause of the difference is wholly unknown; and indeed, of the theory of dyes in general, we know as yet extremely little. (See Dyeing.) Are animal filaments tubular, and the colouring atoms received within them? Are vegetable filaments solid, and the colour deposited on the surface? Or, does not their different susceptibility of colour depend rather on the different intrinsic properties of the two? There are many instances of a like diversity, even in...\nFilaments in the metallic kingdom, where a mechanical difference in texture can scarcely be presumed to be the cause: Thus silver receives a deep stain from sulphurous or putrid vapours, or the yolk of a boiled egg, which have no effect upon tin.\n\nFilaments, among botanists.

The disease proceeds from bad food; and must be remedied in time, to prevent its spreading over the whole body, and destroying the bird. These must not be killed as other worms are, for fear of impotencies from their corruption, being incapable of passing away with the hawk\u2019s meat. They must only be flupified, to prevent their being offensive; and this is done by giving the hawk a clove of garlic, after which she will feel nothing of the filanders for 40 days.

After cutting the file, it must be tempered with a composition of chimney foot, very hard and dry, diluted and wrought upon with urine, vinegar, and salt, the whole being reduced to the consistence of mustard. Tempering the files consists in rubbing them over with this composition, and covering them in loam; after which they are put in a charcoal fire, and taken out by that time they have acquired a cherry colour, which is known by a small rod of the same steel put along with them. Being taken out of the fire, they are thrown into cold spring water; and, when cold, they are cleaned with charcoal and a rag; and being clean and dry, are kept from rust by laying them up in wheat bran. Iron files require more heating than steel ones. Files are of different forms, sizes, cuts, and degrees of fineness, according to the different uses and occasions for which they are made.

See Son.\n\nThe divines usually distinguish between a servile and a filial fear. The most abandoned may have a servile fear of God, such as that of a slave to his master; but not a filial fear, i.e., a fear resulting from love and respect. See Fear.\n\nFilial Piety, the affectionate attachment of children to their parents; including in it love, reverence, obedience, and relief. These are duties prompted equally by nature and by gratitude, independent of the injunctions of religion. For where shall we find the person who hath received from any one benefits so great or so many, as children from their parents? And it may be truly said, that if persons are undutiful to their parents, they seldom prove good to any other relation. Profane history furnishes many fine examples of this amiable virtue; a few of which we shall select, according to the plan observed in other similar articles.\n\n1. The Roman dictator T. Manlius having exercised great cruelty over the citizens, was cited at the expiration of his office to answer for his conduct. Among other things that were laid to his charge, he was accused of treating with barbarity one of his own sons. Manlius, according to Livy, had no other cause of complaint against this son than his having an impediment in his speech. For this reason he was banished far from the city, from his home, and the company of those of his own age and fortune, and condemned to servile works. All were highly exasperated against such inhuman conduct, except the son himself, who, under the greatest concern that he should furnish matter of accusation against his father, resorted upon a most extraordinary method to relieve him. One morning, without apprising any body, he came to the city armed with a dagger, and went directly to the house of the tribune Pomponius, who had accused his father. Pomponius was yet in bed. Young Manlius sent up his name, and was immediately admitted by the tribune, who did not doubt but he was come to discover to him some new instances of his father\u2019s severity. But Manlius, as soon as he was left alone with the tribune, drew out his dagger, and presented it to his breast; declaring he would stab him that moment if he did not swear in the form he should dictate, \u201cNever to hold the assembly of the people for accusing his father.\u201d Pomponius, who saw the dagger glittering at his breast, himself alone without arms, Liv. 1.7. and attacked by a robust young man, full of a bold confidence in his own strength, took the oath demanded of him; and afterwards contended with a kind of complacency in the thing, and a sincerity which sufficiently...\ncidently argued he was not sorry for what he had done, that it was that violence which obliged him to desist from his design.\n\n2. Among the multitude of persons who were proscribed under the second triumvirate of Rome, were the celebrated orator Cicero and his brother Quintus. The fate of the former, in endeavouring to make his escape, is related under the article Cicero. The latter found means to conceal himself so effectually at home, that the soldiers could not find him. Enraged at their disappointment, they put his son to the torture, in order to make him discover the place of his father's concealment; but filial affection was proof against the most exquisite torments. An involuntary sigh, and sometimes a deep groan, was all that could be extorted from the youth. His agonies were increased; but with amazing fortitude he still persisted in his resolution of not betraying his father. Quintus was not far off; and it may be imagined better than can be expressed, how his heart must have been affected with the sighs and groans of a son expiring in tortures to save his life. He could bear it no longer; but quitting the place of his concealment, he presented himself to the assassins, begging of them to put him to death, and dismiss the innocent youth, whose generous behaviour the triumvirs themselves, if informed of the fact, would judge worthy of the highest approbation. But the inhuman monsters, without being the least affected with the tears either of the father or the son, answered, that they both must die; the father because he was proscribed, and the son because he had concealed his father.\n\nThen a new contest of tenderminds arose who should die first; but this the assassins soon decided, by beheading them both at the same time.\u2014This anecdote is related by Appian, Dio, Plutarch, Valerius Maximus, and other historians.\n\n3. Cinna, who scrupled no attempt, how atrocious soever, which could serve his purpose, undertook to get Pomponius Strabo murdered in his tent; but his son saved his life, which was the first remarkable action of Pompey the Great. The treacherous Cinna, by many alluring promises, had gained over one Terentius, a confidant of Pompey's, and prevailed on him to affiancet the general, and seduce his troops. Young Pompey being informed of this design a few hours before it was to be put in execution, placed a faithful guard round the praetorium; so that none of the conspirators could come near it. He then watched all the motions of the camp, and endeavoured to appease the fury of the soldiers, who hated the general his father, by such acts of prudence as were worthy of the oldest commanders. However, some of the mutineers having forced open one of the gates of the camp, in order to desert to Cinna, the general's son threw himself flat on his back in their way, crying out, that they should not break their oath and desert their commander, without treading his body to death. By this means he put a stop to their defection, and afterwards wrought so effectually upon them by his affecting speeches and engaging carriage, that he reconciled them to his father.\n\n4. Olympias, Alexander's own mother, was of such an unhappy disposition, that he would never allow her to have any concern in the affairs of the government. She used frequently to make very severe complaints on that account; but he always submitted to her ill humour with great mildness and patience. Antipater, one of his friends, having one day written a long letter against her to the king then absent, the latter, after reading it, replied, \"Antipater does not know that one single tear shed by a mother will obliterate ten thousand such letters as this.\" A behaviour like this, and such an answer, show at one and the same time, that Alexander was both an affectionate son and an able politician.\n\n5. Epaminondas is universally acknowledged to have been one of the greatest generals and one of the best men which Greece ever produced. Before him the city of Thebes was not distinguished by any memorable action, and after him it was not famous for its virtues, but its misfortunes, till it sunk into its original obscurity; so that it saw its glory take birth and expire with this great man. The victory he obtained at Leuctra had drawn the eyes and admiration of all the neighbouring people upon Epaminondas, who looked upon him as the support of Thebes, as the triumphant conqueror of Sparta, as the deliverer of Greece: in a word, as the greatest man, and the most excellent captain, that ever was in the world. In the midst of this universal applause, so capable of making the general of an army forget the man for the victor, Epaminondas, little sensible to so affecting and so deserved a glory, \"My joy (said he) arises from my sense of that which the news of my victory will give my father and my mother.\"\n\n6. Among an incredible number of illustrious persons who were falsely accused and put to death by Nero, was one Barcas Soranus; a man, as Tacitus informs us, of singular vigilance and justice in the discharge of his duty. During his confinement, his daughter Servilia was apprehended and brought into the senate, and there arraigned. The crime laid to her charge was, that she had turned into money all her ornaments and jewels, and the most valuable part of her dress, to defray the expense of consulting magicians. To this the young Servilia, with tears, replied, That she had indeed consulted magicians, but the whole of her inquiry was to know whether the emperor and senate would afford protection and safety to her dear and indulgent parent against his accusers. \"With this view (said she) I presented the diviners, men till now utterly unknown to me, with my jewels, apparel, and the other ornaments peculiar to my quality, as I would have presented my blood and life, could my blood and life have procured my father's liberty. But whatever this my proceeding was, my unfortunate father was an utter stranger to it; and if it is a crime, I alone am the delinquent.\" She was, however, together with her father, condemned to die; but in what manner, history is silent. [Vid. Taciti Annales, lib. vi. cap. 20.]\n\n7. Valerius Maximus likewise relates a very singular fact upon this subject. A woman of illustrious birth had been condemned to be strangled. The Roman pretor delivered her up to the triumvir, who caused her to be carried to prison, in order to her being put to death. The gaoler, who was ordered to execute her, was struck with compassion, and could not resolve to kill her. He chose therefore to let her die of hunger. Besides which, he suffered her daughter\nFilibeg, to see her in prison; taking care, however, that she brought her nothing to eat. As this continued many days, he was surprised that the prisoner lived so long without eating; and supposing the daughter, upon watching her, he discovered that she nourished her mother with her own milk. Amazed at so pious, and at the same time so ingenious an invention, he told the fact to the triumvir, and the triumvir to the praetor, who believed the thing merited relating in the assembly of the people. The criminal was pardoned, and a decree was passed that the mother and daughter should be subsisted for the rest of their lives at the expense of the public.\n\nThe same author gives a similar instance of filial piety in a young woman named Xantippe to her aged father Cimonus, who was likewise confined in prison, and which is universally known by the name of the Roman Charity. Both these instances appeared so very extraordinary and uncommon to that people, that they could only account for them, by supposing that the love of children to their parents was the first law of nature. *Putaret aliquis* (says our author) *hoc contra naturam factum esse, nisi prima naturae lex esset diligere parentes.*\n\nIn addition to the foregoing examples, we may refer to the article *\u00c6tna*, where a very noble instance of filial piety is taken notice of.

The word is compounded of *fil* or *filum*, \"thread,\" and *granum*, \"grain.\" In Latin it is called *filatimi elaboratum opus, argentum, aurum*.\n\nThere is no manufacture in any part of the world, that has been more admired and celebrated, than the fine gold and silver fillagree of Sumatra. And what renders it a matter of greater curiosity is the coarseness of the tools employed in the workmanship, and which, in the hands of an European, would not be thought sufficiently perfect for the most ordinary purposes.\u2014They are rudely and inartificially formed, by the goldsmith (pandi) from any old iron he can pick up. When you engage one of them to execute a piece of work, his first request is usually for a piece of iron, hoop, to make his wire-drawing instrument; an old hammer head, stuck in a block, serves for an anvil; and a pair of compasses is often composed of two old nails tied together at one end. The gold is melted in a piece of a *preewo* or earthen rice-pot, or sometimes in a crucible of their own make, of ordinary clay. In general they use no bellows, but blow the fire with their mouths, through a joint of bamboo; and if the quantity of metal to be melted is considerable, three or four persons fit round their furnace, which is an old broken quailie or iron pot, and blow together. At Padang alone, where the manufacture is more considerable, they have adopted the Chinese bellows. Their method of drawing the wire differs but little from that used by European workmen. When drawn to a sufficient fineness, they flatten it by beating it on their anvil; and when flattened, they give it a twist like that in the whalebone handle of a punch ladle, by rubbing it on a block of wood with a flat stick. After twisting they again beat it on the anvil, and by these means it becomes flat wire with indented edges. With a pair of nippers they fold down the end of the wire, and thus form a leaf, or element of a flower in their work, which is cut off. The end is again folded and cut off, till they have got a sufficient number of leaves, which are all laid on singly. Patterns of the flowers or foliage, in which there is not very much variety, are prepared on paper, of the size of the gold plate on which the fillagree is to be laid. According to this, they begin to dispose on the plate the larger compartments of the foliage, for which they use plain flat wire of a larger size, and fill them up with the leaves before mentioned. To fix the work, they employ a gelatinous substance, made of the red-hot berry called *boea sagu*, ground to a pulp on a rough stone. This pulp they place on a young\nyoung cocoa nut about the size of a walnut, the top and bottom being cut off. After the leaves have been all placed in order, and stuck on, bit by bit, a folder is prepared of gold filings and borax, moistened with water, which they strew over the plate; and then putting it in the fire for a short time, the whole becomes united. This kind of work on a gold plate, they call carrang papan: when the work is open, they call it carrang troufe.\n\nIn executing the latter, the foliage is laid out on a card, or soft kind of wood, and stuck on, as before described, with the sago berry; and the work, when finished, being strewed over with their folder, is put into the fire, when the card or soft wood burning away, the gold remains connected. If the piece be large, they folder it at several times. In the manufacture of badjoo buttons, they first make the lower part flat, and having a mould formed of a piece of buffalo's horn, indented to several sizes, each like one half of a bullet mould, they lay their work over one of these holes, and with a horn punch they press it into the form of the button. After this they complete the upper part.\n\nWhen the fillagree is finished, they cleanse it, by boiling it in water with common salt and alum, or sometimes lime juice; and in order to give it that fine purple colour which they call safo, they boil it in water with brimstone. The manner of making the little balls with which their works are sometimes ornamented, is as follows: They take a piece of charcoal, and having cut it flat and smooth, they make in it a small hole, which they fill with gold dust, and this melted in the fire becomes a little ball. They are very inexpert at finishing and polishing the plain parts, hinges, screws, and the like, being in this as much excelled by the European artists, as they fall short of them in the fineness and minuteness of the foliage. The Chinese also make fillagree mostly of silver, which looks elegant, but wants likewise the extraordinary delicacy of the Malay work.\n\nThe price of the workmanship depends upon the difficulty or uncommonness of the pattern. In some articles of usual demand, it does not exceed one-third of the value of the gold; but in matters of fancy, it is generally equal to it.","sp":242,"ep":243},{"h":"FILLET","t":"or Filet, in Architecture, denotes a little square member or ornament used in divers places, and on divers occasions, but generally as a sort of cornice over a greater moulding.\n\nThe fillet is the same with what the French call reglet, bande, and bandelette; the Italians lista or listella.\n\nFillet, in Heraldry, a kind of orle or bordure, containing only a third or fourth part of the breadth of the common bordure.

One of the attendants or consequences of tenure by vallumhip\u2014KNIGHT-SERVICE, was that of fines due to the lord for every alienation, whenever the tenant had occasion to make over his land to another. This depended on the nature of the feudal connexion; it not being reasonable, nor allowed, that a feudatory should transfer his lord's gift to another, and substitute a new tenant to do the service in his own stead, without the consent of the lord: and, as the feudal obligation was considered as reciprocal, the lord also could not alienate his feignory without the consent of his tenant, which consent of his was called an attornment. The restraint upon the lord soon wore away; that upon the tenant continued longer. For, when every thing came in proceeds of time to be bought and sold, the lords would not grant a licence to their tenants to alien, without a fine being paid; apprehending that, if it was reasonable for the heir to pay a fine or relief on the renovation of his paternal estate, it was much more reasonable that a stranger should make the same acknowledgment on his acquisition of a newly purchased feud. In England, these fines seem only to have been exacted from the king's tenants in capite, who were never able to alien without a licence; but as to common persons, they were at liberty, by magna charta, and the statute of quia emptores (if not earlier), to alien the whole of their estate, to be holden of the same lord as they themselves held it of before. But the king's tenants in capite, not being included under the general words of these statutes, could not alien without a licence; for if they did, it was in ancient strictness an absolute forfeiture of the land; though some have imagined otherwise. But this severity was mitigated by the statute 1 Edw. III. c. 12. which ordained, that in such case the lands should not be forfeited, but a reasonable fine be paid to the king. Upon which statute it was settled, that one-third of the yearly value should be paid.\npaid for a license of alienation; but, if the tenant prelumed to alienate without a license, a full year's value should be paid. These fines were at last totally taken away by statute 12 Car. II. c. 24.

It is usual to add in this case, however, a considerable portion of malt, and sometimes powdered jalap, to the fermenting backs. The malt accelerates the fermentation, and makes the spirit come out the cheaper, and the jalap prevents the rise of any muddy head on the surface of the fermenting liquor, so as to leave a greater opportunity for the free access of the air, and thus to shorten the work, by turning the foamy into a hissing fermentation.\n\nFINERS of GOLD and SILVER, are those who purify and part those metals from other coarser ones by fire and acids.

He flourished in the third century; and according to the Irish histories died in the year 283, although there is some reason from Ossian's poems for placing his death a few years later. Fingal was descended in all probability from those Celtic tribes who were the first inhabitants of Britain. Tradition, and the poems of Ossian, give him a long line of royal ancestors, such as Combal, Tremor, Trathal, &c., who had all reigned over the same territory. Whether this territory was bounded by the Caledonian forest, or extended somewhat farther to the south, towards the Roman province, is uncertain; but there is no doubt of its having extended over all the north and west Highlands, comprehending the Hebrides, whose petty chiefs were all subject to the king of Morven. His principal place of residence was Selma, which was probably in the neighbourhood of Glenco, supposed to be the Cona of Ossian; though some imagine it to have been in Strath-Conan in Moray. The truth seems to be, that as Fingal and his people lived by hunting, they often shifted their habitations. Hence, in all parts of the Highlands we find, in the names of places, buildings, &c., such monuments as justify their several claims for the honour of Fingal's residence. Fingal acquired great fame by his prowess in arms. He made many successful incursions into the Roman province, from whence he carried away those spoils which his son so often mentions under the names of the wine of the stranger, and the wax of the stranger. By sea we find him frequently making voyages to Scandinavia, the Orkneys, and Ireland; called by Ossian Lochlin, Innisfiorr and Ullin. Several of these expeditions were celebrated by his son in epic poems, of which two only remain, Fingal and Temora. In the last of these poems, we find Fingal fighting together with his grandson Ossian. How long he lived afterwards is uncertain. He is said to have died a natural death; and therefore none of his son's poems relate to this event, though it is occasionally mentioned in many of them.\n\n\"Did thy beauty last, O Ryno? Stood the strength of car-borne Ossian? Fingal himself panted away; and the halls of his fathers have forgotten his steps. The blast of the north opens thy gates, O king, and I behold thee sitting on midst, dimly gleaming in all thine arms. Thy form now is not the terror of the valiant: but like a watery cloud, when we see the stars behind it, with their weeping eyes. Thy shield is like the aged moon; thy sword vapour half kindled with fire. Dim and feeble is the chief who travelled in brightness before. But thy steps are on the winds of the desert, and the storms darken in thy hand. Thou takest the sun in thy wrath, and hidest him in thy clouds. The sons of little men are afraid, and a thousand showers descend.\u2014Berrathon.\n\n\"The character of Fingal (Dr Blair observes) is perhaps the most perfect that ever was drawn by a poet, for we may boldly defy all the writers of antiquity to show us any hero equal to Fingal. Throughout the whole of Ossian's works, he is presented to us in all that variety of lights which give the full display of a character. In him concur almost all the qualities that can ennoble human nature; that can either make us admire the hero, or love the man. He is not only unconquerable in war, but he makes his people happy by his wisdom in the days of peace. He is truly the father of his people. He is known by the epithet of 'Fingal'...\"\nFingal. 'Fingal of the mildest look,' and distinguished on every occasion by humanity and generosity. He is merciful to his foes, full of affection to his children, full of concern about his friends, and never mentions Agandecca, his first love, without the utmost tenderness. He is the universal protector of the distressed; none ever went far from Fingal.\u2014'O Oicar! bend the strong in arms, but spare the feeble hand. Be thou a stream of many tides against the foes of thy people; but like the gale that moves the grass to those who ask thine aid: so Tremor lived; such Trathal was; and such has Fingal been. My arm was the support of the injured; the weak relied behind the lightning of my steel.' These were the maxims of true heroism, to which he formed his grandson. His fame is represented as everywhere spread; the greatest heroes acknowledge his superiority; his enemies tremble at his name; and the highest encomiums that can be bestowed on one whom the poet would most exalt, is to say, That his soul was like the soul of Fingal. Wherever he appears, we behold the hero. The objects he pursues are always great; to bend the proud, to protect the injured, to defend his friends, to overcome his enemies by generosity more than by force. Some strokes of human imperfection and frailty are what usually give us the most clear view and the most sensible impression of a character, because they present to us a man such as we have seen; they reveal known features of human nature. When poets go beyond this range, and attempt to describe a faultless hero, they, for the most part, let before us a sort of vague undistinguishable character, such as the imagination cannot lay hold of, or realize to itself as the object of affection. But Fingal, though exhibited without any of the common human failings, is nevertheless a real man; a character which touches and interests every reader.\"\n\nWe may observe, that Fingal appears to have been no less a poet than a warrior; at least, in all those passages ascribed to him in the poems of his son, there is a grandeur and loftiness that elevates them above the common style even of Ossian. The following passage from the poem of Garthon may be taken as a specimen of Fingal's poetry. \"\u2014Raife, ye bards,\" said the mighty Fingal, \"the praise of the unhappy Moina. Call her ghost, with your songs, to our hills; that she may rest with the fair of Morven, the sunbeams of other days, and the delight of heroes of old.\u2014I have seen the walls of Balclutha, but they were desolate. The fire had rekindled in the halls; and the voice of the people is heard no more. The stream of Clutha was removed from its place by the fall of the walls. The thistle shook there, its lonely head: the moos whistled to the wind. The fox looked out from the windows; the rank grass of the wall waved round his head. Desolate is the dwelling of Moina: silence is in the house of her fathers. Raise the song of mourning, O bards, over the land of strangers. They have but fallen before us; for, one day we must fall.\u2014Why dost thou build the hall, son of the winged days? Thou lookest from thy towers to-day; yet a few years, and the blast of the desert comes; it howls in thy empty court, and whirls round thy half-worn shield.\u2014And let the blast of the desert come! We shall be renowned in our day. The mark of my arm shall be in the battle, and my name in the song of bards. Raise the song; send round the shell; and let joy be heard in my hall. When thou, sun of heaven, shalt fail! if thou shalt fail, thou mighty light! if thy brightness is for a season, like Fingal; our fame shall survive thy beams.\" Such was the joy of Fingal in the day of his joy. His thousand bards leaned forward from their seats, to hear the voice of the king. It was like the music of the harp on the gale of the spring. Lovely were thy thoughts, O Fingal! Why had not Ossian the strength of thy soul? But thou standest alone, my father; and who can equal the king of Morven?\" See OSSIAN.","sp":252,"ep":253},{"h":"FINGERS","t":"in Anatomy, the extreme part of the hand divided into five members.

The Russians have for some time rendered themselves masters of a good part of this province; the rest belongs to Sweden. It is divided into seven provinces; 1. Finland; 2. Caja na; 3. Thavafithia; 4. Nyeland; 5. Savolaxia; 6. Car elia; and, 7. Kexholmia.\n\nFinland Proper is an agreeable country, and lies over-against the city of Stockholm, near the place where the gulfs of Bothnia and Finland meet. It is divided into South and North Finland. It is diversified with mountains, forests, lakes, meadows, and pleasant fields.

It seems likewise to be the chief agent in nature on which animal and vegetable life have an immediate dependence, and without which it does not appear that nature itself could subsist a single moment.\n\nThe disputes concerning fire, which for a long time divided,\ndivided philosophers, have now in a great measure, though not wholly, subsided. The celebrated philosophers of the last century, Bacon, Boyle, and Newton, were of opinion, that fire was no distinct substance from other bodies, but that it consisted entirely in the violent motion of the parts of any body. As no motion, however, can be produced without a cause, they were obliged to have recourse to a mechanical force or impulse as the ultimate cause of fire in all cases. Thus Boyle tells us, that when a piece of iron becomes hot by hammering, \"there is nothing to make it so, except the forcible motion of the hammer imprinting a vehement and variously determined agitation on the small parts of the iron.\" Bacon defines heat, which he makes synonymous with fire, to be \"an expansive undulatory motion in the minute particles of a body, whereby they tend with some rapidity from a centre towards a circumference, and at the same time a little upwards.\" Sir Isaac Newton did nothing positive upon the subject; but conjectured that grots bodies and light might be convertible into one another; and that great bodies of the size of our earth when violently heated, might continue and increase their heat by the mutual action and reaction of their parts.\n\nBut while the mechanical philosophers thus endeavoured to account for the phenomena of fire upon the same principles which they judged sufficient to explain those of the universe in general, the chemists as strenuously asserted that fire was a fluid of a certain kind, distinct from all others, and universally present throughout the whole globe. Boerhaave particularly maintained this doctrine; and in support of it brought the following argument, that steel and flint would strike fire, and produce the very same degree of heat, in Nova Zembla, which they would do under the equator. Other arguments were drawn from the increased weight of metallic calces, which they supposed to proceed from the fixing of the element of fire in the substance whose weight was thus increased. By these experiments Mr. Boyle himself seems to have been staggered; as he published a treatise on the possibility of making fire and flame ponderable; though this was directly contrary to his own principles already quoted. For a long time, however, the matter was most violently disputed; and the mechanical philosophers, though their arguments were equally inconclusive with those of their adversaries, at last prevailed through the prejudice in favour of Sir Isaac Newton, who indeed had scarce taken any active part in the contest.\n\nThat the cause of fire cannot be any mechanical motion which we can impel, is very evident; because on mechanical principles an effect must always be proportional to the cause. In the case of fire, however, the effect is beyond all calculation greater than the cause, supposing the latter to be only a mechanical percussion, as in the case of hammering iron till it be red hot. By a few strokes of a hammer, the particles of a piece of iron, we shall allow, may be set in a violent motion, and thus produce fire. If, however, we direct the motion of these particles upon another body whose parts are at rest, and in some degree coherent, it is plain that the latter will resist and diminish that motion of the particles already moved, in proportion to their vis inertiae, as well as the cohesion of the parts of the second body; if indeed we can suppose the vis\n\ninertiae of matter to be different from the effect of gravitation, cohesion, or some other power acting upon it. By no argumentation whatever, then, can we show upon mechanical principles, why fire should have such a tendency to increase and multiply itself without end, as we see it has, even abstracting from all consideration of the necessity of air for continuing the action of fire.\n\nThe action of the air in augmenting and continuing the power of fire, seems scarce at all to have been considered by those who first undertook an investigation of the subject. It evidently gave rise to the Hutchisonian hypothesis, that fire, light, and air, were convertible into one another. This, however, is equally untenable with the mechanical hypothesis; for later discoveries have shown, that our atmosphere is composed of two distinct fluids, only one of which is fit for supporting flame; and if we should suppose this to be the only proper air, it is in like manner demonstrated, that this pure fluid is not homogeneous, but composed of a gravitating and non-gravitating substance; the latter of which only has the properties of fire; so that this element is still as invisible as ever; nor can it be shown by any experiment that fire per se has ever been changed into a palpable or gravitating substance.\n\nThe experiments which first seemed to bring this dispute to a decision were those of Dr. Black, concerning what he called latent heat; on which some other names, such as absolute heat, specific fire, &c., have been bestowed, very little to the advancement of science in general. From these discoveries it appears, that fire may exist in bodies in such a manner as not to discover itself in any other way than by its action upon the minute parts of the body; but that suddenly this action may be changed in such a manner as no longer to be directed upon the particles of the body itself, but upon external objects; in which case we then perceive its action by our sense of feeling, or discover it by the thermometer, and call it sensible heat. This expression, it must be owned, is improper; and the use of the word heat, instead of fire, has produced some confusion, which it is not now easy to avoid in speaking on these subjects. By the word heat, we ought always to understand the effect of fire, or the fluid acting in a certain manner, rather than the mere element itself, which, it is certain, from the experiments just mentioned, may exist in substances actually cold to the touch.\n\nFrom this discovery made by Dr. Black, along with many others in electricity, and recorded at length in various articles of this work, it is now almost universally allowed, that fire is a distinct fluid, capable of being transferred from one body to another. But when this was discovered, another question no less perplexing occurred, viz. what kind of a fluid it was; or whether it bears any analogy to those with which we are better acquainted? Here we find two fluids, viz. the solar light, and the electric matter, both of which occasionally act as fire, and which therefore seem likely to be all the same at bottom. By the vulgar, indeed, the matter has long ago been determined; and the rays of the sun as well as the electrical fluid, have been promiscuously denominated elementary fire. Philosophers, indeed, have withheld their assent; though\ntheir reasons for so doing are by no means apparent.\n\nThe most strange suppositions, however, have been made concerning the nature of both those fluids; and on the most slender grounds imaginable, or rather, on no grounds at all, they have been supposed to be phlogiston itself, or to contain a large proportion of it. Mr Scheele went so far in this way as to form an hypothesis, which he endeavoured to support by some experiments, that fire is composed of dephlogisticated air and phlogiston. But it is now ascertained beyond all possibility of dispute that the result of such a combination is not fire, but fixed air; so that we need not take any farther notice of this hypothesis than just to observe, that it would have been altogether untenable, even though this discovery had not been made; because the dephlogisticated air itself is not a simple but a compound substance, as has already been observed; and that in all cases of combustion the one part of the air is separated from the other.\n\nIt was long ago observed by Sir Isaac Newton, that heat was certainly conveyed by a medium more subtle than the common air; because two thermometers, one included in the vacuum of an air pump, the other placed in the open air, at an equal distance from the fire, would grow equally hot in near the same time. The consequence of this, had he pursued the thought, was, that fire itself was equally present in all places, and as active where there was no terrestrial matter as where there was. New improvements in the air pump have enabled succeeding philosophers to make more perfect vacuums, such as it has been supposed even the electric matter cannot pass through. It is not to be doubted, however, that, even there, the thermometer would be heated by a fire as well as in the open air. Fire, therefore, exits and acts where there is no other matter, and of consequence is a fluid per se, independent of every terrestrial substance, without being generated or compounded of any thing we are yet acquainted with. To determine the nature of the fluid, we have only to consider whether any other can be discovered which will pass through the perfect vacuum just mentioned, and act there as fire. Such a fluid we find in the solar light, which is well known to act even in vacuo as the most violent fire. The solar light will likewise act in the very same manner in the most intense cold; for M. de Saussure has found, that on the cold mountain top the sunbeams are equally, nay more powerful, than on the plain below. It appears, therefore, that the solar light will produce heat independent of any other substance whatever; that is, where no other body is present, at least as far as we can judge, except the light itself and the body to be acted upon. We cannot therefore avoid concluding, that a certain modification of the light of the sun is the cause which produces heat, expansion, vapour, &c. and answers to the rest of the characters given in our definition of fire, and that independent of any other substance whatever.\n\nFor a further discussion of this subject, see Chemistry and Electricity Index.\n\nWild Fire, a kind of artificial or factious fire, which burns even under water, and that with greater violence than out of it.\n\nIt is composed of sulphur, naphtha, pitch, gum, and bitumen; and is only extinguishable by vinegar mixed with sand and urine, or by raw hides.\n\nVol. VIII. Part II.\n\nIts motion or tendency is said to be contrary to that of natural fire, and always follows the direction in which it is thrown; whether it be downwards, sideways, or otherwise. The French call it Greek fire, or Feu Grecques, because first used by the Greeks, about the year 660: as is observed by the Jesuit Petavius, on the authority of Nicetas, Theophanes, Cedrenus, &c.\n\nThe inventor, according to the same Jesuit, was an engineer of Heliopolis, in Syria, named Callinicus, who first applied it in the sea-fight commanded by Constantine Pogonates against the Saracens, near Cyzicus, in the Hellespont; and with such effect, that he burnt the whole fleet therewith wherein were 30,000 men. But others will have it of a much older date, and hold Marcus Graeculus the inventor: which opinion is supported by several passages both in the Greek and Roman writers, which shows it to have been anciently used by both these nations in their wars.\n\nConstantine's successors used it on divers occasions with equal advantage as himself: and what is remarkable enough is, that they were so happy as to keep the secret of the composition to themselves, so that no other nation knew it in the year 960.\n\nHugh king of Burgundy, demanding ships of the emperor Leo, for the siege of Fresne, desired likewise the Greek fire.\n\nF. Daniel gives a good description of the Greek fire, in his account of the siege of Damietta under St Louis. Every body, lays that author, was affrighted with the Greek fire, which the Turks then prepared; and the secret whereof is now lost. They threw it out of a kind of mortar; and sometimes shot it with an odd sort of cross-bow, which was strongly bent by means of a handle or winch, of much greater force than the mere arm. That thrown with the mortar sometimes appeared in the air of the size of a tun, with a long tail, and a noise like that of thunder. The French by degrees got the secret of extinguishing it, in which they succeeded several times.\n\nMachine for preserving from Fire. This machine consists of a pole, a rope, and a basket. The pole is of fir, or a common scaffold pole, of any convenient length from 36 to 46 feet; the diameter at bottom, or greatest end, about five inches; and at the top, or smallest end, about three inches. At three feet from the top is a mortise through the pole, and a pulley fixed to it of nearly the same diameter with the pole in that part. The rope is about three quarters of an inch diameter, and twice the length of the pole, with a spring hook at one end, to pass through the ring in the handle of the basket when used: it is put through the mortise over the pulley, and then drawn tight on each side to near the bottom of the pole, and made fast there till wanted. The basket should be of strong wicker-work, three feet and a half long, two feet and a half wide, rounded off at the corners, and four feet deep, rounding every way at the bottom. To the top of the basket is fixed a strong iron curve or handle, with an eye or ring in the middle; and to one side of the basket, near the top, is fixed a small cord or guide-rope of about the length of the pole. When the pole is raised, and set against a house over the window from which any persons are to escape, the manner of using it is so plain and obvious, that it needs not be described. The most convenient distance from the house for the foot\nof the pole to stand, where practicable, is about 12 or 14 feet. If two strong iron straps, about three feet long, rivetted to a bar across spreading about 14 inches at the foot, were fixed at the bottom of the pole, this would prevent its turning round or slipping on the pavement. And if a strong iron hoop, or ferrule, rivetted (or welded) to a semicircular piece of iron spreading about 12 inches, and pointed at the ends, were fixed on at the top of the pole, it would prevent its sliding against the wall.\n\nWhen these two last mentioned irons are fixed on, they give the pole all the steadiness of a ladder; and because it is not easy, except to persons who have been used to it, to raise and set upright a pole of 40 feet or more in length, it will be convenient to have two small poles or spars of about two inches diameter, fixed to the sides of the great pole at about two or three feet above the middle of it, by iron eyes rivetted to two plates so as to turn every way; the lower end of these spars to reach within a foot of the bottom of the great pole, and to have ferrules and short spikes to prevent sliding on the pavement, when used occasionally to support the great pole like a tripod. There should be two strong alli trundles let through the pole, one at four feet and one at five feet from the bottom, to stand out about eight inches on each side, and to serve as handles, or to twist the rope round in lowering a very heavy weight. If a block and pulley were fixed at about the middle of the rope, above the other pulley, and the other part of the rope made to run double, it would diminish any weight in the basket nearly one half, and be very useful in drawing any person up, to the affluence of those in the chambers, or for removing any effects out of a chamber, which it might be dangerous to attempt by the stairs.\n\nIt has been proved, by repeated trials, that such a pole as we have been speaking of can be raised from the ground, and two or three persons taken out of the upper windows of a house, and set down safely in the street, in the space of 35 seconds, or a little more than half a minute. Sick and infirm persons, women, children, and many others, who cannot make use of a ladder, may be safely and easily brought down from any of the windows of a house on fire by this machine, and, by putting a short pole through the handles of the basket, may be removed to any distance without being taken out of the basket. The pole must always have the rope ready fixed to it, and may be conveniently laid up upon two or three iron hooks under any shade or gateway, and the basket should be kept at the watch-house. When the pole is laid up, the two spars should always be turned towards the head of it. The basket should be made of peeled rods, and the pole and spars painted of a light stone colour, to render it more visible when used in the night.\n\nMachines for extinguishing Fire. In the year 1734, the state of Sweden offered a premium of 20,000 crowns for the best method of stopping the progress of accidental fires; when one Mr Fuches, a German physician, made a preparation for that end, and the experiment was made on a house built on purpose of dry fir, at Legard island. In the building were placed several tubs of tar and pitch, and a great quantity of chips, all which were set on fire; flames issuing through the top of the house, windows, &c., when he threw in one of the barrels containing the preparation, which immediately quenched the flames; a second barrel entirely cleared the smoke away; and the whole was executed to the satisfaction of the spectators, and to the no small satisfaction of the inventor, who was about to return home, when unexpectedly the flames broke out again, supposed to be occasioned by a small quantity of combustible matter being introduced and set on fire secretly by some malicious person. Upon this the wrong-headed mob fell upon Mr Fuches, and beat him most unmercifully, so that he narrowly escaped with his life. He soon after left the country, and never could be prevailed on (though strongly persuaded by some of the most eminent citizens) to return. It is said, another experiment of the same kind was tried in the year 1761 in Holland; but rendered abortive through the perseverance of the populace.\n\nAttempts of a similar nature have met with a better reception in England. Of these the most successful was that of Mr Godfrey, whose contrivance is thus described by Mr Ambrose Godfrey, grandson to the inventor:\n\n\"The machine to be employed consists of a small portion of gunpowder closely confined; which, when animated by fire, acts by its elastic force upon a proper medium, and not only divideth it into the minutest atoms, but disperseth it all in every direction, so as immediately to extinguish any fire within a certain distance. This medium is a liquor strongly impregnated with a preparation of antiphlogistic principles, which by their action upon burning materials extinguish the flames and reduce them in general to the state of a black coal; and, by its opposite nature to fire, hinders the remaining sparks, notwithstanding the admixture of the air, from kindling the flames afresh. By this means, the great point is obtained, in giving sufficient time for totally extinguishing any remains of fire.\n\n\"They who presume that water only will perform this will find themselves greatly mistaken, as the draught of air will certainly rekindle the neighbouring materials, which are very fit to receive a fresh flame, the fire not being extinguished by the quantity of water, but rather by the expansion and rarefaction of its particles. There are several sizes of these machines, from five to fifty pounds weight, in a portable and rather small compass, and may generally be carried to any place where a man can go himself.\n\n\"But though these machines will prevent great fires by a timely application, they will not extinguish them after they have reached a frightful height, and several houses, perhaps near a whole street, are in flames. The floors must be standing, and access to the building safe, otherwise no person can be supposed to approach near enough to apply them in a proper manner. Every fire has its beginning for the most part in some apartment; and, as soon as discovered, the family, instead of losing all presence of mind, should immediately apply one or more of these machines, which will then fully answer the intention. The proper time of applying them, supposes that they are ready at hand. It will be in vain to think of fetching them from any considerable distance, as it will then be too late for them to perform any important service: except indeed being the probable means of saving some adjacent house, by extinguishing\ntinguishing the flames as often as they break out, till the building first on fire is totally consumed, and, by falling into ruins, leaves the other in perfect safety.\"\n\nOn the 19th of May 1761, at noon, Mr Godfrey's experiment for extinguishing fire, was tried in a house erected for that purpose, near Mary-le-bone. Their royal highnesses, the duke of York, Prince William Henry, Prince Henry Frederick, a great number of persons of rank and distinction, and many of the learned world, gave their attendance on this singular occasion. The house, which was of brick, consisted of three rooms one above another, a staircase, chimney, lath and plaster ceilings, and a kind of wainscoting round the rooms, of rough deal. Exactly at 12 o'clock the ground room, and that up one pair of stairs, were set on fire by lighting the faggots and shavings laid in there for that purpose: in about 15 minutes the wainscot of the under room was thought to be sufficiently in flames, and three of the machines were thrown in; which, by almost immediate and sudden explosions, instantaneously extinguished the flames, and the very smoke in that apartment in a few minutes totally disappeared. By this time, the firemen, &c. who had the care of throwing in the machines, gave an alarm that the fireplace had taken fire, and that it was necessary directly to go to work upon the next room; which was accordingly done, and with the same effect. The experiment, however, hitherto did not universally satisfy: in the last instance especially it was thought to be too hastily put in execution; and the populace without side the paling, who were supposed to amount to near 20,000, and whose curiosity, from the very nature of their situation, remained much dissatisfied, began to grow rather riotous, and talked of a second bottle conjuror. For the sake of the experiment, therefore, and to remove all manner of doubt, Mr Godfrey consented to a third experiment in the upper room, which was entirely of wood. The flames were now suffered to get to a considerable height, and even the window frames destroyed, before the machines were thrown in: which, however, answered exactly as the former had done; and, being quite in sight of the out-standers, met with universal approbation.\n\nThese machines of Mr Godfrey's, it is evident, would be of great use in extinguishing fires on shipboard; and might be considered as a no less necessary part of a ship's lading, than her stores or ammunition.\n\nThe hint of these machines is said to have been taken by Dr Godfrey from the invention of one Zachary Grey, who exhibited machines similar to those of Dr Godfrey, before persons of the first rank, but without meeting with any encouragement. His machines were made of wood, and the liquor employed was only water, and consequently inferior to Dr Godfrey's in its power of extinguishing fire. The latter is said to have mixed his water with a certain quantity of oil of vitriol, or with sal ammoniac. These machines, however, as already observed, are found to be only serviceable in the beginning of a fire. When the roof had fallen in, they had no effect.\n\nComposition for extinguishing Fire. For this purpose the following has been invented by M. Von Aken, of which the account is taken from Nicholson's Journal, vol. ii. 4to.\n\nBurnt alum 30 lbs.\nGreen vitriol powdered 40\nCinabrefe or red ochre in powder 20\nPotter's clay, or other clay, also powdered 200\nWater 630\n\nWith 40 measures of this mixture an artificial fire was extinguished under the direction of the inventor by three persons, which would have required the labour of 20 men and 1500 measures of common water. Sig. Fabbroni was commissioned to examine the value of this invention, and found in his comparative trials with engines of equal power, worked by the same number of men, that the mixture extinguished the materials in combustion in one-sixth part less time, and three-eighths less of fluid, than when common water was used. He observed, as might indeed have been imagined from the nature of the material, that the flame disappeared wherever the mixture fell, and that the saline, metallic, and earthy matters formed an impenetrable layer round the hot combustible matter, which prevented the access of the air, and consequently the renewal of the destructive process.\n\nIt is scarcely probable that this practice in the large way, with an engine throwing upwards of 200 gallons (value about \u00a31. 10s.) each minute, would be thought of or adopted, or that a sufficient store of the materials would be kept in readiness; since at this rate the expenditure for an hour would demand a provision to the amount of \u00a310l. sterling. But in country places the process, or some variation of it, might be applied with sufficient profit in the result; more especially if it be considered that common salt or alum, or such saline matter as can be had and mixed with the water, together with clay, chalk, or lime, ochreous earth or common mud, or even these last without any salt, may answer the purpose of the late with more or less effect, and extinguish an accidental fire with much greater speed and certainty than clear water would do.\n\nWater-Engine for Extinguishing Fire. See Hydrostatics.\n\nIn using this machine we have the following improvement by Dr Hoffman, which promises to be of great efficacy. As soon as the engine is in readiness to work, stir into the water that immediately is to be discharged, seven or eight pounds of pearl ashes in powder, and continue to add it in this manner as occasion requires; taking care that it be directed against the timber or wainscot, &c. just beginning to burn, and not waited against the brick-work: or, where time will admit, dissolve any quantity of pearl ashes in a copper with water, and as fast as it dissolves, which will be in a few minutes, mix a palpit with the water in the engine, pretty often; and whatever burning wood it is played upon, will be extinguished as if it was dipped in water, and will not burn afresh in the part extinguished.\n\nEasy Method of Extinguishing Fire in Chimneys. It is well known, that the inner parts of chimneys easily take fire; the foot that kindles therein emits a greater flame, according as the tunnel is more elevated, because the inferior air feeds the fire. If this air could therefore be suppressed, the fire would soon be extinguished. In order to this, some discharge a pitfall into the chimney, which produces no effect; others lay...\nunder the chimney a copper full of water; but the vapours that rise from it, far from extinguishing the fire, seem to give it new force. Water thrown into the chimney at top is equally of no effect, because it comes down through the middle of the tunnel, and not along the sides. It would be more advisable to stop with dung the upper orifices of the tunnel for quenching the fire. But the surest and readiest method is, to take a little gunpowder, and having humected it with spititle for binding it, to form it into small masses, and so throw it into the heart of the chimney. When it is burnt, and has produced a considerable vapour, a second, afterwards a third, are thrown, and so on, as much as is necessary. In a little time the fire is extinguished, and, as it were, choked by this vapour; and cakes of inflamed foot are seen to fall from the tunnel, till at last not the least vestige of fire appears.\n\nSecuring Buildings against Fire. Dr Hales proposes to check the progress of fires by covering the floors of the adjoining houses with earth. The proposal is founded on an experiment which he made with a fir board half an inch thick, part of which he covered with an inch depth of damp garden mould, and then lighted a fire on the surface of the mould; though the fire was kept up by blowing, it was two hours before the board was burnt through, and the earth prevented it from flaming. The thicker the earth is laid on the floors, the better; however, Dr Hales apprehends that the depth of an inch will generally be sufficient; and he recommends to lay a deeper covering on the stairs, because the fire commonly ascends by them with the greatest velocity.\n\nMr Hartley made several trials in the years 1775 and 1776, in order to evince the efficacy of a method which he had invented for restraining the spread of fire in buildings. For this purpose thin iron plates are well nailed to the tops of the joists, &c., the edges of the sides and ends being lapped over, folded together, and hammered close. Partitions, stairs, and floors, may be defended in the same manner; and plates applied to one side have been found sufficient. The plates are so thin as not to prevent the floor from being nailed on the joists, in the same manner as if this preventive were not used: they are kept from rust by being painted or varnished with oil and turpentine. The expense of this addition, when extending through a whole building, is estimated at about five per cent. Mr Hartley has a patent for this invention, and parliament has voted a sum of money towards defraying the expense of his numerous experiments. The same preservative may also be applied to ships, furniture, &c.\n\nLord Mahon has also discovered and published a very simple and effectual method of securing every kind of building against all danger of fire. This method he has divided into three parts, viz. under-flooring, extra-lathing, and inter-securing.\n\nThe method of under-flooring is either single or double. In single under-flooring, a common strong lath of oak or fir, about one-fourth of an inch thick, should be nailed against each side of every joist, and of every main timber, supporting the floor which is to be secured. Other similar laths are then to be nailed along the whole length of the joists, with their ends butting against each other. The top of each of these laths or fillets ought to be at 1\u00bd inch below the top of the joists or timbers against which they are nailed; and they will thus form a sort of small ledge on each side of all the joists. These fillets are to be well bedded in a rough plaster hereafter mentioned, when they are nailed on, so that there may be no interval between them and the joists; and the same plaster ought to be spread with a trowel upon the tops of all the fillets, and along the sides of that part of the joists which is between the top of the fillets and the upper edge of the joists. In order to fill up the intervals between the joists that support the floor, short pieces of common laths, whose length is equal to the width of these intervals, should be laid in the contrary direction to the joists, and close together in a row, so as to touch one another: their ends must rest upon the fillets, and they ought to be well bedded in the rough plaster, but are not to be fastened with nails. They must then be covered with one thick coat of the rough plaster, which is to be spread over them to the level of the tops of the joists; and in a day or two this plaster should be trowelled over close to the sides of the joists, without covering the tops of the joists with it.\n\nIn the method of double flooring, the fillets and short pieces of laths are applied in the manner already described; but the coat of rough plaster ought to be little more than half as thick as that in the former method. Whilst this rough plaster is laid on, some more of the short pieces of laths above mentioned must be laid in the intervals between the joists upon the first coat, and be dipped deep in it. They should be laid as close as possible to each other, and in the same direction with the first layer of short laths. Over this second layer of short laths there must be spread another coat of rough plaster, which should be trowelled level with the tops of the joists without rising above them. The rough plaster may be made of coarse lime and hair; or, instead of hair, hay chopped to about three inches in length may be substituted with advantage. One measure of common rough sand, two measures of flaked lime, and three measures of chopped hay, will form in general a very good proportion, when sufficiently beat up together in the manner of common mortar. The hay should be put in after the two other ingredients are well beat up together with water. This plaster should be made stiff; and when the flooring boards are required to be laid down very soon, a fourth or fifth part of quicklime in powder, formed by dropping a small quantity of water on the limestone a little while before it is used, and well mixed with this rough plaster, will cause it to dry very fast. If any cracks appear in the rough plaster work near the joists when it is thoroughly dry, they ought to be closed by washing them over with a brush wet with mortar wash: this wash may be prepared by putting two measures of quicklime and one of common sand in a pail, and stirring the mixture with water till it becomes of the consistence of a thin jelly.\n\nBefore the flooring boards are laid, a small quantity of very dry common sand should be strewn over the plaster work, and struck smooth with a hollow rule, moved in the direction of the joists, so that it may lie rounding between each pair of joists. The plaster work and sand should be perfectly dry before the boards are laid, for fear of the dry rot. The method\nof under-flooring may be successfully applied to a wooden staircase; but no sand is to be laid upon the rough plaster work. The method of extra-lathing may be applied to ceiling joists, to sloping roofs, and to wooden partitions.\n\nThe third method, which is that of inter-securing, is very similar to that of under-flooring; but no sand is afterwards to be laid upon it. Inter-securing is applicable to the same parts of a building as the method of extra-lathing, but it is seldom necessary.\n\nLord Mahon has made several experiments in order to demonstrate the efficacy of these methods. In most houses it is only necessary to secure the floors; and the extra expense of under-flooring, including all materials, is only about ninepence per square yard, and with the use of quicklime a little more. The extra expense of extra-lathing is no more than sixpence per square yard for the timber side walls and partitions; but for the ceiling about ninepence per square yard. But in most houses no extra lathing is necessary.\n\n**Fire-Eater.** We have a great number of mountebanks who have procured the attention and wonder of the public by eating fire, walking on fire, washing their hands in melted lead, and the like tricks.\n\nThe most celebrated of these was our countryman Richardson, much talked of abroad. His secret, as related in the *Journal des Scavans*, of the year 1682, consisted in a pure spirit of sulphur, wherewith he rubbed his hands, and the parts that were to touch the fire; which burning and cauterizing the epidermis, hardened and enabled the skin to resist the fire.\n\nIndeed this is no new thing: Amb. Pare\u00e9 assures us he has tried it on himself; that after washing the hands in urine, and with unguentum aureum, one may safely wash them in melted lead.\n\nHe adds also, that by washing his hands in the juice of onions, he could bear a hot shovel on them while it melted lead.\n\n**Fire, in Theology.** See Hell.\n\nWe read of the sacred fire in the first temple of Jerusalem, which came down from heaven; it was kept with the utmost care, and they were forbidden to carry any strange fire into the temple. This fire is one of the five things which the Jews confess were wanting in the second temple.\n\nThe Pagans had their sacred fires, which they kept in their temples with the most religious care, and which were never to be extinguished. Numa was the first who built a temple to Fire as a goddess at Rome, and instituted an order of priestesses for the preservation of it. See Vestals.\n\nFire was the supreme god of the Chaldeans; the Magi were worshippers of fire; and the Greeks and Armenians still keep up a ceremony called the holy fire, upon a persuasion that every Easter day a miraculous fire descends from heaven into the holy sepulchre, and kindles all the lamps and candles there.\n\n**Fire kindled spontaneously in the Human Body.** See Extraordinary Cases of Burning.\n\n**Fire-Barrel.** See Fire-Ship, Note (B).\n\n**Fire-Bowins.** Ibid. Note (D).\n\n**Fire Arrow,** in naval artillery, is a small iron dart furnished with springs and bars, together with a match impregnated with sulphur and powder, which is wound about its shaft. It is intended to fire the sails of the enemy, and is for this purpose discharged from a musketoon or swivel gun. The match being kindled by the explosion, communicates the flame to the sail against which it is directed, where the arrow is fastened by means of its bars and springs. This weapon is peculiar to hot climates, particularly the West Indies, where the sails being extremely dry by reason of the great heat, they instantly take fire, and of course set fire to the masts and rigging, and lastly to the vessel itself.\n\n**Fire-Ball,** in artillery, a composition of meal powder, sulphur, saltpetre, pitch, &c. about the bigness of a hand grenade, coated over with flax, and primed with the flow composition of a fuze. This is to be thrown into the enemy's works in the night time, to discover where they are, or to fire housetops, galleries, or blinds of the besiegers; but they are then armed with spikes, or hooks of iron, that they may not roll off, but stick or hang where they are desired to have any effect. See Fire-Balls, and Light-Balls.\n\n**Balls of Fire,** in Meteorology, a kind of luminous bodies generally appearing at a great height above the earth, with a splendour surpassing that of the moon; and sometimes equalling her apparent size. They generally proceed in this hemisphere from north to south with vast velocity, frequently breaking into several smaller ones, sometimes vanishing with a report, sometimes not.\n\nThese luminous appearances no doubt constitute one part of the ancient prodigies, blazing stars or comets, which last they sometimes resemble in being attended with a train; but frequently they appear with a round and well-defined disk. The first of these of which we have any accurate account, was observed by Dr Halley and some other philosophers at different places, in the year 1719. From the flight observations they could take of its course among the stars, the perpendicular height of this body was computed at about 70 miles from the surface of the earth. The height of others has also been computed, and found to be various; though in general it is supposed to be beyond the limits assigned to our atmosphere, or where it loses its refractive power. The most remarkable of these on record appeared on the 18th of August 1783, about nine o'clock in the evening. It was seen to the northward of Shetland, and took a southerly direction for an immense space, being observed as far as the southern provinces of France, and one account says that it was seen at Rome also. During its course it appears frequently to have changed its shape; sometimes appearing in the form of one ball, sometimes of two or more; sometimes with a train, sometimes without one. It passed over Edinburgh nearly in the zenith, and had then the appearance of a well-defined round body, extremely luminous, and of a greenish colour; the light which it diffused on the ground giving likewise a greenish cast to objects. After passing the zenith it was attended by a train of considerable length, which continually augmenting, at last obliterated the head entirely; so that it looked like a wedge, flying with the obtuse end foremost. The motion was not apparently swift, by reason of its great height; though in reality it must have moved with great rapidity, on account of the vast space it travelled over in a short time. In other places its appearance\npearance was very different. At Greenwich we are told, that \"two bright balls parallel to each other led the way, the diameter of which appeared to be about two feet; and were followed by an expulsion of eight others, not elliptical, seeming gradually to mutilate, for the last was small. Between each two balls a luminous serrated body extended, and at the last a blaze issued which terminated in a point. Minute particles dilated from the whole. The balls were tinted first by a pure bright light, then followed a tender yellow, mixed with azure, red, green, &c.; which, with a coalition of bolder tints, and a reflection from the other balls, gave the most beautiful rotundity and variation of colours that the human eye could be charmed with. The sudden illumination of the atmosphere, and the form and singular transition of this bright luminary, tended much to make it awful: nevertheless, the amazing vivid appearance of the different balls, and other rich connective parts not very easy to delineate, gave an effect equal to the rainbow in the full zenith of its glory.\"\n\nDr Blagden, in a paper on this subject in the 74th volume of the Philosophical Transactions, has not only given a particular account of this and other meteors of the kind, but added several conjectures relating to the probable causes of them. The first thing which occurred to philosophers on this subject was, that the meteors in question were burning bodies rising from the surface of the earth, and flying along the atmosphere with great rapidity. But this hypothesis was soon abandoned, on considering that there was no power known by which such bodies could either be raised to a sufficient height, or projected with the velocity of the meteors. The next hypothesis was, that they do not consist of one single body, but of a train of sulphurous vapours, extending a vast way through the atmosphere, and being kindled at one time display the luminous appearances in question by the fire running from one end of the train to the other. To this hypothesis, which was invented by Dr Halley, Dr Blagden objects that no just explanation is given of the nature of the vapours themselves, the manner in which they are raised up, or in which they can be regularly arranged in straight lines of such vast extent; or how they can be supposed to burn in such rarefied air. \"Indeed, (says he) it is very difficult to conceive how vapours could be prevented, in those regions where there is in a manner no pressure, from spreading out on all sides in consequence of their natural elasticity, and instantly losing that degree of density which seems necessary for inflammation. Besides, it is to be expected, that such trains would sometimes take fire in the middle, and thus present the phenomenon of two meteors at the same time, receding from one another in a direct line.\"\n\nFor these and other reasons this hypothesis of Dr Halley was abandoned, and another substituted in its place. This was, that the meteors we speak of are permanent solid bodies, not rising from the earth, but revolving round it in very eccentric orbits, and thus in their perigee moving with inconceivable rapidity. But the doctor shows, that even on this supposition, the velocity of such bodies must scarce be one third of that with which fire-balls move, and which has been calculated at upwards of 1000 miles per minute. The hypothesis is likewise liable to a number of other objections which cannot be answered, particularly from the variations in their appearance; for it is impossible to show in what manner one solid and permanent body could assume the appearance of eight or ten, as was the case with the meteor of 1783: nor can it be shown why a body, which in passing over Edinburgh appeared with a disk evidently less than that of the sun, should, in passing over Greenwich, assume the appearance of two bodies, each of which had a disk considerably larger than the apparent disk of that luminary. To obviate, in some measure, objections of this kind, it has been supposed that the revolving bodies are surrounded by a kind of electrical atmosphere by which they are rendered luminous; \"but (says the doctor) I think, whoever carefully peruses the various accounts of fire-balls, and especially ours of the 18th of August, when it divided, will perceive that their phenomena do not correspond with the idea of a solid nucleus involved in a subtile fluid, any more than with the idea of another learned gentleman, that they become luminous by means of a contained fluid, which occasionally explodes through the thick solid outer shell.\"\n\nAnother hypothesis, which Dr Blagden has not mentioned, is, that the meteors in question are a kind of bodies which take fire as soon as they come within the atmosphere of the earth. But this cannot be supposed, without implying a previous knowledge of these bodies, which it is altogether impossible we can have. The only opportunity we have of seeing them is when they are on fire. Before that time they are in an invisible and unknown state; and it is surely improper to argue concerning them in this state, or pretend to determine any one of their properties, when we have it not in our power to see or investigate them in the least. As the meteors therefore never manifest themselves to our senses but when they are on fire, the only rational conclusion we can draw from thence is, that they have no existence in any other state; and consequently that their substance must be composed of that fluid which, when acting after a certain manner, becomes luminous and shows itself as fire; remaining invisible and eluding our researches in every other case. On this hypothesis we must conclude that the fire-balls are great bodies of electric matter, moving from one part of the heavens where, to our conception, it is superabundant, to another where it is deficient. This opinion is adopted by Dr Blagden for the following reasons:\n\n1. On account of their prodigious velocity, which is not less than 1200 miles in a minute, and seems incompatible with any other substance we know besides the electric fluid. \"This (says he) is perhaps the only case in which the course or direction of that fluid is rendered perceptible to our senses, in consequence of the large scale on which these meteors move.\"\n\n2. Various electrical phenomena have been observed to attend them, such as lambent fires settling upon men, horses, &c., and sparks coming from them, \"or the whole meteor itself (adds our author), it is said, have damaged ships, houses, &c., after the manner of lightning.\" This last circumstance, however, we can believe only of another kind of fire-balls, of which we shall afterwards treat, which keep at a small distance from the earth, or run along its surface; for the great meteors\nmeteors of which we now speak, flying at the distance of 50 or 60, or more, miles from the surface of the earth, cannot be less than their apparent size than a mile or a mile and a half in diameter. Such an immense body of electric matter descending on the earth, would by its explosion ruin a large tract of country; and there is no probability that when engendered in such a rare atmosphere it could break through the whole body of gases and dense air which lies between these regions and the earth, and which we know resists the passage of the electric fluid very strongly. Notwithstanding this, there is no impossibility that the atmosphere may be electrified to a great degree by such a meteor passing over it; and thus electrified appearances may attend these bodies without any actual emission of their substance, as Dr Blagden supposes. \"If there be really (says he) any hissing noise heard while the meteors are passing, it seems explicable on no other supposition than that of streams of electric matter issuing from them, and reaching the earth with a velocity equal to that of the meteor, namely, in two or three seconds. Accordingly, in one of our late meteors, the hissing was compared to that of electricity issuing from a conductor. The sparks flying off so perpetually from the body of fire-balls may possibly have some connexion with these streams. In the same manner the sound of explosions may perhaps be brought to us quicker than if it were propagated to us by the air alone. Should these ideas be well founded, the change of direction, which meteors seem at times to undergo, may possibly be influenced by the state of the surface of the earth over which they are passing, and to which the streams are supposed to reach. A similar cause may occasion the apparent explosion, the opening of more channels giving new vent and motion to the electric fluid. May not the deviation and explosion which appear to have taken place in the fire-ball of the 18th of August over Lincolnshire, have been determined by its approach towards the fens, and an attraction produced by that large body of moisture?\n\nThe explosion mentioned by our author over Lincolnshire does not seem to have been the only one which happened during the course of this meteor. Several people heard reports after it had vanished; and these were sometimes single and sometimes double. At Edinburgh two reports were heard, the one immediately following the other, at the distance of six or seven minutes after the meteor had passed. These reports no doubt indicated a temporary dilution of the body; but it is by no means probable that the dilution could have taken place either on account of the state of the earth or atmosphere. We must consider that both earth and atmosphere are always full of electric fluid; and if there happens to be what is called a deficiency in one of them, the other instantly supplies it. It is impossible, therefore, that either the earth or atmosphere could receive such an immense additional quantity in one part without a vent being provided for it somewhere else. In thunderstorms we naturally conclude that a vast quantity of electrical matter is put in motion; but from the effects of lightning it appears that this quantity must be very trifling in comparison with what the meteor we now speak of contained. A violent flash of lightning has been known to perforate a looking-glass, and make only a hole of about an inch diameter. Now we have no reason to suppose that the flash, tremendous as it might appear to our eyes, was any other than an electric spark of an inch in diameter. The meteor, on the other hand, appears not to have been less than a mile in diameter; so that the disproportion between it and a single flash of lightning appears almost beyond calculation; and we may reasonably conclude that it could not have been equalled by 10,000 thunder-storms. Had this amazing body of electric fire descended through the atmosphere and dissipated itself on the fens of Lincolnshire, it must have produced the most violent and unheard-of effects, not only in that place, but probably throughout the whole island. Its dissipation must therefore have been in the higher regions, where there was ample space to receive it; and where its explosion, whatever conclusion it might make among the ethereal matter itself, could not affect our earth or atmosphere in any remarkable degree. Its re-appearance was owing to the same tendency in the fluid to circulate which had originally produced it; and which probably was the violent earthquake in Calabria, and the eruption in Iceland.\n\n3. Another argument adduced by Dr Blagden in favour of the electrical origin of fire-balls, is their connexion with the aurora borealis, and the resemblance they bear to these phenomena, which are now almost universally allowed to be electrical. \"Instances (says he) are recorded, where northern lights have been seen to join, and form luminous balls, darting about with great velocity, and even leaving a trail behind them like the common fire-balls. This train I take to be nothing else but the rarefied air left in such an electrified state as to be luminous; and some streams of the northern lights are very much like it.\" The aurora borealis appears to occupy as high, if not a higher region above the surface of the earth, as may be judged from the very distant countries to which it has been visible at the same time: indeed the great accumulation of electric matter seems to lie beyond the verge of our atmosphere, as estimated by the cessation of twilight. Also with the northern lights a hissing noise is said to be heard in some very cold climates; Gmelin speaks of it in the most pointed terms, as frequent and very loud in the north-eastern parts of Siberia; and other travellers have related similar facts.\"\n\n4. Our author thinks that the strongest argument for the electrical origin of these meteors is the direction of their course, which is constantly either from the north or north-west quarter of the heavens, or towards it; or, as our author thinks, nearly in the direction of the magnetic meridian. Such a course, however, seems only to belong to the very large fire-balls of which we now speak; the smaller ones, called Falling Stars, being moved in all directions; \"perhaps (says the doctor), because they come further within the verge of our atmosphere, and are thereby exposed to the action of extraneous causes. That the smaller sort of meteors, such as shooting stars, are really lower down in the atmosphere, is rendered very probable by their swifter apparent motion; perhaps it is this very circumstance which occasions them to be smaller, the electric fluid being more divided in more resisting air. But as those masses of electric matter which move\nwhere there is scarce any resistance, so generally affect the direction of the magnetic meridian, the ideas which have been entertained of some analogy between these two obscure powers of nature seem not altogether without foundation. If the foregoing conjectures be just, distinct regions are allotted to the electrical phenomena of our atmosphere. Here below we have thunder and lightning, from the unequal distribution of the electric fluid among the clouds; in the loftier regions, whither the clouds never reach, we have the various gradations of falling flares; till, beyond the limits of our corporeal atmosphere, the fluid is put into motion in sufficient masses, to hold a determined course, and exhibit the different appearances of what we call fire-balls; and probably at a still greater elevation above the earth, the electricity accumulates in a lighter and less condensed form, to produce the wonderfully diversified streams and coruscations of the aurora borealis.\"\n\nThe paper from whence these extracts are taken was written before Mr Morgan's account of the non-conducting power of a perfect vacuum made its appearance. The meteor in question, and others of the same nature, afford a proof of the theory of the deficiency of electric fluid proposed by some. Dr Halley, speaking of the fire-ball of 1719, the height of which he calculated at very little less than 70 miles, expresses his surprise that found should be propagated through a medium near 300,000 times rarer than the common air, and the next thing to a perfect vacuum. Now it remains, and for ever will remain, to be proved, that Mr Morgan's most perfect vacuum, formed by boiling quicksilver in a tube ever so long, contains a medium more than 300,000 times rarer than the common atmosphere.\n\nFrom Mr Cavallo's experiments it appears, that when air is only rarefied 1000 times, the electric light is excessively weak; so that there is not the least probability that in an aerial medium 300,000 times rarer than the present, if indeed such a medium can exist, there could be any light made visible in the ordinary experiments. We see, however, by the many examples of meteors which have occurred at prodigious heights in the atmosphere, that the electric light in such a rarefied atmosphere is not only visible, but acts as vigorously in every respect as if it were on the surface of the earth. This circumstance therefore affords a complete demonstration of the fallacy of Mr Morgan's argument, and a direct proof that the electric fluid pervades space as completely divested of air as the best artificial vacuum we can make; nay, where it is generally believed by mathematicians that the atmosphere has ceased altogether. His other arguments drawn a priori are still more inconclusive than that we have just mentioned. He tells us, that if a vacuum was a conductor, the whole quantity of electric matter contained in the earth and atmosphere would be perpetually flying off through the regions of infinite space, as being surrounded by a boundless conductor. But even this does not follow, though we should suppose these regions to be an absolute vacuum; for we know that electricity does not fly to a conducting substance merely because it is a conductor, but because it opens a passage to some place whither it has a tendency to go though the conductor was not there. Now, on the present hypothesis, as the conductor would lead to no place to which the electric matter had any previous tendency, we cannot assign any reason why it should acquire a tendency to fly off merely on account of the neighbourhood of a conductor, even though boundless.\n\nHis other objection (that, on the supposition of a vacuum being capable of conducting electricity, the whole space in the universe would be filled with electric fluid) may be admitted in its fullest extent, without any detriment whatever to science; and indeed, if we allow the electric fluid to be only a modification of the light of the sun, we must own that the whole universe is filled with it. The meteors in question then will be no other than discharges of electricity from one part of the celestial spaces to another, similar to the discharges between the positive and negative side of an electrified bottle; thus intimating, that a circulation has taken place in the fluid, which the meteor at once completes and puts an end to. See Meteorology.\n\nBesides these already just mentioned of such vast magnitude, there are others much smaller and nearer the surface of the earth, rolling upon it, or falling upon it, exploding with violence, as is the case with those which appear in the time of thunder, and frequently produce mischievous effects. One of these is mentioned by some authors as falling in a serene evening in the island of Jamaica; exploding as soon as it touched the surface of the ground, and making a considerable hole in it. Another is mentioned by Dr Priestley as rolling along the surface of the sea, then rising and striking the top-mast of a man of war, exploding, and damaging the ship. In like manner, we hear of an electrified cloud at Java in the East Indies; whence, without any thunder storm, there issued a vast number of fire-balls which did incredible mischief. This last phenomenon points out to us the true origin of balls of this kind, viz., an excessive accumulation of electricity in one part, or a violent tendency to circulate, when at the same time the place where the motion begins is at so great a distance, or meets with other obstacles of such a nature, that it cannot easily get thither. Urged on, however, by the vehement pressure from behind, it is forced to leave its place; but being equally unable to displace the great quantity of the same fluid, which has no inclination to move the same way with itself, it is collected into balls, which run hither and thither, according as they meet with conductors capable of leading them, into some part of the circle. This is even confirmed by an experiment related at the end of Dr Priestley's fifth volume on Air. He relates, that a gentleman having charged, with a very powerful machine, a jar, which had the wire supporting the knob of a considerable length, and passed through the glass tube, a globe of fire was seen to issue out of it. This globe gradually ascended up the glass tube till it came to the top of the knob, where it settled, turning swiftly on its axis, and appearing like a red-hot iron ball of three quarters of an inch diameter. On continuing to turn the machine, it gradually descended into the jar; which it had no sooner done, than there ensued a most violent explosion and flash, the jar being discharged and broken at the same time. This experiment, however, is singular in its kind; for neither the gentleman who performed it, nor any other, has yet been able to repeat it. Single as it is, however, we may yet gather from it, that a fire-ball will be the consequence of a very\nvery violent electrification of any substance, provided at the same time that the air be in a very non-conducting state, so that the electricity may not evaporate into it as fast as it is collected; for this would produce only lucid streams and flashes, as in the common experiments with the Leyden phial; and it is probably an inattention to this circumstance which has hitherto prevented the repetition of the experiment above mentioned. The case is the same in thunder storms, where an excessive accumulation of electric matter always produces fire-balls, the most mischievous kind of lightning, as is explained under that article.\n\nWith regard to the uses which fire-balls serve in the system of nature, it is plain that they are the means of preserving the equilibrium in the electric fluid in the atmosphere, which would otherwise produce the most dreadful tempests. As there must be a constant current of electric matter through the bowels of the earth from the equator to the poles, and from the poles to the equator, through the atmosphere, the great meteors serve for keeping up the equilibrium in this great atmospheric current, while the smaller ones answer a like purpose in the general mass of electric matter dispersed over the surface of the earth, and therefore are seen to move in all directions, as the equilibrium happens to require them in different parts. With regard to those which are observed in the lower regions of the earth, or rolling on the surface of the ground itself, they undoubtedly answer purposes of a similar kind in these lower regions; for as fire-balls in general are produced by a great excess of electricity in one place, there must of course be an equal deficiency in another; and to restore the equilibrium, or, to speak more properly, to prevent a dangerous commotion from taking place throughout the whole mass of electric fluid, the fire-ball breaks forth, and either puts a stop at once to the disturbance by an explosion, or by a silent and invisible evaporation. From some accounts indeed it would seem that even the large celestial meteors detached part of their substance to accomplish this purpose; though, for the reasons already given, it would seem more probable that they operated by electrifying the atmosphere, or setting the fluid contained in it in motion, so as to produce small fire-balls of itself, rather than by detaching any part of their own bodies to such a distance. Dr Blagden, in the paper above quoted, gives an account of an appearance of this kind. It was described in a letter to Sir Joseph Banks from the Abb\u00e9 Mann, director of the academy at Brussels. \"It happened (says the Abb\u00e9) at Marienkirche, a small village on the coast, about half a mile west of Ostend. The curate of the village was sitting in the dark of the evening with a friend, when a sudden light surprised them, and, immediately after, a small ball of light-colored flame came through a broken pane of glass, crossed the room where they were sitting, and fixed itself on the chink of a door opposite to the window where it entered, and there died gradually away. It appeared to be a kind of phosphoric light carried along by the current of air. The curate and his friend, greatly surprised at what they saw, apprehended fire in the neighborhood; but going out, found that the fire which had come in through the window had been detached from a large meteor in its passage.\"\n\nFire-Cocks. Churchwardens in London and within the bills of mortality, are to fix fire-cocks at proper distances in streets, and keep a large engine and hand-engine for extinguishing fire, under the penalty of 10l. flat. 6 Ann. c. 31.\n\nOn the breaking out of any fire in London or Westminster, the constables and beadles of parishes shall repair to the place with their staves, and assist in extinguishing it, and cause the people to work for that end, &c.\n\nFire-Engine. See Steam-Engine.\n\nFire-Flair, in Ichthyology. See Raja, Ichthyology Index.\n\nFire-Flies, a species of flies common in Guiana, of which there are two species. The largest is more than an inch in length, having a very large head connected with the body by a joint of a particular structure, with which at some times it makes a loud knock, particularly when laid on its back. The fly has two feelers or horns, two wings, and six legs. Under its belly is a circular patch, which, in the dark, shines like a candle; and on each side of the head near the eyes is a prominent, globular, luminous body, in size about one-third larger than a mustard seed. Each of these bodies is like a living star, emitting a bright, and not faint, light; since two or three of these animals, put into a glass vessel, afford light sufficient to read without difficulty, if placed close to the book. When the fly is dead, these bodies will still afford considerable light, though it is less vivid than before; and if bruised, and rubbed over the hands or face, they become luminous in the dark, like a board smeared over with phosphorus. They have a reddish brown or chestnut color; and live in rotten trees in the day, but are always abroad in the night. The other kind is not more than half as large as the former; their light proceeds from under their wings, and is seen only when they are elevated, like sparks of fire appearing or disappearing at every second. Of these the air is full in the night, though they are never seen in the day. They are common not only in the southern but in the northern parts of America, during the summer.\n\nFire-Lock, or Fusil, a small gun which fires with a flint. It is distinguished from an old musket, or match-lock, which was fired with a match. The flintlock is now in common use in the European armies.\n\nFire-Philosophers, or Philosophi per ignem, a fanatical sect of philosophers who appeared towards the close of the 16th century, and made a figure in almost all the countries of Europe. The distinguishing tenet from which they derived this appellation was, that the intimate essences of natural things were only to be known by the trying efforts of fire, directed in a chemical process. They were also called Theosophists, from their declaring against human reason as a dangerous and deceitful guide, and representing a divine and supernatural illumination as the only means of arriving at truth; they were likewise denominated Paracelsists, from the name of Paracelsus, the eminent physician and chemist, who was the chief ornament and leader of this extraordinary sect. It was patronized in England by Robert Fludd or Fludd, who endeavored to illustrate the philosophy of Paracelsus in a great number of treatises: in France it was zealously propagated by Rivier; in Denmark, by Severinus; in Germany, by Kunrath, an eminent physician of Dresden; and in other\nother countries by warm and successful votaries, who assumed a striking air of piety and devotion, and professed to themselves no other end than the advancement of the divine glory, and the restoration of peace and concord in a divided church; accordingly they were joined by several persons eminent for their piety, and distinguished by their zeal for the advancement of true religion. One of the most celebrated of these was Daniel Hoffman, professor of divinity in the university of Helmstadt, who, availing himself of some unguarded passages in the writings of Luther, extravagantly maintained, that philosophy was the mortal enemy of religion; that truth was divisible into two branches, the philosophical and theological; and that what was true in philosophy was false in theology. Hoffman, was afterwards obliged, by the interposition of Henry Julius, duke of Brunswick, to retract his invectives against philosophy, and to acknowledge in the most open manner the harmony and union of sound philosophy with true and genuine theology.\n\nFire-Places are contrivances for communicating heat to rooms, and also for answering various purposes of art and manufacture. See Chimney, Furnace, and Stove.\n\nThe ingenious Dr Franklin, having recounted the inconveniences and advantages of fire-places in common use, proposes a new contrivance for this purpose, called the Pennsylvania fire-place.\n\n1. This machine consists of a bottom-plate, or hearth-piece, fig. 1. Plate CCXVII, with a rising moulding before for a fender, two perforated ears F, G, for receiving two screw-rods; a long air-hole a, through which the outward air passes into an air-box; and three smoke-holes, represented by dark squares in BC, through which the smoke descends and passes away; besides, double ledges for receiving between them the lower edges of the other plates. 2. A back-plate without holes, and furnished with a pair of ledges to receive, 3. The two side-plates, each of which has a pair of ledges to receive the side edges of the front plate, with a shoulder on which it rests; two pair of ledges to receive the side edges of the two middle plates which form the air-box, and an oblong air-hole near the top, through which the air warmed in the box is discharged into the room, and a wing or bracket as H, and a small hole as R, for the axis of the register to turn in. See fig. 2, which represents one of these plates. 4. An air-box, composed of the two middle plates DE and FG, fig. 3. and 4. The first has five thin ledges or partitions cast on it, the edges of which are received into so many pairs of ledges cast in the other: the tops of all the cavities formed by these thin deep ledges are also covered by a ledge of the same form and depth cast with them; so that when the plates are put together, and the joints luted, there is no communication between the air-box and the smoke. In the winding passages of this box, fresh air is warmed as it passes into the room. 5. A front plate, which is arched on the under side, and ornamented with foliages, &c. 6. A top plate with a pair of ears, MN, (fig. 5.) answerable to those in the bottom plate, and perforated for the same purpose. It has also a pair of ledges running round the under side to receive the top edges of the front, back, and side plates. The air-box does not reach up to the top plate by 2\u00bd inches.\n\nAll these plates are of cast iron; and when they are all in their proper places, they are bound firmly together by a pair of slender rods of wrought iron with screws, and the machine appears as in fig. 5. There are also two thin plates of wrought iron, viz. 7. The shutter which is of such a length and breadth as to close well the opening of the fire-place, and serving to blow up the fire, and to secure it in the night. It is raised or depressed by means of two brass knobs, and slides in a groove left between the foremost ledge of the side plates and the face of the front plate. 8. The register, which is placed between the back plate and air-box, and furnished with a key; so that it may be turned on its axis, and made to lie in any position between level and upright. The operation of this machine, and the method of fixing it, may be understood by observing the profile of the chimney and fire-places in fig. 6. M is the mantle-piece or breast of the chimney; C the funnel; B the false back, made of brick work in the chimney, four inches or more from the true back, from the top of which a capping is to be made over to the breast of the chimney, that no air may pass into the chimney except that which goes under the false back, and up behind it: E the true back of the chimney; T the top of the fire-place; F the front of it; A the place where the fire is made; D the air-box; K the hole in the side plate, through which the warmed air is discharged out of the air-box into the room; H the hollow, formed by removing some bricks from the hearth under the bottom plate filled with fresh air, entering at the passage I, and ascending into the air-box through the air-hole in the bottom plate near G, the partition in the hollow, designed to keep the air and smoke apart; P the passage under the false back, and part of the hearth for the smoke; and the arrows in the figure show the course of the smoke. The fire being made at A, the flame and smoke will ascend, strike the top T, and give it a considerable heat; the smoke will turn over the air box, and descend between it and the back plate to the holes near G in the bottom plate, heating in its passage all the plates of the machine; it will then proceed under and behind the false back, and rise into the chimney. The air of the room contiguous to the several plates, and warmed by them, becomes specifically lighter than the other air in the room, and is obliged to rise; but being prevented by the closure over the fire-place from going up the chimney, is forced out into the room, and rising by the mantle-piece to the ceiling, is again driven down gradually by the steam of newly-warmed air that follows; and thus the whole room becomes in a little time equally warmed. The air also, warmed under the bottom plate and in the air-box, rises and comes out of the holes in the side plates, thus warming and continually changing the air of the room. In the capping of the chimney, a square opening for a trap-door should be left for the sweeper to go up: the door may be made of slate or tin, and so placed, that by turning up against the back of the chimney when open, it closes the vacancy behind the false back, and prevents the foot that falls in sweeping out upon the hearth. It will also be convenient to have a small hole, about five or six inches square, cut near the ceiling through into the funnel, and provided with a shutter; by occasionally opening which,\nwhich, the heated air of the room and smoke of tobacco, &c., may be carried off without inconveniencing the company. For a farther account of the manner of using this fire-place, the advantages attending it, answers to objections, and directions to the bricklayer in fixing it, the curious reader may consult Franklin's Letters and Papers on Philosophical Subjects, p. 284\u2014318, edit. 1769.\n\n**Fire-Pots**, in the military art, small earthen pots, into which is put a charged grenade, and over that powder enough till the grenade is covered; then the pot is covered with a piece of parchment, and two pieces of match across lighted: this pot being thrown by a handle of matches where it is designed, it breaks and fires the powder, and burns all that is near it, and likewise fires the powder in the grenade, which ought to have no fuse, to the end its operations may be the quicker.\n\n**Fire-Reeds.** See the next article, Note (c).\n\n**Fire-Ship,** an old vessel filled with combustible materials, and fitted with grappling irons to hook, and set fire to, the enemies ships in battle, &c.\n\nAs there is nothing particular in the construction of this ship, except the apparatus by which the fire is instantly conveyed from one part to another, and from thence to the enemy, it will be sufficient to describe the fire-room, where these combustibles are enclosed, together with the instruments necessary to grapple the ship intended to be destroyed.\n\nThe fire-room is built between decks, and limited on the after part by a bulk-head, L, behind the mainmast, from which it extends quite forward, as represented in Plate CCXVII. The train enclosed in this apartment is contained in a variety of wooden troughs, D, G, which intersect each other in different parts of the ship's length; being supported at proper distances by cross pieces and stanchions. On each side of the ship are fix or seven ports, H, about 18 inches broad and 15 inches high; and having their lids to open downward, contrary to the usual method.\n\nAgainst every port is placed an iron chamber (A), which, at the time of firing the ship, blows out the port-lid, and opens a passage for the flame. Immediately under the main and fore-throats is fixed a wooden funnel M; whose lower end communicates with a fire-barrel (B), by which the flame passing through the funnel is conducted to the throats. Between the funnels, which are likewise called fire-trunks, are two scuttles, or small holes, in the upper deck, serving also to let out the flames. Both funnels must be stopped with plugs, and have sailcloth or canvas nailed close over them, to prevent any accident happening from above to the combustibles laid below.\n\nThe ports, funnels, and scuttles, not only communicate the flames to the outside and upper works of the ship and her rigging; but likewise open a passage for the inward air, confined in the fire-room, which is thereby expanded so as to force impetuously through those outlets, and prevent the blowing up of the decks, which must of necessity happen from such a sudden and violent rarefaction of the air as will then be produced.\n\nOn each side of the bulk-head behind is cut a hole, L, of sufficient size to admit a trough of the same dimensions as the others. A leading trough, LI, whose foremost end communicates with another trough within the fire-room, is laid close to this opening, from whence it extends obliquely to a tally-port, I, cut through the ship's side. The decks and troughs are well covered with melted rosin. At the time of the firing\n\n---\n\n(A) The iron chambers are 10 inches long and 3.5 in diameter. They are breeched against a piece of wood fixed across the ports, and let into another a little higher. When loaded, they are almost filled with corn-powder, and have a wooden tampion well driven into their muzzles. They are primed with a small piece of quick-match thrust through their vents into the powder, with a part of it hanging out. When the ports are blown open by means of the iron chambers, the port-lids either fall downward, or are carried away by the explosion.\n\n(B) The fire-barrels ought to be of a cylindrical form, as most suitable to contain the reeds with which they are filled, and more convenient for flowing them between the troughs in the fire-room. Their inside chambers should not be less than 21 inches, and 30 inches is sufficient for their length. The bottom parts are first well stored with short double-dipped reeds placed upright; and the remaining vacancy is filled with fire-barrel composition well mixed and melted, and then poured over them. The composition used for this purpose is a mass of sulphur, pitch, tar, and tallow.\n\nThere are five holes, of three-fourths of an inch in diameter and three inches deep, formed in the top of the composition while it is yet warm; one being in the centre, and the other four at equal distances round the sides of the barrel. When the composition is cold and hard, the barrel is primed by filling these holes with fuse composition, which is firmly driven into them, so as to leave a little vacancy at the top to admit a strand of quick match twice doubled. The centre hole contains two strands at their whole length, and every strand must be driven home with meafed powder. The loose ends of the quick match being then laid within the barrel, the whole is covered with a dipped curtain, fastened on with a hoop that slips over the head of the barrel, to which it is nailed.\n\nThe barrels should be made very strong, not only to support the weight of the composition before firing, when they are moved or carried from place to place, but to keep them together whilst burning: for if the staves are too light and thin, so as to burn very soon, the remaining composition will tumble out and be dissipated, and the intention of the barrels, to carry the flame aloft, will accordingly be frustrated.\n\nThe curtain is a piece of coarse canvas, nearly a yard in breadth and length, thickened with melted composition, and covered with saw-dust on both sides.\nfiring either of the leading troughs, the flame is immediately conveyed to the opposite side of the ship, whereby both sides burn together.\n\nThe spaces N, O, behind the fire-room, represent the cabins of the lieutenant and mailer, one of which is on the starboard, and the other on the larboard side. The captain's cabin, which is separated from these by a bulk-head, is exhibited also by P.\n\nFour of the eight fire-barrels are placed under the four fire-trunks; and the other four between them, two on each side the fire-ducts, where they are securely cleated to the deck. The longest reeds (c) are put into the fore and aft trough, and tied down: the shortest reeds are laid in the troughs athwart, and tied down also. The bavins (v), dipped at one end, are tied fast to the troughs over the reeds, and the curtains are nailed up to the beams, in equal quantities, on each side of the fire-room.\n\nThe remainder of the reeds are placed in a position nearly upright, at all the angles of every square in the fire-room, and there tied down. If any reeds are left, they are to be put round the fire-barrels, and other vacant places, and there tied fast.\n\nInstructions to Prime.\n\nTake up all your reeds, one after another, and strew a little composition at the bottom of all the troughs under the reeds, and then tie them gently down again: next strew composition upon the upper part of the reeds throughout the fire-room; and upon the said composition lay double quick match upon all the reeds, in all the troughs: the remainder of the composition strew over all the fire-room, and then lay your bavins loofe.\n\nCast off all the covers of the fire-barrels, and hang the quick match loofe over their sides, and place leaders of quick match from the reeds into the barrels, and from thence into the vent of the chambers, in such a manner as to be certain of their blowing open the ports, and setting fire to the barrels. Two troughs of communication from each door of the fire-room to the fally ports, must be laid with a strong leader of quick-match, four or five times double: also a cross-piece to go from the fally-port, when the ship is fired, to the communication trough, laid with leaders of quick-match, that the fire may be communicated in both sides at once.\n\nWhat quick-match is left place so that the fire may be communicated to all parts of the room at once, especially about the ports and fire-barrels, and see that the chambers are well and fresh primed. [N. B. The port-fire used for firing the ship, burns about 12 minutes. Great care must be taken to have no powder on board when the ship is fired.]\n\nThe sheer hooks (represented by A) are fitted so as to fasten on the yard-arms of the fire-ship, where they hook the enemy's rigging. The fire-grapplings (B) are either fixed on the yard-arms, or thrown by hand, having a chain to confine the ships together, or fasten those instruments wherever necessary.\n\nWhen the commanding officer of a fleet displays the signal to prepare for action, the fire-ships fix their sheer hooks, and dispose their grapplings in readiness. The battle being begun, they proceed immediately to prime, and prepare their fire-works. When they are ready for grappling, they inform the admiral thereof by a particular signal.\n\nTo avoid being disabled by the enemy's cannon during a general engagement, the fire-ships continue sufficiently distant from their line of battle, either to windward or to leeward.\n\nThey cautiously shun the openings or intervals of the line, where they would be directly exposed to the enemy's fire, from which they are covered by lying on the opposite side of their own ships. They are attentively to observe the signals of the admiral or his seconds, in order to put their designs immediately in execution.\n\nAlthough no ship of the line should be previously appointed to protect any fire-ship, except a few of the smallest particularly destined to this service, yet the ship before whom she passes in order to approach the enemy, should escort her thither, and assist her with an armed boat, or whatever succour may be necessary in her situation.\n\nThe captain of the fire-ship should himself be particularly attentive that the above instructions are punctually executed, and that the yards may be so braced when he falls alongside of the ship intended to be destroyed, that the sheer-hooks and grapplings fastened to the yard-arms, &c., may effectually hook the enemy. He is expected to be the last person who quits the vessel; and being furnished with every necessary assistance and support, his reputation will greatly depend on the success of his enterprise.\n\nLambent Fires, as the shining of meat at certain seasons, the luminousness of the tea, of insects, vapours, &c.

They are distinguished into two kinds, viz. the long and short; the former of which are four feet, and the latter two feet five inches in length. One part of them are singly dipped, i.e. at one end; the rest are dipped at both ends in a kettle of melted composition. After being immersed about seven or eight inches in this preparation, and then drained, they are sprinkled over with pulverized sulphur upon a tanned hide.\n\n(d) The bavins are made of birch, heath, or other brush-wood, which is tough and readily kindled. They are usually two or three feet in length, and have all their bush-ends lying one way, the other ends being tied together with small cords. They are dipped in composition at the bush-ends, whose branches are afterwards confined by the hand, to prevent them from breaking off by moving about; and also to make them burn more fiercely. After being dipped in the same manner as the reeds, they also are sprinkled with sulphur.\nFiring, sulphur, and other inflammable and combustible ingredients, used on occasion of public rejoicings and other solemnities.\n\nThe invention of fire-works is by M.

See Pyrotechny.","sp":253,"ep":267},{"h":"FIRING","t":"in the military art, denotes the discharge of the fire-arms; and its object is to do the utmost execution to the enemy.\n\nThe method of firing by platoons is said to have been invented by Guglielmo Adolphus, and first used about the year 1618; the reason commonly given for this method is, that a constant fire may be always kept up. There are three different ways of platoon firing; viz. standing, advancing, and retreating. But previous to every kind of firing, each regiment or battalion must be told off in grand divisions, subdivisions, and platoons, exclusively of the grenadiers, which form two subdivisions or four platoons of themselves. In firing standing, either by divisions or platoons, the first fire is from the division or platoon on the right; the second fire from the left; the third from the right again; and so on alternately, till the firing comes to the centre platoon, which is generally called the colour platoon, and does not fire, remaining as a reserve for the colours. Firing advancing is performed in the same manner, with this addition, that before either division or platoon fires, it advances three paces forward. Firing retreating varies from either of the former methods; for before either division or platoon fires, if they are marching from the enemy, it must go to the right about, and after firing, to the left about again, and continue the retreat as slow and orderly as possible.\n\nIn hedge firing the men are drawn up two deep, and in that order both ranks are to fire standing. Oblique firing is either to the right and left, or from the right and left to the centre, according to the situation of the object. The Prussians have a particular contrivance for this purpose; if they are to level to the right, the rear ranks of every platoon make two quick but small paces to the left, and the body of each soldier turns one-eighth of a circle, and vice versa. Parapet firing depends on the nature of the parapet over which the men are to fire, and also upon that of the attack made to protect it. This method of firing is sometimes performed by single ranks stepping on the banquette and firing; each man instantly handing his arms to the centre rank of the same file, and taking his back in the room of it; and the centre rank giving it to the rear to load, and forwarding the arms of the rear to the front rank; by which means the front rank men can fire six or seven rounds in a minute with exactness. Parapet firing may also be executed two deep, when the banquette is three feet broad, or in field works where no banquettes are made. Square firing is performed by a regiment or body of men drawn up in a hollow square, in which case each front is generally divided into four divisions or firings, and the flanks of the square, being the weakest part, are covered by four platoons of grenadiers. The first fire is from the right division of each face; the second from the left division of each face, &c. and the grenadiers make the last fire. Street firing is practised in two ways; either by making the division or platoon that has fired to wheel by half-rank to the right and left outwards from the centre, and to march in that order by half divisions down the flanks on each side of the column, and to draw up in the rear, and go on with their priming and loading; or, to make the division or platoon, after firing, to face to the right and left outwards from the centre, and one half rank to follow the other; and in that order to march in one centre file down on each side of the column into the rear, and there draw up as before.\n\nFiring Iron, in Farriery, an instrument not unlike the blade of a knife; which being made red hot is applied to a horse's hams, or other places standing in need of it, as in preternatural swellings, farcy, knots, &c. in order to disperse them.","sp":267,"ep":267},{"h":"FIRKIN","t":"an English measure of capacity for things liquid, being the fourth part of the barrel: it contains eight gallons of ale, loap, or herrings; and nine gallons of beer.","sp":267,"ep":267},{"h":"FIRLOT","t":"a dry measure used in Scotland.

Nothing is known with certainty respecting his country, profession, or character, as we find no mention made of him in the writings of ancient authors. Some say that he was by birth a Sicilian, and practised in the forum as a barrister for some time, becoming a convert to Christianity when far advanced in years; which appears to derive considerable support from different passages in his writings. He was author of a treatise De errore profanarum religionum, which was dedicated to the emperors Constantius and Constans. This work...\nFirmness must have been written between 340 and 350, in which Confutans was slain by Magnentius. It is allowed to be a learned, able, and well written performance, in which the reasonableness of the Christian religion is strongly contrasted with the absurdity and immorality of the gentile creed. It must not be dissembled, however, that he sometimes betrays such a spirit of intolerance as is wholly incompatible with the genius of the Christian religion, which breathes nothing but benevolence towards the whole human race. The arguments employed by him in its defence are disgraced by an exhortation to the civil power to propagate it by force of arms, and to crush the advocates of error by severe edicts. This work was first published at Stra\u00dfburg in 1562, at Heidelberg in 1559, and at Paris in 1610.\n\nThe greater part of critics ascribe to him a work entitled *Afronimorum, seu de Mathesi*, lib. viii. In it he treats of the power and influence of the stars, agreeably to the doctrine of the Egyptians and Babylonians, blending a considerable degree of mathematical knowledge with the unmeaning jargon of judicial astrology. Those who imagine that so good a man as Firmicus could not have been the author of such an absurd performance, should remember that it was probably composed prior to his conversion, when such absurdities would constitute a part of his creed.\n\n**Firmness**, denotes the consistence of a body, or that state wherein its sensible parts cohere in such a manner, that the motion of one part induces a motion in the rest.\n\n**First-born.** See Primogeniture, for the literal meaning of the term.\n\nIn Scripture it is also used often in a figurative sense for that which is first, most excellent, most distinguished in any thing. Thus it is said of Christ (Col. i. 5.), that he is \"the first-born of every creature;\" and in Revelation (i. 5.) he is called \"the first-begotten of the dead;\" that is, according to the commentators, begotten of the Father before any creature was produced; and the first who rose from the dead by his own power. \"The first-born of the poor,\" (Isa. xiv. 30.) signifies, The most miserable of all the poor; and in Job (xviii. 13.) \"The first-born of death;\" that is, The most terrible of all deaths.\n\n**First Fruits (primitive),** among the Hebrews, were oblations of part of the fruits of the harvest, offered to God as an acknowledgment of his sovereign dominion. The first of these fruits was offered in the name of the whole nation, being either two loaves of bread, or a sheaf of barley which was threshed in the court of the temple. Every private person was obliged to bring his first fruits to the temple; and these consisted of wheat, barley, grapes, figs, apricots, olives, and dates.\n\nThere was another sort of first fruits which were paid to God. When bread was kneaded in a family, a portion of it was set apart and given to the priest or Levite who dwelt in the place; if there was no priest or Levite there, it was cast into the oven, and consumed by the fire. These offerings made a considerable part of the revenues of the Hebrew priesthood.\n\nFirst Fruits are frequently mentioned in ancient Christian writers as one part of the church revenue. One of the councils of Carthage enjoins, that they should consist only of grapes and corn; which shows, that this was the practice of the African church.\n\n**First Fruits,** in the church of England, are the profits of every spiritual benefice for the first year, according to the valuation thereof in the king's books.\n\n**Fisc,** (Fiscus), in the Civil Law, the treasury of a prince or state; or that to which all things due to the public do fall. The word is derived from the Greek \u03c6\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, \"a great basket,\" used when they went to market.\u2014By the civil law, none but a sovereign prince has a right to have a fisc or public treasury.\n\nAt Rome, under the emperors, the term ararium was used for the revenues destined for support of the charges of the empire; the fiscus for those of the emperor's own family. The treasury, in effect, belonged to the people, and the fiscus to the prince. Hence the goods of condemned persons, if appropriated to the use of the public, were said publicari; if to the support of the emperor or prince, conficari.\n\n**Fiscal,** in the Civil Law, something relating to the pecuniary interest of the prince or people. The officers appointed for the management of the fisc, were called procuratores fisci, and advocati fisci; and among the cases enumerated in the constitutions of the empire where it was their business to plead, one is against those who have been condemned to pay a fine to the fisc on account of their litigionsnels or frivolous appeals.\n\n**Fiscus.** See Fisc.\n\n**Fish,** in Natural History, an animal that lives in the waters as the natural place of its abode.\n\nFishes form the fourth class of animals in the Linnaean system. Their most general or popular division is into fresh and salt water ones. Some, however, are of opinion, that all fishes naturally inhabit the salt waters, and that they have mounted up into rivers only by accident. A few species only swim up into the rivers to deposit their spawn; but by far the greatest number keep in the sea, and would soon expire in fresh water. There are about 400 species of fishes (according to Linn\u00e6us) of which we know something; but the unknown ones are supposed to be many more; and as they are thought to lie in great depths of the sea remote from land, it is probable that many species will remain for ever unknown.\n\nFor the subdivisions, characters, and natural history of this class of animals, see Ichthyology Index.\n\n**Blowing of Fish,** is a practice similar to that of blowing flesh, poultry, and pigs, and adopted for the same deceitful purposes. The method of blowing fish, especially cod and whitings, is by placing the end of a quill or tobacco-pipe at the vent, and pricking a hole with a pin under the fin which is next the gill; thereby making the fish appear to the eye large and full, which when dressed will be flabby, and little else than skin and bones. But this imposition may be discovered by placing the finger and thumb on each side of the vent, and squeezing it hard; the wind may be perceived to go out, the skin will fall in, and the fish appear lank, and of little value.\n\n**Breeding of Fishes** may be turned to great advantage; for, besides furnishing the table, obliging one's friends, and raising money, the land will be thereby greatly\ngreatly improved, so as to yield more this way than by any other employment whatever. See Fish Pond.\n\nCastration of Fish, is a method first practised by Mr Tull, in order to prevent the excessive increase of fish in some of his ponds, where the numbers did not permit any of them to grow to an advantageous size. But he afterwards found, that the castrated fish grew much larger than their usual size, were more fat, and always in season. This operation may be performed both on male and female fish; and the most eligible time for it is when the ovaries of the female have their ova in them, and when the vessels of the male, analogous to these, have their seminal matter in them; because, at this time, these vessels are more easily distinguished from the ureters, which convey the urine from the kidneys into the bladder, and are situated near the seminal vessels on each side of the spine; which, without sufficient attention, may be mistaken for the ovaries, especially when these last are empty. The time least proper for this operation, is just after they have spawned, because the fish are then too weak and languid to bear, with success, so severe an operation; however, with skill and care, it may be performed almost at any time. When a fish is to be castrated, it must be held in a wet cloth, with its belly upwards; then with a sharp penknife, having its point bent backwards, the operator cuts through the integuments of the rim of the belly, taking care not to wound any of the intestines. As soon as a small aperture is made, he carefully inserts a hooked pen-knife, and with this dilates the aperture from between the two fore-fins almost to the anus. He then, with two small blunt silver hooks, five or six inches long, and of this form P, by the help of an assistant, holds open the belly of the fish; and with a spoon or spatula, removes carefully the intestines from one side. When these are removed, you see the ureter, a small vessel, nearly in the direction of the spine, and also the ovary, a larger vessel, lying before it, nearer the integuments of the belly. This last vessel is taken up with a hook of the same kind with those before mentioned, and, after detaching it from the side far enough for the purpose, divided transversely with a pair of sharp scissors, care being taken that the intestines are not wounded or injured. After one of the ovaries has been divided, the operator proceeds to divide the other in the same manner; and then the divided integuments of the belly are sewed with silk, the stitches being inserted at a small distance from one another. Mr Tull observes farther, that the spawning time is very various; that trouts are full about Christmas; perch in February; pikes in March, and carp and tench in May; and that allowance must be made for climate and situation, with regard to the spawning of fish. When the fish are castrated, they are put into the water where they are intended to continue; and they take their chance in common with other fish, as though they were not castrated. With tolerable care, few die of the operation. Phil. Trans. vol. xlviii. Part 2. Art. 106.\n\nAlthough we could not properly avoid inserting the above detail, it is presumed that few will be pleased with the invention. The operation is peculiarly cruel, and the purpose of it only a detestable piece of Apician refinement.\n\nFeeding of Fishes. When they are fed in large pools or ponds, either malt boiled, or fresh grains, is the best food; thus carps may be raised and fed like capons, and tenches will feed as well. The care of feeding them is best committed to a gardener or the butler, who should be always at hand. When fed in a stew, any sort of grain boiled, especially peas, and malt coarsely ground, are proper food; also the grains after brewing, while fresh and sweet; but one bullock of malt not brewed will go as far as two of grains.\n\nStealing of Fish, by persons armed and disguised, is felony without benefit of clergy, by 9 Geo. I. cap. 22. See Black Act. And by 5 Geo. III. cap. 14, the penalty of transportation for seven years is inflicted on persons stealing or taking fish in any water, within a park, paddock, orchard, or yard; and on the receivers, aiders, and abettors; and a forfeiture of five pounds to the owner of the fishery is made payable by persons taking or destroying (or attempting so to do) any fish in any river or other water within any enclosed ground, being private property.\n\nPreserving of Fish for Cabinets. Linnaeus's method is, to expose them to the air; and when they acquire such a degree of putrefaction that the skin loses its cohesion to the body of the fish, it may be slid off almost like a glove; the two sides of this skin may then be dried upon paper like a plant, or one of the sides may be filled with plaster of Paris to give the subject a due plumpness.\n\nA fish may be prepared, after it has acquired this degree of putrefaction, by making a longitudinal incision on the belly, and carefully dissecting the fleshy part from the skin, which is but slightly attached to it in consequence of the putrefaction. The skin is then to be filled with cotton and the antiseptic powder as directed for birds; and, lastly, to be sewed up where the incision was made.\n\nGold Fish.

The cement for this purpose is prepared, by putting some burgundy pitch into a new earthen pot, and warming the vessel till it receives so much of the pitch as will stick round it; then strewing some finely powdered amber before the pitch when growing cold, adding a mixture of three pounds of linseed oil and one of oil of turpentine, covering the vessel, and boiling them for an hour over a gentle fire, and grinding the mixture, as it is wanted, with so much pumice-stone in fine powder as will reduce it to the consistence of paint. The fish being wiped dry, the mixture is spread upon it; and the gold-leaf being then laid on, and gently pressed down, the fish may be immediately put into water again, without any danger of the gold coming off, for the matter quickly grows firm in water.\n\nFish, in a ship, a plank or piece of timber, fastened to a ship's mast or yard, to strengthen it; which is done by nailing it on with iron spikes, and winding ropes hard about them.\n\nFishes, in Heraldry, are the emblems of silence and watchfulness; and are borne either upright, inwound, extended, endorsed respecting each other, surmounting one another, fretted, &c.\n\nIn blazoning fishes, those borne feeding, should be termed devouring; all fishes borne upright and having fins,\nFisher, fins, should be blazoned hauriant; and those borne transverse the escutcheon, must be termed naiant.\n\nFish Ponds, those made for the breeding or feeding of fish.\n\nFish ponds are no small improvement of watery and boggy lands, many of which are fit for no other use. In making of a pond, its head should be at the lowest part of the ground, that the trench of the flood-gate or sluice, having a good fall, may not be too long in emptying. The best way of making the head secure, is to drive in two or three rows of stakes above six feet long, at above four feet distance from each other, the whole length of the pond head, whereof the first row should be rammed at least about four feet deep. If the bottom is false, the foundation may be laid with quicklime; which flaking, will make it as hard as a stone. Some lay a layer of lime, and another of earth dug out of the pond, among the piles and stakes; and when these are well covered, drive in others as they see occasion, ramming in the earth as before, till the pond head be of the height designed.\n\nThe dam should be made sloping on each side, leaving a waite to carry off the over abundance of water in times of floods or rains; and as to the depth of the pond, the deepest part need not exceed six feet, rising gradually in shoals towards the sides, for the fish to run themselves, and lay their spawn. Gravelly and sandy bottoms, especially the latter, are best for breeding; and a fat soil with a white fat water, as the washings of hills, commons, streets, finks, &c. is best for fattening all sorts of fish. For storing a pond, carp is to be preferred for its goodmels, quick growth, and great increase, as breeding five or six times a-year. A pond of an acre, if it be a feeding and not breeding one, will every year feed 200 carps of three years old, 300 of two years old, and 400 of a year old. Carps delight in ponds that have marl or clay bottoms, with plenty of weeds and grass, whereon they feed in the hot months.\n\nPonds should be drained every three or four years, and the fish sorted. In breeding ones, the smaller ones are to be taken out, to store other ponds with; leaving a good stock of females, at least eight or nine years old, as they never breed before that age. In feeding ponds, it is best to keep them pretty near of a size.","sp":267,"ep":270},{"h":"FISHER","t":"JOHN, bishop of Rochester, was born at Beverly in Yorkshire, in the year 1459, and educated in the collegiate church of that place. In 1484, he removed to Michael house in Cambridge, of which college he was elected master in the year 1495. Having applied himself to the study of divinity, he took orders; and, becoming eminent as a divine, attracted the notice of Margaret countess of Richmond, mother of Henry VII., who made him her chaplain and confessor. In 1501, he took the degree of doctor of divinity, and the same year was elected chancellor of the university. In the year following, he was appointed Lady Margaret's first divinity professor; and in 1504, consecrated bishop of Rochester; which small bishopric he would never resign, though he was offered both Ely and Lincoln. It is generally allowed, that the foundation of the two colleges of Christ church and St John's, in Cambridge, was entirely owing to Bishop Fisher's persuasion and influence with the countess of Richmond: he not only formed the design, but superintended the execution. On the promulgation of Martin Luther's doctrine, our bishop was the first to enter the lists against him. On this occasion he exerted all his influence, and is generally supposed to have written the famous book by which Henry VIII. obtained the title of Defender of the Faith. Hitherto he continued in favour with the king; but in 1527, opposing his divorce, and denying his supremacy, the implacable Harry determined, and finally effected, his destruction. In 1543, the parliament found him guilty of misprision of treason, for concealing certain prophetic speeches of a fanatical impostor, called the Holy Maid of Kent, relative to the king's death; and condemned him, with five others, in lots of goods, and imprisonment during his majesty's pleasure; but he was released on paying 300l. for the king's life.\n\nKing Henry being now married to Anne Boleyn, his obsequious parliament took an oath of allegiance proper for the occasion. This oath the bishop of Rochester steadily refused; alleging, that his conscience could not be convinced that the king's first marriage was against the law of God. For refusing this oath of succession, he was attainted by the parliament of 1534; and committed to the Tower, where he was cruelly treated, and were he would probably have died a natural death, had not the pope created him a cardinal. The king, now positively determined on his destruction, sent Rich, the solicitor general, under the pretence of consulting the bishop on a case of conscience, but really with a design to draw him into a conversation concerning the supremacy. The honest old bishop spoke his mind without suspicion or reserve, and an indictment and conviction of high treason was the consequence. He was beheaded at Tower Hill, on the 22d of June 1535, in the 77th year of his age. Thus died this good old prelate; who, notwithstanding his inflexible enmity to the Reformation, was undoubtedly a learned, pious, and honest man. He wrote several treatises against Luther, and other works, which were printed at Wurtzburg, in 1597, in one volume folio.","sp":270,"ep":270},{"h":"FISHERY","t":"a place where great numbers of fish are caught.\n\nThe principal fisheries for salmon, herring, mackerel, pilchards, &c. are along the coasts of Scotland, England, and Ireland; for cod, on the banks of Newfoundland; for whales, about Greenland; and for pearls, in the East and West Indies.\n\nFree Fishery, in Law, or an exclusive right of fishing in a public river, is a royal franchise; and is considered as such in all countries where the feudal policy has prevailed: though the making such grants, and by that means appropriating, what it seems unnatural to restrain, the use of running water, was prohibited for the future by King John's Great Charter; and the rivers that were fenced in his time were directed to be laid open, as well as the forests to be disforested. This opening was extended by the second and third charters of Henry III. to those also that were fenced under Richard I.; so that a franchise of free fishery ought now to be as old at least as the reign of Henry II. This differs from a several of piscary, because he that has a several fishery must also be the owner of the foil, which in a free fishery is not requisite. It differs also from a common fishery in that the free fishery is an exclusive right,\nright, the common fishery is not so; and therefore, in a free fishery, a man has property in the fish before they are caught; in a common pilcary, not till afterwards. Some indeed have considered a free fishery not as a royal franchise; but merely as a private grant of liberty to fish in the several fishery of the grant. But the conferring such right as originally a flower of the prerogative, till restrained by Magna Charta, and derived by royal grant (previous to the reign of Richard I.) to such as now claim it by prescription, may remove some difficulties in respect to this matter with which our law books are embarrassed.","sp":270,"ep":271},{"h":"FISHERY","t":"Y denotes also the commerce of fish, more particularly the catching them for sale.\n\nWere we to enter into a very minute and particular consideration of fisheries, as at present established in this kingdom, this article would swell beyond its proper bounds; because, to do justice to a subject of such concernment to the British nation, requires a very ample and distinct discussion. We shall, however, observe, that since the Divine Providence hath so eminently stored the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland with the most valuable fish; and since fisheries, if successful, become permanent nurseries for breeding expert fishermen; it is not only a duty we owe to the Supreme Being, not to despise the wonderful plenty he hath afforded us, by neglecting to extend this branch of commerce to the utmost; but it is a duty we owe to our country, for its natural security, which depends upon the strength of our royal navy. No nation can have a navy where there is not a fund of benefits to breed and employ fishermen without any expense to the public, and no trade is so well calculated for training up these useful members of society as fisheries.\n\nThe situation of the British coasts is the most advantageous in the world for catching fish: the Scottish islands, particularly those to the north and west, lie most commodious for carrying on the fishing trade to perfection; for no country in Europe can pretend to come up to Scotland in the abundance of the finest fish, with which its various creeks, bays, rivers, lakes, and coasts, are replenished. Of these advantages the Scots seem indeed to have been abundantly sensible; and their traffic in herrings, the most valuable of all the fisheries, is noticed in history so early as the ninth century. The frequent laws which were enacted in the reigns of James III., IV., and V., discover a steady determined zeal for the benefit of the native subjects, and the full restoration of the fisheries, which the Dutch had latterly found means to engross; and do honour to the memory of those patriots whom modern times affect to call barbarians.\n\nThe expedition of James V. to the Hebrides and western parts of the Highlands and his assiduity in exploring and founding the harbours, discovered a fixed resolution in that active prince, to civilize the inhabitants, to promote the valuable fisheries at their doors, and to introduce general industry. His death, at an early period, and the subsequent religious and civil commotions in the kingdom, frustrated those wise designs, and the western fisheries remained in their original state of neglect. At length, 1602, James VI. returned the national purposes which had been thus chalked out by his grandfather. \"Three towns (says Dr Robertson) which might serve as a retreat for the industrious, and a nursery for arts and commerce, were appointed to be built in different parts of the Highlands; one in Caithness, another in Lochaber, and a third in the isle of Lewis; and in order to draw the inhabitants thither, all the privileges of the royal boroughs were to be conferred upon them. Finding it, however, to be no easy matter to inspire the inhabitants of those countries with the love of industry, a resolution was taken to plant amongst them colonies of people from the more industrious counties. The first experiment was made in the isle of Lewis; and as it was advantageously situated for the fishing trade (a source from which Scotland ought naturally to derive great wealth), the colony transported thither was drawn out of Fife, the inhabitants of which were well skilled in that branch of commerce. But before they had remained there long enough to manifest the good effects of this institution, the islanders, enraged at seeing their country occupied by those intruders, took arms, and surprising them in the night time, murdered some of them, and compelled the rest to abandon the settlement. The king's attention being soon turned to other objects, particularly to his succession to the English crown, we hear no more of this salutary project.\"\n\nThe Scottish fisheries were, however, resumed by Charles I. who \"ordained an association of the three kingdoms, for a general fishing within the hail seas and coasts of his majesty's said kingdoms; and for the government of the said association, ordained, that there should be a standing committee chosen and nominated by his majesty, and his successors from time to time.\" &c. &c. Several persons of distinction embarked in the design, which the king honoured with his patronage, and encouraged by his bounty. He also ordered lent to be more strictly observed; prohibited the importation of fish taken by foreigners; and agreed to purchase from the company his naval stores and the fish for his fleets. Thus the scheme of establishing a fishery in the Hebrides began to assume a favourable aspect; but all the hopes of the adventurers were frustrated by the breaking out of the civil wars, and the very tragic death of their benefactor.\n\nIn 1661, Charles II., the duke of York, Lord Clarendon, and other persons of rank and fortune, resumed the business of the fisheries with greater vigour than any of their predecessors. For this purpose the most salutary laws were enacted by the parliaments of England and Scotland; in virtue of which, all materials used in, or depending upon, the fisheries, were exempted from all duties, excises, or imposts whatever. In England, the company were authorized to set up a lottery, and to have a voluntary collection in all parish churches; houses of entertainment, as taverns, inns, ale-houses, were to take one or more barrels of herrings, at the stated price of 30s. per barrel; and 2s. 6d. per barrel was to be paid to the stock of this company on all imported fish taken by foreigners. Some Dutch families were also invited, or permitted, to settle in Stormont: the herrings cured by the Royal English company gave general satisfaction, and, as mentioned above, brought a high price for those days. Every circumstance attending this new establishment seemed to be the result of a judicious plan and thorough knowledge of the\nbusiness, when the necessities of the king obliged him to withdraw his subscription or bounty; which gave such umbrage to the parties concerned, that they soon after dissolved.\n\nIn 1677, a new royal company was established in England, at the head of which was the duke of York, the earl of Derby, &c. Besides all the privileges which former companies had enjoyed, the king granted this new company a perpetuity, with power to purchase lands; and also \u00a320,000 to be paid them annually, out of the customs of the port of London, for every dogger or buss they should build and send out for seven years to come. A stock of 15,980l. was immediately advanced, and afterwards 1600l. more. This small capital was soon exhausted in purchasing and fitting out busses, with other incidental expenses. The company, made, however, a successful beginning; and one of their busses or doggers actually took and brought home 32,000 cod fish; other vessels had also a favourable fishery. Such favourable beginnings might have excited fresh subscriptions, when an unforeseen event ruined the whole design beyond the possibility of recovery. Most of the busses had been built in Holland, and manned with Dutchmen; on which pretence the French, who were then at war with Holland, seized six out of seven vessels, with their cargoes and fishing tackle: and the company being now in debt, sold, in 1680, the remaining stores, &c. A number of gentlemen and merchants raised a new subscription of 60,000l. under the privileges and immunities of the former charter. This attempt also came to nothing, owing to the death of the king, and the troubles of the subsequent reign.\n\nSoon after the Revolution this business was again resumed, and upon a more extensive scale; the proposed capital being 300,000l., of which 100,000l. was to have been raised by the surviving patentees or their successors, and 200,000l. by new subscribers. Copies of the letters patent, the constitution of the company, and terms of subscription, were lodged at sundry places in London and Westminster, for the perusal of the public, while the subscription was filling. It is probable, that King William's partiality to the Dutch fisheries, the succeeding war, or both of these circumstances, frustrated this new attempt; of which we have no farther account in the annals of that reign or since.\n\nThe Scottish parliament had also, during the three last reigns, passed sundry acts for erecting companies and promoting the fisheries; but the intestine commotions of that country, and the great exertions which were made for the Darien establishment, enfeebled all other attempts, whether collectively or by individuals, within that kingdom.\n\nIn 1749, his late majesty having, at the opening of the parliament, warmly recommended the improvement of the fisheries, the house of commons appointed a committee to inquire into the state of the herring and white fisheries, and to consider of the most probable means of extending the same. All ranks of men were elevated with an idea of the boundless riches that would flow into the kingdom from this source. A subscription of 500,000l. was immediately filled in the city, by a body of men who were incorporated for 21 years by the name of The Society of the Free British Fishery. Every encouragement was held out by government, both to the society, and to individuals who might embark in this national business. A bounty of 30s. per ton was to be paid annually out of the customs, for 14 years, to the owners of all decked vessels or busses, from 20 to 80 tons burden, which should be built after the commencement of the act, for the use of, and fitted out and employed in, the said fisheries, whether by the Society or any other persons. At the same time numerous pamphlets and newspaper essays came forth; all pretending to elucidate the subject, and to convince the public with what facility the herring fisheries might be transferred from Dutch to British hands. This proved, however, a more arduous task than had been foreseen by superficial speculators. The Dutch were frugal in their expenditures and living; perfect masters of the arts of fishing and curing, which they had carried to the greatest height and perfection. They were in full possession of the European markets; and their fish, whether delivered or otherwise, had the reputation of superior qualities to all others taken in our seas. With such advantages, the Dutch not only maintained their ground against this formidable company, but had also the pleasure of seeing the capital gradually sinking, without having procured an adequate return to the adventurers; notwithstanding various aids and efforts of government from time to time in their favour, particularly in 1757, when an advance of 20s. per ton was added to the bounty.\n\nIn 1780 the public attention was again called to the state of the British fisheries, by the suggestions of Mr Dempster in the house of commons, and by different publications that appeared upon the subject; in consequence of which the minister suffered a committee to be named; to inquire into this great source of national wealth. To that committee it appeared, that the best way of improving the fisheries was to encourage the inhabitants living nearest to the seat of them to become fishers: And it being found that the north-western coast of the kingdom, though abounding with fish and with fine harbours, was utterly destitute of towns, an act was passed for incorporating certain persons therein named, by the style of \"The British Society for extending the fisheries and improving the sea coasts of the kingdom;\" and to enable them to subscribe a joint stock, and therewith to purchase lands, and build thereon free towns, villages, and fishing stations, in the Highlands and islands in that part of Great Britain called Scotland, and for other purposes. The isle of Mull, Loch Broom, the isles of Sky and of Cannay, have already been pitched upon as proper situations for some of these towns. The progress of such an undertaking from its nature must be slow, but still slower when carried on with a limited capital arising from the subscriptions of a few public-spirited individuals. But it is not to be doubted but that it will ultimately tend to the increase of our fisheries, and to the improvement of the Highland part of this kingdom. Its tendency is also to lessen the emigration of a brave and industrious race of inhabitants, too many of whom have already removed with their families to America.\n\nI. Anchovy Fishery. The anchovy is caught in the months of May, June, and July, on the coasts of Catalonia, Provence, &c., at which season it constantly repairs up the straits of Gibraltar, into the Mediterranean.\nCollins says they are also found in plenty on the western coasts of England and Wales.\n\nThe fishing for them is chiefly in the night time; when a light being put on the stern of their little fishing vessels, the anchovies flock round, and are caught in the nets. But then it is asserted to have been found by experience, that anchovies taken thus by fire, are neither so good, so firm, nor so proper for keeping, as those which are taken without fire.\n\nWhen the fishery is over, they cut off the heads, take out their gall and guts, and then lay them in barrels, and salt them. The common way of eating anchovies is with oil, vinegar, &c. in order to which they are first boned, and the tails, fins, &c. slipped off.\u2014Being put on the fire, they dissolve almost in any liquor. Or they are made into a sauce by mincing them with pepper, &c. Some also pickle anchovies in small delft or earthen pots, made on purpose, of two or three pounds weight, more or less, which they cover with plaster to keep them the better. Anchovies should be chosen small, fresh pickled, white on the outside and red within. They must have a round back; for those which are flat or large are often nothing but sardines. Besides these qualities, the pickle, on opening the pots or barrels, must be of a good taste, and not have lost its flavour.\n\n2. Cod Fishery. There are two kinds of cod fish; the one green or white cod, and the other dried or cured cod; though it is all the same fish, differently prepared; the former being sometimes salted and barrelled, then taken out for use; and the latter, having lain some competent time in salt, dried in the sun or smoke. We shall therefore speak of each of these apart; and first of the\n\nGreen. The chief fisheries for green cod are in the bay of Canada, on the great bank of Newfoundland, and on the isle of St Peter, and the isle of Sable; to which places vessels resort from divers parts both of Europe and America. They are from 100 to 150 tons burden, and will catch between 30,000 and 40,000 cod each. The most essential part of the fishery is, to have a master who knows how to cut up the cod, one who is skilled to take off the head properly, and above all a good falter, on which the preserving of them, and consequently the success of the voyage depends. The best season is from the beginning of February to the end of April; the fish, which in the winter retire to the deepest water, coming then on the banks, and fattening extremely. What is caught from March to June keeps well; but those taken in July, August, and September, when it is warm on the banks, are apt to spoil soon. Every fisher takes but one at a time: the most expert will take from 350 to 400 in a day; but that is the most, the weight of the fish and the great coldness on the bank fatiguing very much. As soon as the cod are caught, the head is taken off; they are opened, gutted, and salted; and the falter flows them in the bottom of the hold, head to tail, in beds a fathom or two square; laying layers of salt and fish alternately, but never mixing fish caught on different days. When they have lain thus three or four days to drain off the water, they are replaced in another part of the ship, and salted again; where they remain till the vessel is loaded. Sometimes they are cut in thick pieces, and put in barrels for the convenience of carriage.\n\nDry. The principal fishery for this article is, from Cape Rose to the Bay des Exports, along the coast of Placentia, in which compass there are divers commodious ports for the fish to be dried in. These, though of the same kind with the fresh cod, are much smaller, and therefore fitter to keep, as the salt penetrates more easily into them. The fishery of both is much alike; only this latter is most expensive, as it takes up more time and employs more hands, and yet scarce half so much salt is spent in this as in the other. The bait is herrings, of which great quantities are taken on the coast of Placentia. When several vessels meet and intend to fish in the same part, he whose flotilla first touches ground becomes entitled to the quality and privileges of admiral: he has the choice of his station, and the refusal of all the wood on the coast at his arrival. As fast as the masters arrive, they unrig all their vessels, leaving nothing but the throats to sustain the masts; and in the mean time the mates provide a tent on shore, covered with branches of trees, and falls over them, with a scaffold of great trunks of pines, 12, 15, 16, and often 20 feet high, commonly from 40 to 60 feet long, and about one-third as much in breadth. While the scaffold is preparing, the crew are a-fishing; and as fast as they catch, they bring their fish ashore, and open and salt them upon moveable benches; but the main salting is performed on the scaffold. When the fish have taken salt, they wash and hang them to drain on rails; when drained, they are laid on kinds of flages, which are small pieces of wood laid across, and covered with branches of trees, having the leaves stripped off for the passage of the air. On these flages, they are disposed, a fish thick, head against tail, with the back uppermost, and are turned carefully four times every 24 hours. When they begin to dry, they are laid in heaps 10 or 12 thick, in order to retain their warmth; and every day the heaps are enlarged till they become double their first bulk; then two heaps are joined together, which they turn every day as before: lastly, they are salted again, beginning with those first salted; and being laid in huge piles, they remain in that situation till they are carried on board the ships, where they are laid on the branches of trees disposed for that purpose, upon the ballast, and round the ship, with mats to prevent their contracting any moisture.\n\nThere are four sorts of commodities drawn from cod, viz. the founds, the tongues, the roes, and the oil extracted from the liver. The first is salted at the fishery together with the fish, and put in barrels from 600 to 700 pounds. The tongues are done in like manner, and brought in barrels from 400 to 500 pounds. The roes are also salted in barrels, and serve to cast into the sea to draw fish together, and particularly pilchards. The oil comes in barrels, from 400 to 520 pounds, and is used in dressing leather. In Scotland, they catch a small kind of cod on the coasts of Buchan, and all along the Murray frith on both sides; as also in the friths of Forth, Clyde, &c. which is much esteemed. They salt and dry them in the sun upon rocks, and sometimes in the chimney.\n\n3. Coral Fishery. See Coral.\n\n4. Herring\n4. Herring Fishery. Our great stations for this fishery are off the Shetland and Western Isles, and off the coast of Norfolk, in which the Dutch also share. There are two seasons for fishing herring; the first from June to the end of August; and the second in autumn, when the fogs become very favourable for this kind of fishing. The Dutch begin their herring fishing on the 24th of June, and employ a vast number of vessels therein, called buffles, being between 45 and 60 tons burden each, and carrying three or four small cannon. They never sail out of port, without a convoy, unless there be enough together to make about 18 or 20 cannon among them, in which case they are allowed to go in company. Before they go out they make a verbal agreement, which has the same force as if it were in writing. The regulations of the admiralty of Holland are partly followed by the French and other nations, and partly improved and augmented with new ones; as, that no fisher shall cast his net within 100 fathoms of another boat; that while the nets are cast, a light shall be kept on the hind part of the vessel; that when a boat is by any accident obliged to leave off fishing, the light shall be cast into the sea; that when the greater part of a fleet leaves off fishing, and casts anchor, the rest shall do the same, &c.\n\nMr Anderson gives to the Scots a knowledge of great antiquity in the herring fishery. He says that the Netherlanders resorted to these coasts as early as A.D. 836, to purchase salted fish of the natives, but, imposing on the strangers, they learned the art, and took up the trade, in after-times of such immense emolument to the Dutch.\n\nSir Walter Raleigh's observations on that head, extracted from the same author, are extremely worthy the attention of the curious, and excite reflections on the vast strength resulting from the wisdom of well-applied industry.\n\nIn 1603, he remarks, the Dutch sold to different nations as many herrings as amounted to \u00a31,759,000 sterling. In the year 1615, they at once sent out 2000 buffles, and employed in them 37,000 fishermen. In the year 1618, they sent out 3000 ships, with 50,000 men to take the herrings, and 9000 more ships to transport and sell the fish; which by sea and land employed 150,000 men, besides those first mentioned. All this wealth was gotten on our coasts, while our attention was taken up in a distant whale fishery.\n\nThe Scottish monarchs for a long time seemed to direct all their attention to the preservation of the salmon fishery, probably because their subjects were such novices in sea affairs. At length James III. endeavoured to stimulate his great men to these patriotic undertakings; for by an act of his third parliament, he compelled \"certain lords spiritual and temporal, and burrows, to make ships, buffles, and boats, with nets and other pertinents, for fishing.\" That the same should be made in each burgh; in number according to the substance of each burgh, and the least of them to be of twenty tons: and that all idle men be compelled by the sheriffs in the country to go on board the same.\"\n\nNumerous indeed have been the attempts made at different periods to secure this treasure to ourselves, but without success. In the late reign, a very strong effort was made, and bounties allowed for the encouragement of British adventurers: the first was of 30s. per ton to every baffle of 70 tons and upwards. This bounty was afterwards raised to 50s. per ton, to be paid to such adventurers as were entitled to it by claiming it at the places of rendezvous. The buffles are from 20 to 90 tons burden, but the best size is 80. A vessel of 80 tons ought to take ten lasts, or 120 barrels of herrings, to clear expenses, the price of the fish to be admitted to be a guinea a barrel. A ship of this size ought to have 18 men, and three boats: one of 20 tons should have six men; and every five tons above require an additional hand. To every ton are 280 yards of nets; so a vessel of 80 tons carries 20,000 square yards: each net is 12 yards long, and 10 deep, and every boat takes out from 20 to 30 nets, and puts them together, so as to form a long train; they are sunk at each end of the train by a stone, which weighs it down to the full extent: the top is supported by buoys, made of sheepskin, with a hollow stick at the mouth fastened tight: through this the skin is blown up, and then stopped with a peg, to prevent the escape of the air. Sometimes these buoys are placed at the top of the nets: at other times the nets are suffered to sink deeper, by the lengthening the cords fastened to them, every cord being for that purpose 10 or 12 fathoms long. But the best fisheries are generally in more shallow water.\n\nOf the Scots fishery in the Western Isles, the following account is given by Mr Pennant. \"The fishing is always performed in the night, unless by accident. The buffles remain at anchor, and send out their boats a little before sunset; which continue out, in winter and summer, till day light; often taking up and emptying their nets, which they do 10 or 12 times in a night, in case of good success. During winter it is a most dangerous and fatiguing employ, by reason of the greatness and frequency of the gales in these seas, and in such gales are the most successful captures: but by the Providence of heaven, the fishers are seldom lost; and, what is wonderful, few are visited with illness. They go out well prepared, with a warm great coat, boots, and skin aprons, and a good provision of beef and spirits. The same good fortune attends the buffles, which in the tempestuous season, and in the darkest nights, are continually shifting, in these narrow seas, from harbour to harbour. Sometimes 80 barrels of herrings are taken in a night by the boats of a single vessel. It once happened, in Loch Slappan, in Sky, that a baffle of 80 tons might have taken 200 barrels in one night, with 10,000 square yards of net; but the matter was obliged to desist, for want of a sufficient number of hands to preserve the capture. The herrings are preserved by salting; after the entrails are taken out. This last is an operation performed by the country people, who get three halfpence per barrel for their trouble; and sometimes, even in the winter, can gain fifteen pence a-day. This employs both women and children; but the salting is only intrusted to the crew of the buffles. The fish are laid on their backs in the barrels, and layers of salt between them. The entrails are not lost, for they are boiled into an oil: 8000 fish will yield ten gallons, valued at one shilling the gallon. A vessel of 80 tons takes out 144 barrels of salt; a drawback of 2s. 8d. is allowed for each barrel used by the foreign or Irish exportation of the fish; but there is a duty of 1s. per barrel for the home consumption, and the same...\"\nfor those sent to Ireland. The barrels are made of oak\nslaves chiefly from Virginia; the hoops from several\nparts of our own island, and are either of oak, birch,\nhazel or willow; the last from Holland, liable to a du-\nty. The barrels cost about 3s. each, they hold from\n500 to 800 fish, according to the size of the fish; and\nare made to contain 32 gallons. The barrels are in-\nspected by proper officers; a cooper examines if they\nare statutable and good; if faulty, he destroys them,\nand obliges the maker to stand to the loss.\n\n\"Loch Broom has been celebrated for three or four\ncenturies as the resort of herrings. They generally\nappear here in July; those that turn into this bay are\npart of the brigade that detaches itself from the west-\nern column of that great army which annually defers\nthe vast depths of the arctic circle, and comes, heaven-\ndirected, to the seats of population, offered as a cheap\nfood to millions, whom wasteful luxury or iron-hearted\navarice hath deprived, by enhancing the price, of the\nwonted supports of the poor. The migration of these\nfish from their northern retreat is regular; their visits\nto the Western isles and coasts certain; but their at-\ntachment to one particular loch extremely precarious.\nAll have their turns: that which swarmed with\nfish one year, is totally deserted the following; yet\nthe next loch to it may be crowded with the shoals.\nThese changes of place give often full employ to\nthe buffes, who are continually shifting their harbour\nin quest of news respecting these important wanderers.\nThey commonly appear here in July; the latter end\nof August they go into deep water, and continue\nthere for some time, without any apparent cause:\nin November, they return to the shallows, when a new\nfishery commences, which continues till January: at\nthat time the herrings become full of roe, and are use-\nful as articles of commerce. Some doubt, whether\nthese herrings that appear in November are not part\nof a new migration; for they are as fat, and make\nthe same appearance, as those that composed the first.\nThe signs of the arrival of the herrings are flocks of\ngulls, who catch up the fish while they skim on the\nsurface, and of gannets, who plunge and bring them\nup from considerable depths. Both these birds are\nclosely attended to by the fishers. Cod fish, haddock,\nand dog fish, follow the herrings in vast multitudes:\nthese voracious fish keep on the outsides of the col-\numns, and may be a concurrent reason of driving the\nshoals into bays and creeks. In summer, they come\ninto the bays generally with the warmest weather,\nand with easy gales. During winter, the hard gales\nfrom north-west are supposed to assist in forcing them\ninto shelter. East winds are very unfavourable to the\nfishery.\"\n\nHerrings are cured either white or pickled, or red.\n\nOf the fish, those done by the Dutch are the\nmost esteemed, being distinguished into four sorts, ac-\ncording to their sizes; and the best are those that are\nfat, flethy, firm, and white, salted the same day they\nare taken, with good salt, and well barrelled. The\nBritish cured herrings are little inferior, if not equal,\nto the Dutch: for in spite of all their endeavours to\nconceal the secret, their method of curing, lasting, or\ncalking the herrings, has been discovered, and is as\nfollows. After they have hauled in their nets, which\nthey drag in the stern of their vessels backwards\nforwards in traversing the coast, they throw them upon\nthe ship's deck, which is cleared of every thing for\nthat purpose: the crew is separated into sundry divi-\nsions, and each division has a peculiar task; one part\nopens and guts the herrings, leaving the milt and\nroes; another cures and salts them, by lining or rub-\nbing their inside with salt; the next packs them, and\nbetween each row and division they sprinkle handfuls\nof salt; lastly, the cooper puts the finishing hand to all,\nby heading the casks very tight, and flowing them in the\nhold.\n\nRed herrings must lie 24 hours in the brine, in-\nasmuch as they are to take all their salt there; and\nwhen they are taken out, they are spitted, that is,\nstrung by the head on little wooden spits, and then\nhung in a chimney made for that purpose. After\nwhich, a fire of brushwood, which yields a deal of\nsmoke, but no flame, being made under them, they\nremain there till sufficiently smoked and dried, and are\nafterwards barrelled up for keeping.\n\n5. Lobster Fishery. Lobsters are taken along the\nBritish channel, and on the coast of Norway, whence\nthey are brought to London for sale; and also in the\nfirth of Edinburgh, and on the coast of Northumber-\nland. By 10 and 11 W. III. cap. 24, no lobster is to\nbe taken under eight inches in length, from the peak\nof the nose to the end of the middle fin of the tail;\nand by 9 G. II. cap. 33, no lobsters are to be taken\non the coast of Scotland from the 1st of June to the\n1st of September.\n\n6. Mackerel Fishery. The mackerel is a summer fish\nof passage, found in large shoals, in divers parts of the\nocean, not far north; but especially on the French\nand English coasts. The fishing is usually in the\nmonths of April, May, and June, and even July, ac-\ncording to the place. They enter the English chan-\nnel in April, and proceed up to the straits of Dover\nas the summer advances; so that by June they are on\nthe coasts of Cornwall, Sussex, Normandy, Picardy,\n&c. where the fishery is most considerable. They are\nan excellent food fresh; and not to be despised, when\nwell prepared, pickled, and put up in barrels; a me-\nthod of preserving them chiefly used in Cornwall.\n\nThe fish is taken two ways; either with a line or\nnets: the latter is the more considerable, and is usually\nperformed in the night-time. The rules observed in\nthe fishing for mackerel are much the same as those\nalready mentioned in the fishery of herrings.\n\nThere are two ways of pickling them: the first is,\nby opening and gutting them, and filling the belly\nwith salt, crammed in as hard as possible with a stick;\nwhich done, they range them in strata or rows, at the\nbottom of the vessel, interweaving salt between the layers.\nIn the second way, they put them immediately into\ntubs full of brine, made of fresh water and salt; and\nleave them to steep, till they have imbibed salt enough\nto make them keep; after which, they are taken\nout, and barrelled up, taking care to press them close\ndown.\n\nMackerel are not cured or exported as merchandise,\nexcept a few by the Yarmouth and Leoftoff merchants,\nbut are generally consumed at home; especially in\nthe city of London, and the sea-ports between the\nThames and Yarmouth, east, and the Land's End of\nCornwall, west.\n7. Oyster Fishery. This fishery is principally carried on at Colchester in Essex; Feverham and Milton in Kent; the Isle of Wight; the Swales of the Medway; and Tenby on the coast of Wales. From Feverham, and adjacent parts, the Dutch have sometimes loaded a hundred large hoyes with oysters in a year. They are also taken in great quantities near Portsmouth, and in all the creeks and rivers between Southampton and Chichester: many of which are carried about by sea to London and to Colchester, to be fed in the pits about Wavenhoe and other places.\n\n8. Pearl Fishery. See Pearl, Conchology Index, and Ceylon.\n\n9. Pilchard Fishery. The chief pilchard fisheries are along the coasts of Dalmatia, on the coast of Bretagne, and along the coasts of Cornwall and Devonshire. That of Dalmatia is very plentiful: that on the coasts of Bretagne employs annually about 300 ships. Of the pilchard fishery on the coast of Cornwall the following account is given by Dr Borlase: \"It employs a great number of men on the sea, training them thereby to naval affairs; employs men, women, and children, on land, in salting, pressing, washing and cleaning; in making boats, nets, ropes, casks, and all the trades depending on their construction and sale. The poor are fed with the offals of the captures, the land with the refuse of the fish and salt; the merchant finds the gains of commission and honest commerce, the fisherman the gains of the fish. Ships are often freighted hither with salt, and into foreign countries with the fish, carrying off at the same time part of our tin. Of the usual produce of the great number of hogheads exported each year for ten years from 1747 to 1756 inclusive, from the four ports of Fowey, Falmouth, Penzance, and St Ives, it appears that Fowey has exported yearly 1732 hogheads; Falmouth, 14,631 hogheads and two thirds; Penzance and Mounts-Bay 12,149 hogheads and one third; St Ives, 1280 hogheads: in all amounting to 29,795 hogheads. Every hoghead for ten years last past, together with the bounty allowed for each hoghead exported, and the oil made out of each hoghead, has amounted, one year with another at an average, to the price of 1l. 13s. 3d.; so that the cash paid for pilchards exported has, at a medium, annually amounted to the sum of 49,532l. 10s.\"\u2014The numbers that are taken at one shooting out of the nets are amazingly great. Mr Pennant says, that Dr Borlase assured him, that on the 5th of October 1767, there were at one time enclosed in St Ives's Bay 7000 hogheads, each hoghead containing 35,000 fish, in all 245 millions.\n\nThe pilchards naturally follow the light, which contributes much to the facility of the fishery; the season is from June to September. On the coasts of France they make use of the roes of the cod fish as a bait; which, thrown into the sea, makes them rise from the bottom, and run into the nets. On our coasts there are persons posted ashore, who, spying by the colour of the water where the shoals are, make signs to the boats to go among them to cast their nets. When taken, they are brought on shore to a warehouse, where they are laid up in broad piles, supported with backs and sides; and as they are piled, they salt them with bay salt; in which lying to soak for 30 or 40 days, they run out a deal of blood, with dirty pickle and bitters; then they wash them clean in sea water; and, when dry, barrel and press them hard down to squeeze out the oil, which issues out at a hole in the bottom of the casks.\n\n10. Salmon Fishery. The chief salmon fisheries in Europe are in England, Scotland, and Ireland, in the rivers, and sea coasts adjoining to the river mouths. The most distinguished for salmon in Scotland are, the river Tweed, the Clyde, the Tay, the Dee, the Don, the Spey, the Ness, the Bewly, &c. in most of which it is very common, about the height of summer, especially if the weather happens to be very hot, to catch four or five score salmon at a draught. The chief rivers in England for salmon are, the Tyne, the Trent, the Severn, and the Thames. The fishing is performed with nets, and sometimes with a kind of locks or weirs made on purpose, which in certain places have iron or wooden grates disposed, in an angle, that being impelled by any force in a contrary direction to the course of the river, they may give way and open a little at the point of contact, and immediately shut again, closing the angle. The salmon, therefore, coming up into the rivers, are admitted into these grates, which open, and suffer them to pass through, but shut again, and prevent their return. The salmon is also caught with a spear, which they dart into him when they see him swimming near the surface of the water. It is customary likewise to catch them with a candle and lanthorn, or wisp of straw set on fire; for the fish naturally following the light, are struck with the spear, or taken in a net spread for that purpose, and lifted with a sudden jerk from the bottom.\n\n\"The capture of salmon in the Tweed, about the month of July (says Mr Pennant) is prodigious. In a good fishery, often a boat load, and sometimes near two, are taken in a tide: some few years ago there were above 700 fish taken at one haul, but from 50 to 100 is very frequent. The cooperers in Berwick then begin to talt both salmon and grilles in pipes and other large vessels, and afterwards barrel them to send abroad, having then far more than the London markets can take off their hands.\n\n\"Most of the salmon taken before April, or to the setting in of the warm weather, is sent fresh to London in balkets: unless now and then the vessel is disappointed by contrary winds of failing immediately; in which case the fish is brought ashore again to the cooper's offices, and boiled, pickled, and kitted, and sent to the London markets by the same ship, and fresh salmon put in the balkets in lieu of the stale ones. At the beginning of the season, when a ship is on the point of failing, a fresh clean salmon will fall from a shilling to eighteen pence a pound; and most of the time that this part of the trade is carried on, the prices are from five to nine shillings per stone; the value rising and falling according to the plenty of fish, or the prospect of a fair or foul wind. Some fish are sent in this manner to London the latter end of September, when the weather grows cool; but then the fish are full of large roes, grow very thin bellied, and are not esteemed either palatable or wholesome.\n\n\"The season for fishing in the Tweed begins November 3rd, but the fishermen work very little till after Christmas: it ends on Michaelmas day; yet the corporation of Berwick (who are conservators of the river)\nThere are on the river 41 considerable fisheries, extending upwards about 14 miles from the mouth, (the others above being of no great value), which are rented for near \u00a3500l. per annum; the expense attending the servants wages, nets, boats, &c. amount to \u00a3500l. more; which together makes up the sum \u00a310,500l. Now, in consequence, the produce must defray all, and no less than 20 times that sum of fish will effect it; so that 208,000 salmon must be caught there one year with another.\n\nScotland possesses great numbers of fine fisheries on both sides of that kingdom. The Scotch in early times had most severe laws against the killing of this fish; for the third offence was made capital, by a law of James IV. Before that, the offender had power to redeem his life. They were thought in the time of Henry VI. a present worthy of a crowned head; for in that reign the queen of Scotland sent to the duchess of Clarence 10 casks of salted salmon; which Henry directed to pass duty free. The salmon are cured in the same manner as at Berwick, and a great quantity is sent to London in the spring; but after that time, the adventurers begin to barrel and export them to foreign countries; but we believe that commerce is far less lucrative than it was in former times, partly owing to the great increase of the Newfoundland fishery, and partly to the general relaxation of the discipline of abstinence in the Roman church.\n\nIreland (particularly the north) abounds with this fish; the most considerable fishery is at Cranna, on the river Ban, about a mile and a half from Coleraine. When I made the tour of that hospitable kingdom in 1754, it was rented by a neighbouring gentleman for \u00a360l. a-year; who assured me, that the tenant, his predecessor, gave \u00a3600l. per annum, and was a much greater gainer by the bargain, for the reasons before mentioned, and on account of the number of the poachers who destroy the fish in the fence months.\n\nThe mouth of this river faces the north; and is finely situated to receive the fish that roam along the coast in search of an inlet into some fresh water, as they do all along that end of the kingdom which opposes itself to the northern ocean. We have seen near Ballincastle, nets placed in the sea at the foot of the promontories that jut into it, which the salmon strike into as they are wandering close to shore; and numbers are taken by that method.\n\nIn the Ban they fish with nets 18 score yards long, and are continually drawing night and day the whole season, which we think lasts about four months, two sets of 16 men each alternately relieving one another. The best drawing is when the tide is coming in: we were told, that at a single draught there were once 840 fish taken.\n\nA few miles higher up the river is a wear where a considerable number of fish that escape the nets are taken. We were lately informed, that, in the year 1760, about 320 tons were taken in the Cranna fishery.\n\nCuring Salmon. When the salmon are taken, they open them along the back, take out the guts and gills, and cut out the greatest part of the bones, endeavouring to make the inside as smooth as possible: they then salt the fish in large tubs for the purpose, where they lie a considerable time soaking in brine; and about October, they are packed close up in barrels, and sent to London, or exported up the Mediterranean. They have also in Scotland a great deal of salmon salted in the common way, which after soaking in brine a competent time, is well pressed, and then dried in smoke: this is called kipper, and is chiefly made for home consumption; and if properly cured and prepared, is reckoned very delicious.\n\nSturgeon Fishery. The greatest sturgeon fishery is in the mouth of the Volga, on the Caspian sea; where the Muscovites employ a great number of hands, and catch them in a kind of enclosure, formed by huge stakes representing the letter Z repeated several times. These fisheries are open on the side next the sea, and close on the other; by which means the fish ascending in its course up the river, is embarrassed in these narrow angular retreats, and is easily killed with a harping iron. Sturgeons, when fresh, eat deliciously; and in order to make them keep, they are salted or pickled in large pieces, and put up in casks from 30 to 50 pounds. But the great object of this fishery is the roe, of which the Muscovites are extremely fond, and of which is made the caviar, or kavia, so much esteemed by the Italians.\n\nTunny Fishery. The tunny (a species of Scomber), was a fish well known to the ancients, and made a great article of commerce: And there are still very considerable tunny fisheries on the coasts of Sicily, as well as several other parts of the Mediterranean.\n\nThe nets are spread over a large space of sea by means of cables fastened to anchors, and are divided into several compartments. The entrance is always directed, according to the season, towards that part of the sea from which the fish are known to come. A man placed upon the summit of a rock high above the water, gives a signal of the fish being arrived; for he can discern from that elevation what passes under the waters infinitely better than any person nearer the surface. As soon as notice is given that the shoal of fish has penetrated as far as the inner compartment, or the chamber of death, the netting is drawn close, and the slaughter begins.\n\nThe undertakers of these fisheries pay an acknowledgment to the king, or the lord upon whose land they fix the main stay or foot of the tonnare; they make the best bargain they can: and, till success has crowned their endeavours, obtain this leave for a small consideration; but the rent is afterwards raised in proportion to their capture.\n\nThe tunny enters the Mediterranean about the vernal equinox, travelling in a triangular phalanx, so as to cut the waters with its point, and to present an extensive base for the tides and currents to act against, and impel forwards. These fish repair to the warm seas of Greece to spawn, steering their course thither along the European shores, but as they return, approach the African coast; the young fry is placed in the van of the squadron as they travel. They come back from the east in May, and abound on the coast of Sicily and Calabria about that time. In autumn they steer northward, and frequent the neighbourhood of Amalfi and Naples; but during the whole season stragglers are occasionally caught.\nWhen taken in May, the usual time of their appearance in the Calabrian bays, they are full of spawn, and their flesh is then esteemed unwholesome, apt to occasion headaches and vapours; the milts and roes are particularly so at that season. To prevent these bad effects, the natives fry them in oil, and afterwards salt them. The quantity of this fish consumed annually in the Two Sicilies almost exceeds the bounds of calculation. From the beginning of May to the end of October it is eaten fresh, and all the rest of the year it is in use salted. The most delicate part is the muzzle. The belly salted was called tarantallum, and accounted a great delicacy by the Romans; its present name is Surra. The rest of the body is cut into slices, and put into tubs.\n\nTurbot Fishery. Turbots grow to a large size, some of them weighing from 23 to 30 pounds. They are taken chiefly off the north coast of England, and others off the Dutch coast. The large turbot (as well as several other kinds of flat fish) are taken by the hook and line, for they lie in deep water; the method of taking them in weirs or flaked nets being very precarious. When the fishermen go out to fish, each person is provided with three lines, which are coiled on a flat oblong piece of wicker work; the hooks being baited, and placed regularly in the centre of the coil. Each line is furnished with 14 score of hooks, at the distance of six feet two inches from each other. The hooks are fastened to the lines upon heads of twisted horse hair 27 inches in length. When fishing, there are always three men in each coble, and consequently nine of these lines are fastened together, and used in one line, extending in length near three miles, and furnished with 2520 hooks. An anchor and a buoy are fixed at the first end of the line, and one more of each at the end of each man's lines; in all four anchors, which are common perforated stones, and four buoys made of leather or cork. The line is always laid across the current. The tides of flood and ebb continue an equal time upon our coast, and, when undisturbed by winds, run each way about six hours; they are so rapid that the fishermen can only throw and haul their lines at the turn of tide, and therefore the lines always remain upon the ground about six hours; during which time the myxine glutinosa of Linnaeus will frequently penetrate the fish that are on the hooks, and entirely devour them, leaving only the skin and bones. The same rapidity of tides prevents their using hand lines; and therefore two of the people commonly wrap themselves in the sail, and sleep while the other keeps a strict look-out, for fear of being run down by ships, and to observe the weather. For storms often rise so suddenly, that it is with extreme difficulty they can sometimes escape to the shore, leaving their lines behind.\n\nBesides the coble, the fishermen have also a five men boat, which is 40 feet long and 15 broad, and 25 tons burden; it is so called, though navigated by five men and a boy, because one of the men is commonly hired to cook, &c., and does not share in the profits with the other five. This boat is decked at each end, but open in the middle, and has two large lug sails. All our able fishermen go in these boats to the herring fishery at Yarmouth in the latter end of September, and return about the middle of November. The boats are then laid up till the beginning of Lent, at which time they go off in them to the edge of the Dogger, and other places, to fish for turbot, cod, ling, skates, &c. They always take two cobs on board; and when they come upon their ground, anchor the boat, throw out the cobs, and fish in the same manner as those who go from the shore in a coble; with this difference only, that here each man is provided with double the quantity of lines, and instead of waiting the return of the tide in the coble, return to their boat and bait their other lines; thus hauling one net and shooting another every turn of tide. They commonly run into harbour twice a week to deliver their fish.\n\nThe best bait is fresh herring cut in pieces of a proper size; the five men boats are always furnished with nets for taking them. Next to herrings are the lesser lampreys. The next baits in esteem are small haddock cut in pieces, sand worms, and limpets, here called fiddlers; and when none of these can be had, they use bullock's liver. The hooks are two inches and a half long in the shank, and near an inch wide between the shank and the point. The line is made of small cording, and is always tanned before it is used.\n\nTurbots are extremely delicate in their choice of baits; for if a piece of herring or haddock has been 12 hours out of the sea, and then used as bait, they will not touch it.\n\nWhale Fishery. See Bal\u00e6na, Cetology Index.\n\nWhales are chiefly caught in the north seas; the largest sort are found about Greenland or Spitzbergen. At the first discovery of this country, whales not being used to be disturbed, frequently came into the very bays, and were accordingly killed almost close to the shore; so that the blubber being cut off was immediately boiled into oil on the spot. The ships in those times took in nothing but the pure oil and the whalebone, and all the butinels was executed in the country; by which means a ship could bring home the product of many more whales than she can, according to the present method of conducting this trade. The fishery also was then so plentiful, that they were obliged sometimes to send other ships to fetch off the oil they had made, the quantity being more than the fishing ships could bring away. But time and change of circumstances have shifted the situation of this trade. The ships coming in such numbers from Holland, Denmark, Hamburgh, and other northern countries, all intruders upon the English, who were the first discoverers of Greenland, the whales were disturbed, and gradually, as other fish often do, forsaking the place, were not to be killed so near the shore as before; but are now found, and have been so ever since, in the openings and spaces among the ice, where they have deep water, and where they go sometimes a great many leagues from the shore.\n\nThe whale fishery begins in May, and continues all June and July; but whether the ships have good or bad success, they must come away, and get clear of the ice, by the end of August; so that in the month of September at farthest they may be expected home; but a ship that meets with a fortunate and early fishery in May may return in June or July.\n\nBut, for the manner of taking whales, and for a farther account of the whale fishery, as a trade, see Cetology.","sp":271,"ep":278},{"h":"FISHGARD","t":"or FISGARD, a town of Pembroke-shire, situated on a steep cliff on the sea-shore, 254 miles from","sp":278,"ep":278},{"h":"FISHING","t":"in general, the art of catching fish, whether by means of nets, of spears, or of the line and hook.\n\nFISHING in the great, performed by the net, spear, or harpoon, for fish that go in shoals, has been explained in the preceding article. That performed by the rod, line, and hook, for solitary fish, is usually termed ANGLING: See that article; and for the particular manner of angling for the different kinds of fish, see their respective names, as DACE, EEL, PERCH, under ICHTHYOLOGY.\n\nHere we shall give an account of the following:\n\n1. The Barbel, so called on account of the barb or beard that is under his chops), though a coarse fish, gives considerable exercise to the angler's ingenuity. They swim together in great shoals, and are at their worst in April, at which time they spawn, but come soon in season; the places whither they chiefly resort, are such as are weedy and gravelly rising grounds, in which this fish is said to dig and root with his nose like a swine. In the summer he frequents the strongest, swiftest, currents of water; as deep bridges, weirs, &c., and is apt to settle himself among the piles, hollow places, and mows, or weeds; and will remain there immoveable; but in the winter he retires into deep waters, and helps the female to make a hole in the sands to hide her spawn in, to hinder its being devoured by other fish. He is a very curious and cunning fish; for if his baits be not sweet, clean, well scoured, and kept in sweet mows, he will not bite; but well ordered and curiously kept, he will bite with great eagerness. The best bait for him is the spawn of a salmon, trout, or any other fish; and if you would have good sport with him, bait the places where you intend to fish with it a night or two before, or with large worms cut in pieces; and the earlier in the morning or the later in the evening that you fish, the better it will be. Your rod and line must be both strong and long, with a running plummet on the line; and let a little bit of lead be placed a foot or more above the hook, to keep the bullet from falling on it; so the worm will be at the bottom, where they always bite; and when the fish takes the bait, your plummet will rise and not choke him. By the bending of your rod you may know when he bites, as also with your hand you will feel him make a strong snatch; then strike, and you will rarely fail, if you play him well; but if you manage him not dexterously, he will break your line. The best time for fishing is about nine in the morning, and the most proper season is the latter end of May, June, July, and the beginning of August.\n\n2. The Bleak, is an eager fish, caught with all sorts of worms bred on trees or plants; as also with flies, paste, sheep's blood, &c. They may be angled for with half a score of hooks at once, if they can be all fastened on; he will also in the evening take a natural or artificial fly. If the day be warm and clear, there is no fly so good for him as the small fly at the top of the water, which he will take at any time of the day, especially in the evening; but if the day is cold and cloudy, gentles and caddis are the best; about two feet under water. No fish yields better sport to a young angler than the bleak. It is so eager, that it will leap out of the water for a bait.\n\nThere is another way of taking bleak, which is by whipping them in a boat, or on a bank side in fresh water in a summer's evening, with a hazel top about five or six feet long and a line twice the length of the rod. But the best method is with a drabble, thus: Tie eight or ten small hooks across a line two inches above one another; the biggest hook the lowermost, (whereby you may sometimes take a better fish), and bait them with gentles, flies, or some small red worms, by which means you may take half a dozen or more at a time.\n\n3. For the Bream, observe the following directions, which will also be of use in carp fishing.\u2014Procure about prins, i.e., a quart of large red worms; put them into fresh mows, well washed and dried every three or four days, feeding them with fat mould and chopped fennel, and they will be thoroughly scoured in about three weeks.\n\nLet your lines be silk and hair, but all silk is the best; let the floats be either swan-quills or goose-quills. Let your plumb be a piece of lead in the shape of a pear, with a small ring at the little end of it; fasten the lead to the line, and the line hook to the lead, about ten or twelve inches space between lead and hook will be enough; and take care the lead be heavy enough to sink the float. Having baited your hook well with a strong worm, the worm will draw the hook up and down in the bottom, which will provoke the bream to bite the more eagerly. It will be best to fit up three or four rods and lines in this manner, and let them as will be directed, and this will afford you much the better sport. Find the exact depth of the water if possible, that your float may swim on its surface directly over the lead; then provide the following ground bait. Take about a peck of sweet grofs-ground malt; and having boiled it a very little, strain it hard through a bag, and carry it to the water side where you have founded; and in the place where you suppose the fish frequent, there throw in the malt by handfuls squeezed hard together, that the stream may not separate it before it comes to the bottom; and be sure to throw it in at least a yard above the place where you intend the hook shall lie, otherwise the stream will carry it down too far. Do this about nine o'clock at night, keeping some of the malt in the bag, and go to the place about three the next morning; but approach very warily, lest you should be seen by the fish; for it is certain that they have their sentinels watching on the top of the water, while the rest are feeding below. Having baited your hook so that the worm may crawl to and fro, the better to allure the fish to bite, cast it in at the place where you find the fish to stay most, which is generally in the broadest and deepest part of the river, and so that it may rest about the midst of your bait that is on the ground. Cast in your second line so that it may rest a yard above that, and a third about a yard below it. Let your rods lie on the bank with some stones to keep them down at the great ends; and then withdraw yourself, yet not so far but that you can have your eye upon\nFishing.\n\nupon all the floats; and when you see one bitten and carried away, do not be too hasty to run in, but give time to the fish to tire himself, and then touch him gently. When you perceive the float link, creep to the water side, and give it as much line as you can. If it is a bream or carp, they will run to the other side; which strike gently, and hold your rod at a bent a little while; but do not pull, for then you will spoil all; but you must first tire them before they can be landed, for they are very fly. If there are any carps in the river, it is an even wager that you take one or more of them; but if there are any pike or perch, they will be sure to visit the ground bait, though they will not touch it, being drawn thither by the great resort of the small fish; and until you remove them, it is in vain to think of taking the bream or carp. In this case, bait one of your hooks with a small bleak, roach, or gudgeon, about two feet deep from your float, with a little red worm at the point of your hook; and if a pike be there, he will be sure to snap at it. This sport is good till nine o'clock in the morning; and, in a gloomy day, till night; but do not frequent the place too much, lest the fish grow fly.\n\n4. The carp +. A person who angles for carp must arm himself with abundance of patience, because of its extraordinary subtlety and policy; they always choose to lie in the deepest places, either of ponds or rivers, where there is but a small running stream.\n\nFurther, observe, that they will seldom bite in cold weather; and you cannot be too early or too late at the spot in hot weather; and if he bite, you need not fear his hold; for he is one of those leather-mouthed fish that have their teeth in their throat.\n\nNeither must you forget, in angling for him, to have a strong rod and line; and since he is so very wary, it will be proper to entice him, by baiting the ground with a coarse paste.\n\nHe seldom refuses the red worm in March, the caddis in June, or the grasshopper in June, April, and September.\n\nThis fish does not only delight in worms, but also in sweet paste; of which there is great variety; the best is made of honey and sugar, and ought to be thrown into the water some hours before you begin to angle; neither will small pellets thrown into the water two or three days before be worse for this purpose, especially if chickens' guts, garbage, or blood mixed with bran and cow dung, be also thrown in.\n\nBut more particularly, as to a paste very proper for this use, you may make it in the manner following: Take a sufficient quantity of flour, and mingle it with veal, cut small, making it up with a compound of honey; then pound all together in a mortar till they are so tough as to hang upon the hook without wailing off. In order to effect which the better, mingle whitish wool with it; and if you keep it all the year round, add some virgin wax and clarified honey.\n\nAgain, If you fish with gentles, anoint them with honey, and put them on your hook, with a deep scarlet dipped in the like, which is a good way to deceive the fish.\n\nHoney and crumbs of wheat bread, mixed together, make also a very good paste.\n\nIn taking a carp either in pond or river, if the angler intends to add profit to his pleasure, he must take a peck of ale-grains, and a good quantity of any blood to mix with the grains, baiting the ground with it where he intends to angle. This food will wonderfully attract the feafe-fills, as carp, tench, roach, dace, and bream.\n\nLet him angle in a morning, plumbing his ground, and angling for carp with a strong line: the bait must be either paste or a knotted red worm; and by this means he will have sport enough.\n\nDescription of proper Baits for the several sorts of Fish referred to in the annexed Table.\n\nFlies.]\n1.

See Fishing.\n\nThe fly is either natural or artificial.\n\nI. Natural flies are innumerable. The more usual for this purpose are mentioned in the preceding page.\n\nThere are two ways to fish with natural flies; either on the surface of the water, or a little underneath it.\n\nIn angling for chub, roach, or dace, move not your natural fly swiftly when you see the fish make at it; but rather let it glide freely towards him with the stream; but if it be in a still and slow water, draw the fly slowly sidewise by him, which will make him eagerly pursue.\n\nII. The artificial fly is seldom used but in blustering weather, when the waters are so troubled by the winds, that the natural fly cannot be seen, nor rest upon them. Of this artificial fly there are reckoned no less than 12 sorts, of which the following are the principal.\n\n1. For March, the dun fly; made of dun wool, and the feathers of the partridge's wing; or the body made of black wool, and the feathers of a black drake. 2. For April, the stone fly; the body made of black wool, dyed yellow under the wings and tail. 3. For the beginning of May, the ruddy fly; made of red wool, and bound about with black silk, with the feathers of a black capon hanging dangling on his sides next his tail. 4. For June, the greenish fly; the body made of black wool, with a yellow list on either side, the wings taken off the wings of a buzzard, bound with black broken hemp. 5. The moorish fly, the body made of darkish wool, and the wings of the blackfish mail of a drake. 6. The tawny fly, good till the middle of June; the body made of tawny wool, the wings made contrary one against the other of the whitish mail of a white drake. 7. For July, the wasp fly; the body made of black wool, cast about with yellow silk, and the wings of drakes feathers. 8. The steel fly; good in the middle of July; the body made with greenish wool, cast about with the feathers of a peacock's tail, and the wings made of those of the buzzard. 9. For August, the drake fly; the body made with black wool cast about with black silk; his wings of the mail of a black drake, with a black head.\n\nThe best rules for artificial fly fishing are,\n\n1. To fish in a river somewhat disturbed with rain; or in a cloudy day, when the waters are moved by a gentle breeze; the fourth wind is best; and if the wind blow high, yet not so but that you may conveniently guard your tackle, the fish will rise in plain deeps; but if the wind be small, the best angling is in swift streams.\n\n2. Keep as far from the water side as may be; fish down the stream with the sun at your back, and touch not the water with your line. 3. Ever angle in clear rivers, with a small fly and slender wings; but in muddy places, use a larger. 4. When, after rain, the water becomes brownish, use an orange fly; in a clear day, a light-colored fly; a dark fly for dark waters, &c. 5. Let the line be twice as long as the rod, unless the river be encumbered with wood. 6. For every sort of fly, have several of the same differing in colour, to suit with the different complexions of several waters and weathers. 7. Have a nimble eye, and active hand, to strike presently with the rising of the fish; or else he will be apt to spue out the hook. 8. Let the fly fall first into the water, and not the line, which will scare the fish. 9. In slow rivers, or still places, cast the fly across the river, and let it sink a little in the water, and draw it gently back with the current.\n\nSalmon flies should be made with their wings standing one behind the other, whether two or four. This fish delights in the gaudiest colours that can be; chiefly in the wings, which must be long, as well as the tail.","sp":278,"ep":281},{"h":"FISHING BY","t":"g by means of birds, a method peculiar to the Chinese, who train certain birds for the purpose in the same manner as falcons are taught to pursue game. For this purpose they have trained a species of pelican, resembling the common corvornant, which they call the Lew-tze, or fishing bird. Sir George Staunton, who, when the embassy was proceeding on the southern branch of the great canal, saw those birds employed, tells us, that on a large lake, close to the east side of the canal, are thousands of small boats and rafts, built entirely for this species of fishery. On each boat or raft are ten or a dozen birds, which, at a signal from the owner, plunge into the water; and it is astonishing to see the enormous size of fish with which they return, grasped within their bills. They appeared to be so well trained, that it did not require either ring or cord about their throats to prevent them from swallowing any portion of their prey, except what their master was pleased to return to them for encouragement and food. The boat used by these fishermen is of a remarkable light make, and is often carried to the lake, together with the fishing birds, by the men who are there to be supported by it.\n\nThe same author saw the fishermen busy on the great lake Wee-chaung-hee; and he gives the following account of a very singular method practised by them for catching the fish of the lake without the aid of birds, of net, or of hooks. To one side of a boat a flat board, painted white, is fixed, at an angle of about 45 degrees, the edge inclining towards the water. On moonlight nights the boat is so placed that the painted board is turned to the moon, from whence the rays of light striking on the whitened surface, give to it the appearance of moving water; on which the fish being tempted to leap as on their element, the boatmen raising with a string the board, turn the fish into the boat.\n\nWater-fowl are much sought after by the Chinese, and are taken upon the same lake by the following ingenious device. Empty jars or gourds are suffered to float about upon the water, that such objects may become familiar to the birds. The fisherman then wades into the lake with one of those empty vessels upon his head, and walks gently towards a bird; and lifting up his arm, draws it down below the surface of the water without any disturbance or giving alarm to the rest, several of whom he treats in the same manner, until he fills the bag he had brought to hold his prey. The contrivance itself is not so singular, as it is that the same exactly should have occurred in the new continent, as\nAn Epitome of the whole art of **Fishing**, wherein is shown (at one view), the harbours, seasons, and depths, for catching all sorts of fish usually angled for; also the various baits for each, so digested as to contain the essence of all the treatises ever written on the subject, exempt from the superfluities, which tend more to perplex than instruct.\n\n| Names        | Where found                                      | Season          | Time to ang.    | Depth from ground |\n|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Bream        | Rough str. river or mid. pond                   | Apr. to Mich.   | Sunrise to 9 Sun set | Touch ground     |\n| Barbel       | Gravel banks in currents under bridges         | Apr. to Aug.    | Very early or late | Ditto             |\n| Bleak        | Sandy bottom, deep rivers                       | May to Oct.     | All day         | Six inches from bottom |\n| Carp         | Still deep mud bottom, pond or river            | May to Aug.     | Sunrise to 9 Sun set | Three inches from bottom |\n| Chub or Chevin | Ditto                                           | May to Dec.     | Ditto            | Mid water        |\n| Dace         | Sandy bottom deep rivers, ships sterns          | May to Oc.      | All day         | Six to 12 inches from bottom |\n| Gudgeon Pike | Gravel shoals                                    | May to Oc.      | Ditto            | Near or on the ground |\n| Perch        | River in stream                                 | May to Aug.     | Sunrise to 10 Sun set | Ditto             |\n| Pope         | Deep holes in rivers                             | Aug. to May     | Mid day         | Six inches from bottom |\n| Roach        | Sandy bottom, deep rivers                       | May to Oc.      | Ditto            | Six to 12 inches |\n| Salmon       | Deep rivers                                     | Mar. to Sept.   | 8 to 9, 3 to 6   | Mid way to the bottom |\n| Smelts       | Ships sterns and docks                           | Apr. to Oc.     | All day         | Mid way to the bottom Variable |\n| Trout        | Purling stream and eddies of stony bottom river | Mar. to Mich.   | Ditto            | Cold weather, 6 inches to 9 Hot weather, top to mid wat. |\n| Tench        | Mud bottom river or pond                         | All the year.   | Sunrise to 9 Sun set | Cold wea., 3 inches from bot. |\n| Umber or Grayling | Clay bottom, swift stream                      | All the year.   | All day         | Cold weather, 6 to 9 inches Hot weather, top to mid wat. |\n\n| Proper Baits |\n|--------------|\n| Flies.

Of these there are divers kinds, some made of Mulcory cluck quills, which are the bait for the thank, yet somewhat thick in the circumference; flow waters; but for fishing flames, found cork, wimple, made of fluffs or holes, bored through with a hot iron, minus.\nFor setting the hook on, use strong but small silk, laying the hair on the inside of your hook; for if it be on the outside, the silk will fret and cut it asunder.\n\nThere are several sizes of these fishing hooks, some big, some little; and of these, some have peculiar names; as, 1. Single hooks. 2. Double hooks; which have two bendings, one contrary to the other. 3. Snappers, or gorgers, which are the hooks to whip the artificial fly upon, or bait with the natural fly. 4. Springers, or spring hooks; a kind of double hooks, with a spring, which flies open upon being struck into any fish, and so keeps its mouth open.\n\nFishing-Line, is either made of hair twisted; or silk; or the Indian grass. The best colours are the sotrel, white, and gray; the two last for clear waters, the first for muddy ones. Nor is the pale watery green desirable; this colour is given artificially, by steeping the hair in a liquor made of alum, root, and the juice of walnut leaves, boiled together.\n\nFishing-Rod, a long slender rod or wand, to which the line is fastened, for angling.\u2014Of these there are several sorts; as, 1. A troller, or trolling rod, which has a ring at the end of the rod, for the line to go through when it runs off a reel. 2. A whipper, or whipping rod; a top rod, that is weak in the middle, and top heavy, but all slender and fine. 3. A dropper; which is a strong rod and very light. 4. A snapper, or snap rod; which is a strong pole, peculiarly used for the pike. 5. A bottom rod; being the same as the dropper, but somewhat more pliable. 6. A frizzling or procking stick; a forked stick, having a short strong line, with a needle, baited with a lob worm: this is only for eels in their holes.\n\nFishing-Frog, or Angler. See Lophius.\n\nRight of Fishing, and property of fish. It has been held, that where the lord of the manor hath the foil on both sides of the river, it is a good evidence that he hath a right of fishing; and it puts the proof upon him who claims liberam piscariam: but where a river ebbs and flows, and is an arm of the sea, there it is common to all, and he who claims a privilege to himself must prove it; for if the trespass is brought for fishing there, the defendant may justify, that the place where is brachium maris, in quo unumquique fidelibus domini regis habet et habere debet liberam piscariam. In the Severn the foil belongs to the owner of the land on each side; and the foil of the river Thames is in the king, but the fishing is common to all. He who is owner of the foil of a private river, hath separatis piscaria; and he that hath libera piscaria, hath a property in the fish, and may bring a possession action for them; but communis piscaria is like the case of all other commons. One that has a clove pond in which there are fish, may call them piscis suos, in an indictment, &c. but he cannot call them bona et catalla, if they be not in trunks. There needs no privilege to make a fish pond, as there doth in the case of a warren.

He received the rudiments of his education in the monastery of Kremnitz, of which his uncle Alexander was abbot. Here he studied during five years, and delighted so much in drawing straight and curved figures, that his mother called him the *almanack-maker.* He went afterward to Salzburg, where he studied a regular course of philosophy, and particularly turned his attention to mathematics under a professor Stuard, whose method of teaching that science was truly extraordinary, as he never made use of any figures, and yet conveyed such a clear idea of every proposition as made it perfectly easy. He was admitted as a novice into Kremnitz in 1737, and the next year he took the solemn vow in presence of his uncle. After being two years in this monastery, during which time he devoted every leisure hour to the study of mathematics and philosophy, he went to Salzburg to finish his studies in divinity and jurisprudence, acquiring at that time a competent knowledge of oriental and modern languages, history and antiquities. In the year 1745, he obtained the degree of D.D., after which he received priest's orders in his own monastery, and was created professor of ecclesiastical law, which office he held for 40 years, discharging the duties belonging to it till within a few days of his death. He was also chosen dean of the higher schools, and regent of the young nobility, which he retained during life.\n\nHe wrote a commentary on the *Jus Canonicum,* notwithstanding his extensive epistolary correspondence, and the management of the whole business of the monastery; but this work was never published. He was, by the intrigues of his friends, induced to publish his *Reipublicae sacrae origines divinae, seu Ecclesiae Christi exterior junctura, imperium, et hierarchia, ex primigenia ejus institutione eruta et demonstrata.* His commendable diligence procured him universal esteem, but it was his knowledge of astronomy which rendered him illustrious. His uncle Alexander fitted up an apartment for containing the instruments necessary for the dissemination of mathematical knowledge, and he also erected an observatory, which was begun in 1748, and completed in 1758, under the direction of Anhelm Dering of Emstorf, a celebrated architect. While the observatory was building, Fixmillner led a life of retirement and severe study; his favourite subject during these ten years being astronomy. When it was finished, one Dobler, a celebrated mathematician, was appointed first astronomer; but the successors of Fixmillner's uncle having discovered his extensive mathematical knowledge, made him an offer of the astronomical department, and the sole direction of the observatory: This place he accepted in the year 1762, still retaining his chair as professor of ecclesiastical law. He was not yet master of the learning which practical astronomy requires, to remedy which defect he attentively perused Lalande's *Exposition du Calcul Astronomique,* soon after which he obtained the large astronomical work of the same great man, and in 1766 he published his *Meridianus Specul\u00e6 Astronomic\u00e6 Cremifanensis,* by which he acquired considerable reputation. Ten years after this period he gave the world his *Decennium Astronomicum,* containing many curious and important particulars respecting the theory and practice of astronomy. His *Acta Astronomic\u00e6 Cremifanensis,* which did not appear till after his decease, still farther increased his astronomical reputation; and he was a large contributor to many periodical publications in different countries.\n\nHe made and collected a number of observations of the planet Mercury, which were at that period both scarce and difficult, the importance of which was publicly acknowledged by Lalande, as they greatly assisted him in constructing his tables of that planet. Fixmillner was one of the first astronomers who calculated the orbit of the new planet Uranus (Georgium Sidus), and his tables reflecting it may be seen in the Berlin almanack for 1789. He also proved the truth of what was formerly conjecture, that the 34th star of Taurus, which Flamsteed observed in 1690, was the new planet. It may be said of most philosophers, that they observe a great\ngreat deal, and calculate little, but the conduct of Fixmillner was exactly the reverse. He turned his attention to the observation of the solar spots more than any of his predecessors, which he noticed in the years 1767, 1776, 1777, 1778, and 1782, from which he deduced important inferences respecting the revolution of the sun on its axis.\n\nHe had a genius uncommonly adapted to the study of mechanics, by which he was enabled to invent a new micrometer, and a machine for grinding concentric circles. As an additional proof of his profound inventive genius, he resided in the country, by which means he was in a great measure deprived of literary affluence, yet to the very close of life he was a singular instance of the most indefatigable zeal, diligence, and perseverance. He was little subject to the influence of the turbulent passions;\u2014perhaps less so than most other men. Like the laws of nature which it was his chief delight to study, he was simple, uniform, and constant; and such were the mildness and integrity of his character, that he could not fail to acquire the love and esteem of mankind. His high reputation never inspired him with vanity, and he rather wished to conceal than to propagate what was written in his praise. It gave general joy to his monastic brethren to celebrate the anniversary of the fiftieth year of his residence in it, which he did not long survive. His health was very much impaired by his intense application, and he finished his career on the 27th of August 1791, in the 71st year of his age.","sp":284,"ep":285},{"h":"FLAG","t":"in the marine, a certain banner or standard, by which an admiral is distinguished at sea from the inferior ships of his squadron; also the colours by which one nation is distinguished from another.

When a flag is displayed from the flag-staff on the main-mast, the officer distinguished thereby is known to be an admiral; when from the fore-mast, a vice-admiral; and when from the mizen-mast a rear-admiral.\n\nThe first flag in Great Britain is the royal standard, which is only to be hoisted when the king or queen are on board the vessel; the second is that of the anchor of hope, which characterizes the lord high admiral, or lords commissioners of the admiralty; and the third is the union flag, in which the crosses of St George and St Andrew are blended. This last is appropriated to the admiral of the fleet, who is the first military officer under the lord high admiral.\n\nThe next flag after the union is that of the white squadron at the main-mast head; and the last, which characterizes an admiral, is the blue, at the same mast head.\n\nFor a vice-admiral, the first flag is the red, the second the white, the third the blue, at the flag staff on the fore-mast.\n\nThe same order proceeds with regard to the rear admirals, whose flags are hoisted on the top of the mizen-mast: the lowest flag in our navy is accordingly the blue on the mizen mast.\n\nTo Lower or Strike the Flag, in the marine, is to pull it down upon the cap, or to take it in, out of the respect, or submission, due from all ships or fleets inferior to those any way justly their superiors. To lower or strike the flag in an engagement is a sign of yielding.\n\nThe way of leading a ship in triumph is to tie the flags to the shrouds, or the gallery, in the hind part of the ship and let them hang down towards the water, and to tow the vessels by the stern.

It was in all probability no more than the effect of an indiscreet zeal. A great number of persons of all ages and sexes made processions, walking two by two with their shoulders bare, which they whipped till the blood ran down, in order to obtain mercy from God, and appease his indignation against the wickedness of the age. They were then called the devout; and having established a superior, he was called the general of the devotion. Though the primitive Flagellantes were exemplary in point of morals.\nFlagolet morals, yet they were joined by a turbulent rabble, who were infected with the most ridiculous and impious opinions; so that the emperors and pontiffs thought proper to put an end to this religious frenzy, by declaring all devout whipping contrary to the divine law, and prejudicial to the soul's eternal interest.\n\nThis sect revived in Germany towards the middle of the next century, and rambling through many provinces, occasioned great disturbances. They held, among other things, that flagellation was of equal virtue with baptism and the other sacraments; that the forgiveness of all sins was to be obtained by it from God without the merits of Jesus Christ; that the old law of Christ was soon to be abolished, and that a new law enjoining the baptism of blood to be administered by whipping was to be substituted in its place: upon which Clement VII., by an injudicious as well as unrighteous policy, thundered out anathemas against the Flagellantes, who were burnt by the inquisitors in several places; but they were not easily extirpated. They appeared again in Thuringia and Lower Saxony in the 15th century; and rejected not only the sacraments, but every branch of external worship; and placed their only hopes of salvation in faith and flagellation, to which they added other strange doctrines concerning evil spirits. Their leader Conrad Schmidt and many others were committed to the flames by German inquisitors in and after the year 1414.","sp":285,"ep":286},{"h":"FLAGOLET","t":"or Flajeulet, a little flute, used chiefly by shepherds and country people.

The name flame, how-\never, is most generally applied to such as are of a conical figure, like those arising from our common fires; without this, they are commonly called luminous vapours, or simply lights.\n\nAccording to Sir Isaac Newton, flame is only red-hot smoke, or the vapour of any substance raised from it by fire, and heated to such a degree as to emit light copiously. This definition seems to be the most accurate and expressive of any. It is certain, that bodies are capable of emitting flame only in proportion to the quantity of vapour that rises from them. Thus wood, coals, &c., which emit a great quantity of vapour, flame violently; while lead, tin, &c., which emit but a small fume, can scarce be perceived to flame at all.\n\nThis rule, however, is by no means to be depended upon in all cases. Some vapours seem to be in their own nature inflammable, and capable of extinguishing flame; as those of water, the mineral acids, sal-ammoniac, arsenic, &c.; while others take fire on the slightest approach of a flaming substance; such as ether, spirit of wine, &c. These last mentioned substances also exhibit a remarkable phenomenon; namely, that they cannot be made to flame without the approach of some substance actually in flames beforehand. Thus, spirit of wine poured on a red-hot iron, though instantly dissipated in vapour, will not flame; but if a burning candle touches its surface, the whole is set in flame at once. The case is otherwise with oils, especially those of the grocer's kind; for the vapours will readily be changed into flame by the mere increase of heat, without the approach of any flaming substance.\n\nThere is, however, no kind of vapour, perhaps, that is incapable of being converted into flame, provided it is exposed to a sufficient degree of heat. Thus the vapour of water made to pass through burning coals produces an exceedingly strong and bright flame.\u2014It is remarkable, that this kind of vapour seems to be more powerful than almost any other in absorbing heat, and retaining it in a latent state. When any quantity of aqueous vapour is condensed, more heat will be separated from it than would have been sufficient to heat an equal bulk of iron red-hot.\u2014It is most probably to this property which all vapours have of absorbing heat, and detaining it in a latent state, that we are to attribute the phenomena of flame, and also the exceeding great elasticity of steam. It is certain, that vapours, of water at least, have a much greater power of absorbing and retaining heat, than the water from which they are raised. In open vessels, water cannot be heated more than to 212 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer; but in Papin's digester, where the vapour is forcibly confined, it has been heated to 400 of the same degrees; and, no doubt, might have been heated a great deal more, had the vessels been strong enough to bear the expansive force of the steam. On opening the vessels, however, the excess of heat was found to have resided entirely in the vapour; for the water in the vessel very soon sunk down to 212, while the steam issued forth with great violence.\n\nFrom these experiments it appears, that the steam of water, after it has absorbed as much heat in a latent state as it can contain, continues to absorb, or detain among its particles, an unlimited quantity of sensible heat; and if the steam could be confined till this quantity became great enough to be visible by its emission of light, there cannot be the least doubt that the vapour would then be converted into flame.\n\nIn what manner the heat is detained among the particles of steam, is perhaps impossible to be explained; but to this heat we must undoubtedly ascribe the violent expansive force of steam of every kind. It seems probable, that when smoke is converted into flame, the latent heat with which the vapour had combined, or rather that which made an essential part of it, breaks forth, and adds to the quantity of sensible heat which is already present. This seems probable, from the sudden explosion with which all flames break out. If a vessel full of oil is set over the fire, a smoke or vapour begins to arise from it; which grows gradually thicker and thicker; and at last begins to thine in some places very near the surface of the oil, like an electric light, or sulphur just kindled. At this time the oil is very hot, as well as the steam which issues from it. But this last is continually giving off its sensible heat into the atmosphere; so that at the distance of an inch or two from the surface of the oil, the heat of the steam will not exceed 400 degrees of Fahrenheit, or perhaps may not be so much; but if a burning candle is held in the steam for a moment, the whole is immediately converted into flame, with something like an explosion; after which, the oil burns quietly until it is all consumed. The flame, as soon as it appears, is not only much hotter than the steam from whence it was produced, but even than the oil which lies below it. Whence, then, has this sudden and great increase of heat arisen? It could not be the sensible heat of the vapour, for that was greatly inferior; nor could it be communicated from the oil, for that could communicate no more than it had to itself. The candle, indeed, would communicate a quantity of heat to the vapour which touched its flame; but it is impossible that this quantity should extend permanently over a surface perhaps 100 times larger than the flame of the candle, in such a manner as to make every part of that surface equally hot with the flame of the candle itself; for this would be to suppose it to communicate 100 times more heat than really was in it. The heat therefore must have originally resided in the vapour itself; and as, in the freezing of water, its latent heat is extricated and becomes sensible, and the water thereupon loses its fluidity; so, in the ascension of vapour, the latent heat breaks forth with a bright flash, and the vapour is then totally decomposed, and converted into foot, ashes, or water, according to the different nature of the substances which produce it, or according to the intensity of the heat.\u2014Several other hypotheses have been invented to solve the phenomena of burning and flaming bodies; for an account of which, see Ignition and Heat, Chemistry Index.\n\nFlames are of different colours, according to the substances from which they are produced. Thus, the flame of sulphur and spirit of wine is blue; the flame of nitre and zinc, of a bright white; that of copper, of a greenish blue, &c.\u2014These varieties afford an opportunity of making a number of agreeable representations in fireworks, which could not be done if the flame produced from every different substance was of the same colour.

Mr Hatton, a mathematician, sent him Kepler's Tabula Rudolphinae, and Riccioli's Almagestum Novum, together with some other astronomical works to which he was as yet a stranger.

From the experiments of Count Rumford, it appears, that there is a relation betwixt the power which the substances usually worn as clothing have of absorbing moisture, and that of keeping the body warm. Having provided a quantity of each of these substances mentioned below, he exposed them, spread out upon clean China plates, for the space of 24 hours to the warm and dry air of a room which had been heated by a German stove for several months, and during the last six hours had raised the thermometer to 85\u00b0 of Fahrenheit; after which he weighed equal quantities of the different substances with a very accurate balance. They were then spread out upon a China plate, and removed into a very large uninhabited room upon the second floor, where they were exposed 48 hours upon a table placed in the middle of the room, the air of which was at 45\u00b0 of Fahrenheit. At the end of this space they were weighed, and then removed into a damp cellar, and placed on a table in the middle of the vault, where the air was at the temperature of 45\u00b0, and which by the hygrometer seemed to be fully saturated with moisture. In this situation they were suffered to remain three days and three nights; the vault being all the time hung round with wet linen cloths, to render the air as completely damp as possible.

May not this arise principally from the strong attraction which subsists between wool and the watery vapour which is continually issuing from the human body? That it does not depend entirely on the warmth of that covering, is clear; for the same degree of warmth produced by wearing more clothing of a different kind, does not produce the same effect. The perspiration of the human body being absorbed by a covering of flannel, it is immediately distributed through the whole thickness of that substance, and by that means exposed, by a very large surface, to be carried off by the atmosphere; and the loss of this watery vapour which the flannel sustains on the one side by evaporation, being immediately restored from the other, in consequence of the strong attraction between the flannel and this vapour, the pores of the skin are disencumbered, and they are continually surrounded by a dry and salubrious atmosphere.\"","sp":289,"ep":290},{"h":"FLANK","t":"or FLANGE, in the manege, is applied to the sides of a horse's buttocks, &c.

See LINUM, BOTANY Index.\n\nThe following particulars with regard to the manner of raising flax, have been some years past warmly recommended by the trustees for fisheries, manufactures, and improvements in Scotland.\n\nOf the choice of the Soil, and preparing the Ground for Flax. A skilful flax-raiser always prefers a free open deep loam; and all grounds that produced the preceding year a good crop of turnip, cabbage, potatoes, barley, or broad clover, or have been formerly laid down rich, and kept for some years in pasture.\n\nA clay soil, the second or third crop after being limed, will answer well for flax; provided, if the ground be still stiff, that it be brought to a proper mould, by tilling after harvest to expose it to the winter frosts.\n\nAll new grounds produce a strong crop of flax, and pretty free of weeds. When a great many mole heaps appear upon new ground, it answers the better for flax, after one tilling.\n\nFlax seed ought never to be sown on grounds that are either too wet or dry; but on such as retain a natural moisture: and such grounds as are inclined to weeds ought to be avoided, unless prepared by a careful summer fallow.\n\nIf the linseed be sown early, and the flax not allowed to stand for seed, a crop of turnip may be got after the flax that very year; the second year a crop of bear or barley may be taken; and the third year, grass seeds are sometimes sown along with the linseed. This is the method mostly practised in and about the counties of Lincoln and Somerset, where great quantities of flax and hemp are every year raised, and where these crops have long been capital articles. There, old ploughed grounds are never sown with linseed, unless the soil be very rich and clean. A certain worm, called in Scotland the coup worm, abounds in grounds newly broken up, and greatly hurts every crop but flax. In small enclosures surrounded with trees or high hedges, the flax, for want of free air, is subject to fall before it be ripe; and the droppings of rain and dew from the trees prevent the flax, within the reach of the trees, from growing to any perfection.\n\nOf preceding crops, potatoes and hemp are the best preparation for flax. In the fens of Lincoln, upon proper ground of old tillage, they sow hemp, dunging well the first year; the second year, hemp without dung; the third year, flax without dung; and that same year, a crop of turnip eaten on the ground by sheep; the fourth year, hemp with a large coat of dung; and so on for ever.\n\nIf the ground be free and open, it should be but once ploughed; and that as shallow as possible, not deeper than 2\u00bd inches. It should be laid flat, reduced to a fine garden mould by much harrowing, and all stones and lods should be carried off.\n\nExcept a little pigeons dung for cold or four ground, no other dung should be used preparatory for flax; because it produces too many weeds, and throws up the flax thin and poor upon the stalk.\n\nBefore sowing, the bulky clods should be broken, or carried off the ground; and stones, quickenings, and every other thing that may hinder the growth of the flax should be removed.\n\nOf the choice of Linseed. The brighter in colour, and heavier the seed is, so much the better; that which when bruised appears of a light or yellowish green, and fresh in the heart, oily and not dry, and smells and tastes sweet, and not fusty, may be depended upon.\n\nDutch seed of the preceding year's growth, for the most part, answers best; but it seldom succeeds if kept another year. It ripens sooner than any other foreign seed. Philadelphia seed produces fine lint and few bolls, because sown thick, and answers best in wet cold soils. Riga seed produces coarser lint, and the greatest quantity of seed. Scots seed, when well winned and kept, and changed from one kind of soil to another, sometimes answers pretty well; but should be sown thick, as many of its grains are bad, and fail. It springs well, and its flax is sooner ripe than any other; but its produce afterwards is generally inferior to that from foreign seed.\n\nA kind has been lately imported called Memmel seed; which looks well, is short and plump, but seldom grows above eight inches, and on that account ought not to be sown.\n\nOf Sowing Linseed. The quantity of linseed sown should be proportioned to the condition of the soil; for if the ground be in good heart, and the seed sown thick, the crop will be in danger of falling before it is ready for pulling. From 11 to 12 pecks Linlithgow measure of Dutch or Riga seed, is generally sufficient for one Scots acre; and about 10 pecks of Philadelphia seed, which, being the smallest grained, goes farthest. Riga linseed, and the next year's produce of it, is preferred in Lincolnshire.\n\nThe time for sowing linseed is from the middle of March to the end of April, as the ground and season answers.\nanswers; but the earlier the seed is sown, the less the crop interferes with the corn harvest.\n\nLate sown linseed may grow long, but the flax upon the stalk will be thin and poor.\n\nAfter sowing, the ground ought to be harrowed till the seed is well covered, and then (supposing the soil, as before mentioned, to be free and reduced to a fine mould) it ought to be rolled.\n\nWhen a farmer sows a large quantity of linseed, he may find it proper to sow a part earlier and part later, that in the future operations of weeding, pulling, watering, and grafting, the work may be the easier and more conveniently gone about.\n\nIt ought always to be sown on a dry bed.\n\nOf Weeding Flax. It ought to be weeded when the crop is about four inches long. If longer deferred, the weeder will too much break and crook the stalks, that they will never perhaps recover their straightness again; and when the flax grows crooked, it is more liable to be hurt in the rippling and swinging.\n\nQuicken grass should not be taken up; for, being strongly rooted, the pulling of it always loosens a deal of the lint.\n\nIf there is an appearance of a settled drought, it is better to defer the weeding, than by that operation to expose the tender roots of the flax to the drought.\n\nHow soon the weeds are got out, they ought to be carried off the field, instead of being laid in the furrows, where they often take root again, and at any rate obstruct the growth of the flax in the furrows.\n\nOf Pulling Flax. When the crop grows so short and branchy, as to appear more valuable for seed than flax, it ought not to be pulled before it be thoroughly ripe; but if it grows long and not branchy, the seed should be disregarded, and all the attention given to the flax. In the last case it ought to be pulled after the bloom has fallen, when the stalk begins to turn yellow, and before the leaves fall, and the bolls turn hard and sharp pointed.\n\nWhen the stalk is small, and carries few bolls, the flax is fine; but the stalk of coarse flax is grofs, rank, branchy, and carries many bolls.\n\nWhen the flax has fallen, and lies, such as lies ought to be immediately pulled, whether it has grown enough or not, as otherwise it will rot altogether.\n\nWhen parts of the same field grow unequally, so that some parts are ready for pulling before other parts; only what is ready should be pulled, and the rest should be suffered to stand till ready.\n\nThe flax-raiser ought to be at pains to pull and keep by itself, each different kind of lint which he finds in his field; what is both long and fine, by itself; what is both long and coarse, by itself; what is both short and fine, by itself; what is both short and coarse, by itself; and in like manner every other kind by itself that is of the same size and quality. If the different kinds be not thus kept separate, the flax must be much damaged in the watering and the other succeeding operations.\n\nWhat is commonly called under-growth may be neglected as useless.\n\nFew persons that have seen pulled flax, are ignorant of the method of laying it in handfuls across each other; which gives the flax sufficient air, and keeps the handfuls separate and ready for the rippler.\n\nOf Stacking up Flax during the Winter, and Winning the Seed. If the flax be more valuable than the seed, it ought by no means to be stacked up; for its own natural juice affords it greatly in the watering; whereas, if kept long unwatered, it looses that juice, and the harle adheres so much to the boon, that it requires longer time to water, and even the quality of the flax becomes thereby harsher and coarser. Besides, the flax attacked over year, is in great danger from vermine and other accidents; the water in spring is not so soft and warm as in harvest; and near a year is thereby lost of the use of the lint: but if the flax be so short and branchy as to appear most valuable for seed, it ought, after pulling, to be stooked and dried upon the field, as is done with corn; then stacked up for winter, rippled in spring; and after wheeling, the seed should be well cleaned from bad seeds, &c.\n\nOf Rippling Flax. After pulling, if the flax is to be regarded more than the seed, it should be allowed to lie some hours upon the ground to dry a little, and to gain some firmness, to prevent the skin or harle, which is the flax, from rubbing off in the rippling; an operation which ought by no means to be neglected, as the bolls, if put into the water along with the flax, breed vermine there, and otherwise spoil the water. The bolls also prove very inconvenient in the dressing and breaking.\n\nIn Lincolnshire and Ireland, they think that rippling hurts the flax; and therefore, in place of rippling, they strike the bolls against a stone.\n\nThe handfuls for rippling should not be great, as that endangers the lint in the rippling comb.\n\nAfter rippling, the flax-raiser will perceive, that he is able to afford each size and quality of the flax by itself more exactly than he could before.\n\nOf Watering Flax. A running stream wastes the lint, makes it white, and frequently carries it away. Lochs, by the great quantity and motion of the water, also whiten and whiten the flax, though not so much as running streams. Both rivers and lochs water the flax quicker than canals.\n\nBut all flax ought to be watered in canals, which should be dugged in clay ground if possible, as that soil retains the water best: but if a firm retentive soil cannot be got, the bottom or sides of the canal, or both the bottom and sides, may be lined with clay; or instead of lining the sides with clay, which might fall down, a ditch may be dug without the canal, and filled with clay, which will prevent both extraneous water from entering, and the water within from running off.\n\nA canal of 40 feet long, six broad, and four deep, will generally water the growth of an acre of flax.\n\nIt ought to be filled with fresh soft water from a river or brook, if possible, two or three weeks before the flax is put in, and exposed all that time to the heat of the sun. The greater way the river or brook has run, the softer, and therefore the better, will the water be. Springs, or short runs from hills, are too cold, unless the water is allowed to stand long in the canal. Water from coal or iron is very bad for flax. A little of the powder of galls thrown into a glass of water, will\nwill immediately discover if it comes from minerals of that kind, by turning it into a dark colour, more or less tinged in proportion to the quantity of vitriol it contains.\n\nThe canal ought not to be under shade; which, besides keeping the sun from softening the water, might make part of the canal cooler than other parts, and so water the flax unequally.\n\nThe flax-raiser will observe, when the water is brought to a proper heat, that small plants will be rising quickly in it, numbers of small insects and reptiles will be generating there, and bubbles of air rising on the surface. If no such signs appear, the water must not be warm enough, or is otherwise unfit for flax.\n\nMold holes, when neither too deep nor too shallow, frequently answer well for watering flax, when the water is proper, as before described.\n\nThe proper season for watering flax is from the end of July to the end of August.\n\nThe advantage of watering flax as soon as possible after pulling, has been already mentioned.\n\nThe flax being forced after rippling, as before mentioned, should next be put in beets, never larger than a man can grasp with both his hands, and tied very slack with a band of a few stalks. Dried rushes answer exceedingly well for binding flax, as they do not rot in the water, and may be dried and kept for use again.\n\nThe beets should be put into the canals slopewise, or half standing upon end, the root end uppermost. Upon the crop ends, when uppermost, there frequently breeds a deal of vermine, destructive of the flax, which is effectually prevented by putting the crop end downmost.\n\nThe whole flax in the canal ought to be carefully covered from the sun with divots; the grassy side of which should be next the flax, to keep it clean. If it is not thus covered, the sun will discolour the flax, though quite covered with water. If the divots are not weighty enough to keep the flax entirely under water, a few stones may be laid above them. But the flax should not be pressed to the bottom.\n\nWhen the flax is sufficiently watered, it feels soft to the gripe, and the harle parts easily with the boon or bow, which last is then become brittle, and looks whitish. When these signs are found, the flax should be taken out of the water, beat after beat; each gently rinsed in the water, to cleanse it of the nastiness which has gathered about it in the canal; and as the lint is then very tender, and the beat slackly tied, it must be carefully and gently handled.\n\nGreat care ought to be taken that no part be overdone; and as the coarsest waters soonest, if different kinds be mixed together, a part will be rotted, when the rest is not sufficiently watered.\n\nWhen lint taken out of the canal is not found sufficiently watered, it may be laid in a heap for 12, 18, or 24 hours, which will have an effect like more watering; but this operation is nice, and may prove dangerous in unskilful hands.\n\nAfter the flax is taken out of the canal, fresh lint, should not be put a second time into it, until the former water be run off, and the canal cleaned, and supplied with fresh water.\n\nOf Grafting Flax. Short heath is the best field for grafting flax; as, when wet, it fattens to the heath, and is thereby prevented from being blown away by the wind. The heath also keeps it a little above the earth, and so exposes it the more equally to the weather. When such heath is not to be got, links or clean old tea ground is the next best. Long grass grounds should be avoided, as the grafts growing through the lint frequently spots, tenders, or rots it; and grounds exposed to violent winds should also be avoided.\n\nThe flax, when taken out of the water, must be spread very thin upon the ground; and being then very tender, it must be gently handled. The thinner it is spread the better, as it is then the more equally exposed to the weather. But it ought never to be spread during a heavy shower, as that would wash and waste the harle too much, which is then excessively tender, but soon after becomes firm enough to bear the rains, which, with the open air and sunshine, cleans, softens, and purifies the harle to the degree wanted, and makes it bliter from the boom. In short, after the flax has got a little firmness by being a few hours spread in dry weather, the more rain and sunshine it gets the better.\n\nIf there be little danger of high winds carrying off the flax, it will be much the better of being turned about once a week. If it is not to be turned, it ought to be very thin spread. The spreading of flax and hemp requires a deal of ground, and enriches it greatly.\n\nThe skilful flax-raiser spreads his first row of flax at the end of the field opposite to the point from whence the most violent wind commonly comes, placing the root-ends foremost; he makes the root-ends of every other row overlap the crop ends of the former row three or four inches, and binds down the last row with a rope; by which means the wind does not easily get below the lint to blow it away; and as the crop ends are seldom so fully watered as the root ends, the aforesaid overlapping has an effect like giving the crop ends more watering. Experience only can fully teach a person the signs of flax being sufficiently grafted: then it is of a clearer colour than formerly; the harle is blittered up, and easily parts with the boon, which is then become very brittle. The whole should be sufficiently grafted before any of it is lifted; for if a part be lifted sooner than the rest, that which remains is in great danger from the winds.\n\nA dry day ought to be chosen for taking up the flax; and if there is no appearance of high wind, it should be loosed from the heath or grafts, and left loose for some hours, to make it thoroughly dry.\n\nAs a great quantity of flax can scarcely be all equally watered and grafted, and as the different qualities will best appear at lifting the flax off the grafts; therefore at that time each different kind should be gathered together, and kept by itself; that is, all of the same colour, length, and quality.\n\nThe smaller the beets lint is made up in, the better for drying, and the more convenient for stacking, housing, &c. and in making up these beets, as in every other operation upon flax, it is of great consequence that the lint be laid together as it grew; the root ends together, and the crop ends together.\nFollows an estimate of the Expence, Produce, and Profit of a Scots Acre of Flax\u2014supposing the season favourable, that no accidental losses happen, and that the farmer is neither unskillful nor negligent.\n\n| Ground rent, labouring the ground, and leading the flax Linseed from 2l. to 4l. per hoghead, the medium 3s. 4d. per peck | A medium crop. | A great crop. | An extra crop. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Clodding and sowing | L. 2 10 | L. 3 10 | L. 5 0 |\n| Weeding | 1 16 8 | 1 10 0 | 1 6 8 |\n| Pulling, rippling, putting in, and covering in the water | 0 2 0 | 0 2 0 | nothing. |\n| Taking out of the water, grassing, and stacking | 0 14 0 | 0 15 0 | 1 0 0 |\n| Breaking and fetching, at 2s. per stone | 0 8 0 | 0 12 0 | 0 18 0 |\n| Total expense | L. 9 2 8 | L. 10 17 | L. 14 6 8 |\n\n| Produce at 10s. per stone. | L. 15 0 | L. 20 0 | L. 30 0 |\n| Linseed sold for oil at 1s. per peck | for 30 stones. | for 40 stones. | for 60 stones. |\n| The chaff of the bolls is well worth the expence of drying the seed; as it is good food, when boiled and mixed with bear, for horses. | 0 16 0 | 0 18 0 | 1 0 0 |\n| Total produce | L. 15 10 | L. 20 18 | L. 31 0 |\n| Balance for profit | L. 6 14 4 | L. 10 1 | L. 16 13 4 |\n\nThe above estimate being made several years ago, the expence and profit are now different; but the proportions of each are probably the same. There is nothing stated here as expence of the canal in which the flax is watered; because that varies much according to circumstances.\n\nIt is a certain fact, that the greater the crop is, the better is the quality of the same kind of flax.\n\nThe advantage of having both a crop of flax and a crop of turnip the same year\u2014or of sowing grass seeds along with the linseed\u2014and of reducing the ground to a fine garden mould, free of weeds, ought to be attended to.\n\nFor Cambrie and fine Lawn. The ground must be a rich light soil, rather sandy, but cannot be too rich.\n\nIt ought to be ploughed in September, or the beginning of October, first putting a little hot rotten dung upon it. In January it ought to have a second ploughing, after a hard frost; and when you intend to sow it, plough it a third time, or rather hoe it, reducing the clods very fine; but make no furrows: the land must be made level like a garden; but never work the land when wet.\n\nThe seed should be sown the beginning of April, and about double the quantity that is generally sown by our farmers; if the land be very rich, it will require rather more than double.\n\nAs soon as sown (if the weather be dry) it will be necessary to roll the ground.\n\nThe lint must be weeded very clean when about three inches high; directly after which you must set forked sticks, of about one and a half inch thick (which ought to be prepared before), every four or five feet, according to the length of the poles you are to lay upon them; they should be well fixed in the ground, the forked part to receive the poles about six or seven inches above the lint; each row of poles should be two, three, or four feet slumber, according to the length of the brushwood you are to lay upon them.\n\nThe poles ought to be from 10 to 15 feet long, and strong enough to support the brush across the poles; take the longest brushwood you can get, the more branchy the better, very thick, filling up the vacancies with smaller brush, and any of the branches that rise higher than 18 or 20 inches ought to be lopped off to make the brush lie as level as possible: any sort of brush will do except oak, as that tinges the lint.\n\nYour lint must be pulled as soon as the seed is fully formed, which is a few days after it is out of the bloom, before the lint turn yellow.\n\nIt must be pulled above the brushwood, and every handful laid upon it as soon as possible: if it is fine weather, leave it four or five hours in that manner: then carry it to a screen near a barn, to put it under cover in case of rain; there it must be spread four or five days, and always put in the barn at night, or when it appears to rain: the bundles must be opened in the barn, or made hollow, to prevent it from heating.\n\nThese operations must be performed until the lint is perfectly dry, and out of danger of heating; taking care all the time to keep the roots as even as possible, and if possible keep it from rain or wet: if you cannot prevent it from being wet, it will be better to leave it on the grass till dry; because when once wet, the putting it under cover before dry will make it turn black; a thing which must be prevented at all events.\n\nIf any of the lint upon the border, or through the piece of ground, be coarser than another, it must be separated from the rest.\nThe utmost care must be taken to preserve the flax entire or unbroken; for this reason they beat off the feed with a round mallet or bittle.\n\nThe most proper ground is summer fallow, or after potatoes or lea; if possible near a wood, to prevent the expense of carrying brush.\n\nAs soon as the feed is off, if you intend to water it that season, it must be tied in bundles about as large as you can grasp with your two hands.\n\nThe water proper for it, is a very small rivulet or soft spring free of any metallic ore; taking care that no flood or foul water enters your pit; which must be at least five feet deep, about nine or ten broad at the top, and seven or eight at the bottom; the length will depend on the quantity of flax you have to water. A very small stripe of water, when clear, should always be running in and off from your pit when the lint is in it.\n\nThe pit ought to be made three or four months before it is used.\n\nYou must drive poles about four inches thick, with a hook inclining downwards, in this form 7, all along the sides of the pit, above five feet asunder. The hooks must be level with, or rather under, the surface of the water. A long pole, the whole length of the pit, must be fixed into these hooks on each side; and crofs poles put under that, to keep the lint under water; but the crofs poles are not used till the lint is put in. You must order it so, that all the lint should be three or four inches under water. You next bring your lint to the sides of the pit; then put your fleaves head to head, causing each to overlap the other about one-third, and take as many of these as make a bundle of two or two and a half feet broad, laying the one above the other till it is about four or four and a half feet high; then you tie them together in the middle, and at each root end: after this you wrap your bundle in straw, and lay it in the water, putting the thin or broad side undermost, taking care that none of your lint touch the earth; after it is fully preffed under water, put in your crofs poles to keep it under. The bundles ought to lie in the pit a foot separate from each other. This renders it easy to take out; for, if the bundles entangle, they will be too heavy to raise.\n\nThe time of watering depends so much upon the weather, and softness or hardness of the water, that it is impossible to fix any certain time. This must be left to the skill of the farmer. If the flax is intended for spinning yarn soft and fit for cambric, it ought to be spread upon short grass for four or five days before you put it into the water; but if for lawns, lace, or thread, it is best to dry it outright. In either case, avoid as much as possible to let it get rain; as much rain blanches and wastes out the oil, which is necessary to preserve the strength.\n\nThe great property of this flax is to be fine and long. Thick sowing raises all plants fine and slender; and when the ground is very rich, it forces them to a great length. Pulling green prevents that coarse hardness which flax has when let stand till it be full ripe, and gives it the fine silky property. The brushwood, when the flax springs up catches it by the middle, and prevents it from lying down and rotting; infallible consequences of sowing thick upon rich ground. It likewise keeps it straight, moist, and soft at the roots; and by keeping it warm, and shaded from the sun, greatly promotes its length. The keeping it from rain, heating, taking proper care of your water, preserves the colour, and prevents those bars in cloth so much complained of by bleachers.\n\n**Flax-Dressing.** For many ages it was the practice to separate the boon or core from the flax, which is the bark of the plant, by the following simple hand methods. First, for breaking the boon, the stalks in small parcels were beat with a mallet; or, more dexterously, the break (Plate CCXVIII. fig. 1. and 2.) was used thus: The flax being held in the left hand across the three under teeth or swords of the break (A, fig. 1. and a fig. 2.), the upper teeth (B, fig. 1. and b, fig. 2.) were with the right hand quickly and often forced down upon the flax, which was artfully shifted and turned with the left hand. Next, for clearing the flax of the broken boon: the workman with his left hand held the flax over the flock (fig. 3. and 4.), while with his right hand he struck or thrashed the flax with the scutchers (fig. 5.)\n\nThese methods of breaking and scutching the flax being slow and very laborious, a water-mill was invented in Scotland about the year 1750; which, with some improvements, makes great despatch, and in skilful and careful hands gives satisfaction. It has been generally constructed to break the boon by three dentled rollers, placed one above the other. The middle one of which, being forced quickly round, takes the other two along with it, and one end of the handfuls of the flax being by the workmen directed in between the upper and middle rollers, the flax is immediately drawn in by the rollers; a curved board or plate of tin behind the rollers directs the flax to return again between the middle and undermost rollers;\u2014and thus the operation is repeated until the boon be sufficiently broke. Great weights of timber or stone at the ends of levers, press the upper and under rollers towards the middle one.\n\nThe scutching is next carried on by the mill in the following manner: Four arms, something like the hand-scutchers before described, project from a perpendicular axle; a box around the axle encloses these projecting scutchers; and this box is divided among the workmen, each having sufficient room to stand and handle his flax, which, through slits in the upper part and sides of the box, they hold in to the stroke of the scutchers; which, moving sound horizontally, strike the flax across at right angles, and so thrash out or clear it of the boon.\n\nThe breaking of the flax by rollers is scarcely subject to any objection, but that it is dangerous to workmen not sufficiently on their guard, who sometimes allow the rollers to take hold of their fingers, and thereby their whole arm is instantly drawn in: thus many have lost their arms. To avoid this danger, a break, upon the general principles of the hand-break before described, has been lately adapted to water-machinery, and used in place of rollers. The horizontal stroke of the scutchers was long thought too severe, and wasteful of the flax; but very careful experiments have discovered that the waste complained of must be charged to the unskillfulness or negligence of the workmen, as in good hands the mill carries away nothing but what, if not so scutched off, must\nFlax be taken off in the heckling, with more loss both of time and flax. But to obviate this objection of the violence of the horizontal scutchers, an imitation of hand-scutching has lately been applied to water. The scutchers then project from a horizontal axle, and move like the arms of a check reel, striking the flax neither across nor perpendicularly down, but sloping in upon the parcel exactly as the flax is struck by the hand-scutter. This sloping stroke is got by raising the scutching stock some inches higher than the centre of the axle; and by raising or lowering the stock over which the flax is held, or screwing it nearer to or farther from the scutchers, the workman can temper or humour the stroke almost as he pleases.\n\nA lint mill, with horizontal scutchers upon a perpendicular axle, requires a house of two stories, the rollers or break being placed in the ground story, and the scutchers in the loft above; but a mill with vertical scutchers on a horizontal axle, requires but one ground story for all the machinery.\n\nAnother method of breaking and scutching flax, more expeditious than the old hand methods, and more gentle than water mills, has also been invented in Scotland. It is much like the break and scutter, giving the slopping stroke last described, moved by the foot. The treddle is remarkably long, and the scutchers are fixed upon the rim of a fly wheel. The foot-break is also assisted in its motion by a fly. These foot machines are very useful where there are no water mills, but they are far inferior to the mills in point of expedition.\n\nThe next operation that flax undergoes after scutching is heckling. The heckle (fig. 6.) is firmly fixed to a bench before the workman, who strikes the flax upon the teeth of the heckle, and draws it through the teeth. To persons unacquainted with that kind of work this may seem a very simple operation; but, in fact, it requires as much practice to acquire the flight of heckling well, and without wasting the flax, as any other operation in the whole manufacture of linen. They use coarser and wider teathed heckles, or finer, according to the quality of the flax; generally putting the flax through two heckles, a coarser one first, and next a fine one.\n\nFlax for Cambric and fine Lawn, Thread, and Lace, is dressed in a manner somewhat different. It is not scutched so thoroughly as common flax; which from the scutch proceeds to the heckle, and from that to the spinner; whereas, this fine flax, after a rough scutching, is scraped and cleaned with a blunt knife upon the workman's knee covered with his leather apron; from the knife it proceeds to the spinner, who, with a brush made for the purpose, straightens and dresses each parcel just before she begins to spin it.\n\nThe following observations on this subject, first published in the Gentleman's Magazine for June 1787, seem worthy of particular attention.\n\nOf the watering of Flax by a new method, so as to shorten labour, to add probably to the strength of the flax, and to give it a much finer colour, which would render the operation of bleaching safer and less tedious.\n\n\"Though the following reflections have for their object an improvement in the very essential article of watering of flax, yet I must advertise the reader, that they are only theory, and must depend entirely for their truth and justification upon future experiments, skilfully and judiciously made. Should repeated trials prove the advantage of the new method proposed, we may venture to affirm, that it would be an improvement that would increase the national income in the agricultural branch many thousand pounds annually, would add greatly to the perfection of the linen manufacture, and over and above would suppress a very disagreeable nuisance, which the present method of watering flax occasions during some part of the summer in every flax-growing country.\n\n\"The intention of watering flax is, in my opinion, to make the boon more brittle or friable, and, by soaking, to dissolve that gluey kind of sap that makes the bark of plants and trees adhere in a small degree to the woody part. The bark of flax is called the harle; and when separated from the useless woody part, the boon, this harle itself is called flax. To effect this separation easily, the practice has long prevailed, of soaking the flax in water to a certain degree of fermentation, and afterwards drying it. For this soaking some prefer rivulets that have a small current, and others stagnant water in ponds and lakes. In both methods the water acts as in all other cases of infusion and maceration; after two or three weeks it extracts a great many juices of a very strong quality, which in ponds give the water an inky tinge and offensive smell; and in rivulets mix in the stream and kill the fish. Nay, if this maceration be too long continued, the extracted and fermented sap will completely kill the flax itself. For if, instead of two or three weeks, the new flax were to lie soaking in the water four or five months, I presume it would be good for nothing but to be thrown upon the dunghill; both harle and boon would in time be completely rotted; yet the harle or flax, when entirely freed from this sap, and manufactured into linen, or into ropes, might lie many months under water without being much damaged; as linen, it may be washed and steeped in scalding water twenty times without losing much of its strength; and as paper, it acquires a kind of incorruptibility.\n\n\"It appears then essential to the right management of new flax, to get rid of this pernicious vegetative sap, and to macerate the boon; but from the complaints made against both the methods of watering now in use, there is reason to think that there is still great room for improvement in that article. In rivulets, the vegetative sap, as it is dissolved, is carried off by the current, to the destruction of the fish. This prevents the flax from being stained; but the operation is tedious, and not complete, from the uncertainty of knowing when it is just enough, and not too much, or perhaps from neglect. In ponds, the inky tinge of the water often serves as a kind of dye to the flax, which imbibes it so strongly, that double the labour in bleaching will hardly bring the linen made of such flax to an equality in whiteness with linen made of flax untinged. This seems to be equally untrue as though we were to die cotton black first, in order to whiten it afterwards. These ponds, besides, become a great nuisance to the neighbourhood; the impregnated water is often of such a pernicious quality, that cattle,\ncattle, however thirsty, will not drink of it; and the effluvia of it may perhaps be nearly as infectious as it is offensive. If this effluvia is really attended with any contagious effects in our cold climate, a thing worth the inquiring into, how much more pernicious must its effects have been in the hot climate of Egypt, a country early noted for its great cultivation of flax?\n\n\"I have often thought that the process of watering might be greatly improved and shortened by plunging the new flax, after it is rippled, into scalding water; which, in regard to extracting the vegetative sap, would do in five minutes more than cold water would do in a fortnight, or perhaps more than cold water could do at all, in respect to the clearing the plant of sap. Rough almonds, when thrown into scalding water, are blanched in an instant; but perhaps a fortnight's macerating those almonds in cold water would not make them part so easily with their skins, which are the same to them as the harle is to the flax. Were tea leaves to be infused in cold water a fortnight, perhaps the tea produced by that infusion would not be so good to the taste, or so strongly tinged to the eye, as what is effected by scalding water in five minutes. By the same analogy, I think, flax or any final twig would be made to part with its bark much easier and quicker by being dipped in boiling water than by being steeped in cold water.\n\n\"This reflection opens a door for a great variety of new experiments in regard to flax. I would therefore recommend to gentlemen cultivators and farmers, to make repeated trials upon this new system, which would soon ascertain whether it ought to be adopted in practice or rejected. One thing, I think, we may be certain of, that if the Egyptians watered their flax in our common manner, they undoubtedly watered it in very warm water, from the great heat of their climate, which would probably make them neglect to think of water heated by any other means than that of the sun. A good general practice can only be established upon repeated trials. Though one experiment may fail, another with a little variation may succeed; and the importance of the object desired to be obtained will justify a good degree of perseverance in the prosecution of the means. In this view, as the Chinese thread is said to be very strong, it would be worth while to be acquainted with the practice of that distant nation, in regard to the rearing and manufacturing of flax, as well as with the methods used by the Flemings and the Dutch.\n\n\"Boiling water perhaps might at once clear the new flax from many impurities, which when not removed till it be spun into yarn, are then removed with difficulty, and with loss of substance to the yarn. Why should not the longitudinal fibres of the flax, before they be spun into yarn, be made not only as fine but as clean as possible? Upon the new system proposed, the act of bleaching would begin immediately after the rippling of the flax; and a little done then, might perhaps save much of what is generally done after the spinning and weaving. To spin dirty flax with a view of cleaning it afterwards, appears to be the same impropriety as though we were to reserve part of the dressing given to leather till after it is made into a glove.\n\n\"Should the plunging of the flax into the boiling water not suffice to make the boon brittle enough, as I am inclined to think it would not, then the common watering might be added; but in that case probably half the time usually given to this watering would suffice, and the flax might then be laid in clear rivulets, without any apprehension of its infecting the water and poisoning the fish, or of being discoloured itself; for the boiling water into which it had been previously put, would have extracted all the poisonous vegetative sap, which I presume is what chiefly discolours the flax or kills the fish.\n\n\"On the supposition, that the use of boiling water in the preparation of flax may be found to be advantageous and profitable, I can recollect at present but one objection against its being generally adopted. Every flax-grower, it may be said, could not be expected to have conveniences for boiling water sufficient for the purpose; the consumption of water would be great; and some additional expense would be incurred. In answer to this, I shall observe, that I presume any additional expense would be more than reimbursed by the better marketable price of the flax; for otherwise any new improvement, if it will not quit cost must be dropt, were it even the searching after gold. In a large caldron a great deal of flax might be dip in the same water, and the consumption perhaps would not be more than a quart, to each sheaf. Even a large household pot would be capable of containing one sheaf after another; and I believe the whole objection would be obviated, were the practice to prevail with us, as in Flanders and Holland, that the flax-grower and the flax-dresser should be two distinct professions.\n\n\"I shall conclude with recommending to those who are inclined to make experiments, not to be discouraged by the failure of one or two trials.\u2014Perhaps the flax, instead of being just plunged into the scalding water, ought to be kept in it five minutes, perhaps a quarter of an hour, perhaps a whole hour. Should five minutes or a quarter of an hour, or an hour, not be sufficient to make the boon and harle easily separate, it might perhaps be found expedient to boil the flax for more than an hour; and such boiling when in this state might in return save several hours boiling in the article of bleaching. It is not, I think, at all probable that the boiling of the flax with the boon in it would prejudice the harle; for in the course of its future existence, it is made to be exposed 20 or 40 times to this boiling trial; and if not detrimental in the one case, it is to be presumed it would not be detrimental in the other. Perhaps after the boiling, it would be proper to pile up the flax in one heap for a whole day, or for half a day, to occasion some fermentation; or perhaps, immediately after the boiling, it might be proper to wash it with cold water. The great object, when the flax is pulled, is to get the harle from the boon with as little loss and damage as possible; and if this is accomplished in a more complete manner than usual, considerable labour and expense will be saved in the future manufacturing of the flax. On this account I think much more would be gained than lost, were the two or three last inches of the roots of the stems to be chopped off, or clipped off previous to the flax being either watered or boiled. When the flax is watered, care should be taken not to spread it out to dry.\"\ndry, when there is a hazard of its being exposed in its wet state to frost.\"\n\nTo what we have now said we shall add the following short account of the flax husbandry of Ireland, in a letter which appeared in the Farmers Magazine, vol. vii. page 35.\n\n\"Having for several years (says the writer) been engaged in the culture of flax, I devoted a part of last summer to a tour through the manufacturing districts of Ireland. Here that branch of husbandry has long been established over a large extent of the country, and conducted with very considerable success. As some of the processes in this culture, which are followed with advantage, are either unknown to the Scots farmers, or are performed in a very awkward and inefficient manner, it might, I conceive, prove of no small benefit, were some of your intelligent correspondents induced to lay before them a plain sketch of the peculiar management observed by the Irish peasantry in this important article. I am the more desirous it should appear in your pages, because a periodical work on husbandry, conducted by a practical farmer, appears before the public with manifest advantage, and is received with that sort of deference which is due to experience and authority. The difficulties of actual cultivators regarding the objects of their own profession, however new they may as yet be in the annals of agriculture, are far more likely to prove useful than the writings of those volunteers in this favourite science, who are merely speculative and theoretical. I freely confess to you, Sir, that I found with pleasure your work widely circulated in the sister kingdom; and that the cause uniformly given for its popularity, was a degree of confidence placed in the practical skill of its conductor.\n\n\"During my progress through Ireland, the several processes of steeping, drying, and skutching, were in hand, and I think I found a peculiarity of management in these sufficient to affect the success of the whole business, and to confer a decided superiority on the produce of an acre of flax in Ireland over that in Scotland, both in quantity and value. It is no uncommon thing for a farmer in this country, who wishes to make up a sum for his rent, to sell a part of his lint on the foot, as it is termed; and for this he will commonly receive from 30 to 40 guineas per acre.\n\n\"1. The Method of Steeping.\u2014As soon as the crop has attained the proper degree of ripeness, (which is somewhat below your standard of maturity), the flax is pulled, and carried to a stagnant pool, dug for this purpose, moderately deep. It is allowed to remain there only from five to seven days, according to the temperature of the weather. After the fermentation in the steeping process has been carried to a degree sufficient to produce the requisite laxity of fibre, the flax is taken out of the pool, and spread very thinly on the stubble of the hay meadow. There, instead of remaining till it is merely dried, it is continued for three or four weeks, till the grower conceives it ready for skutching. This bleaching process, if I am allowed to call it so, which, in Scotland, is either unknown, or continued merely till the crop is dried, has many advantages; the most obvious one is, that it enables the farmer, every time, to examine it, to ascertain exactly (by rubbing on his hand) the precise point at which the fermentation has arrived, and thus to perceive the tenacity and strength of his flax; while the adhesion of the fibre has been sufficiently weakened, to admit of the skutter cleaning it completely of the woody parts. It is, I am apprehensive, only the practical flax farmer who is able to judge of the importance and delicacy of this part of the husbandry. It is so remarkable, that of two acres of flax, under precisely the same seed and culture, and of equal fertility, it frequently happens that the one shall yield a produce thrice the value of the other, merely from superior accuracy in ascertaining the proper line of continuing the steeping and bleaching processes. In Scotland, therefore, I suspect the practice is faulty and defective; because there the whole process of fermentation is completed by steeping alone; whereas, in Ireland, it is begun only in the steep, and completed by bleaching on the meadow, to that precise point which the safety of the produce requires.\n\n\"2. Smoking and Drying.\u2014The Irish peasant seems to possess another advantage, almost equally decisive, in his mode of drying the flax, before he submits it to the skutter or beater. After the lint has remained a sufficient length of time on the bleaching green, it is gathered up a second time into sheafs, (beats, provincially), and seems tolerably dry. In this state it is deemed by the Scots growers fully prepared for the flax-mill; but far otherwise by the Irish farmer, who never submits it to the hands of the beaters till it has undergone a thorough smoking over a peat fire. For this purpose, he raises, at the back of a ditch, a small hurdle thinly wrought with osiers, and places it on four posts of wood, at the height of four feet above the level of the ground. A pretty strong fire of peats being kindled below, the heat and smoke pervade every part of the flax, which is placed perpendicularly above the hurdle. This process is continued, and fresh quantities of flax regularly added, till the whole crop is brought to a state of dryness, which, in this moist climate, can never be effected by the sun and the weather alone: by this operation a degree of brittleness and friability is produced on the flax, which greatly facilitates the ensuing work, and admits of an easy separation of the fibre from the wood. It is evident, that the less friction required in skutching, the less waste or diminution must be occasioned in clearing the flax; and consequently, the greater must be the grower's produce from the mill. This part of the process is equally delicate with that described above, and requires, if possible, still greater attention on the part of the workmen, since it is clear that, by a careless management of the fire, the whole crop may be destroyed.\n\n\"3. Cleaning and Dressing.\u2014The flax husbandry of Ireland derives no small benefit from the application of hand-labour in the beating and skutching of lint, thus superfluousing the use of the mill. The most careful and expert workmen are not always able to temper the velocity of machinery so exactly, as to preserve flax that has been oversteeped or bleached to excess: while the steady and regulated impetus of the hand-skutch can easily be modified, as the circumstances of each case may require; a matter of obvious advantage, because the best flax-mills seldom produce an equal quantity of lint, nor equally clean, with that which is obtained by the hand. Besides this, the price of labour, in this part of the united kingdom, still continues so moderate, as to preclude any considerable degree of saving in expense.\"\npence by the use of machinery. In proof of this, the flax millers in Scotland, I find, are charging this season from three to four shillings for dressing a stone of flax; while, at the place I am now writing, the same quantity is dressed by the hand for threepence, or one British shilling. In Scotland, where hands are scarce, and the price of labour consequently high, I certainly would not recommend the difuse of the flax-mill; on the contrary, I am persuaded that it is chiefly owing to our superior machinery, and excellent implements of husbandry, that we are at all enabled to maintain a competition with our neighbours in the present state of our skill in flax husbandry, and subjected to the disadvantage of paying double price for our labour.\n\n\"4. Preservation of Flax-feed.\u2014The last peculiarity of management, which I shall at present notice as advantageous to the flax husbandry of Ireland, is the invention of a flax barn for the preservation of feed. Enjoying a climate perhaps still more moist and unsteady than that of Great Britain, the farmers here were for a long series of years, unable to supply themselves with this article, and were obliged to commission feed annually from America and the Baltic, to supply the increased demands of an extending culture, to the large amount of 200,000l. sterling. This annual expenditure of cash long continued to operate as a drain on the stock of the laborious farmer, and prevented the accumulation of his capital; an evil of the most serious magnitude, under which the Irish peasantry still labour, and from which, till very lately, they had not even a prospect of relief. By the practice in universal use, if the farmer stored up his lint in the barn-yard with the rest of his crop in harvest, he might, it is true, preserve his feed; but in doing so, he uniformly lost his flax to a far greater value from overdryness, when wrought in the spring.\n\n\"If, on the other hand, he attempted to separate his feed during the lint harvest by means of the rippling-comb, he had no means of preventing it from being almost invariably destroyed by the wetness of the climate. Various methods had been attempted to overcome this difficulty, but without success; till Robert Tennant, Esq. of Strangmore, linen-inspector, near Dungannon, contrived the plan of a flax-barn, which seems perfectly competent to the preservation of feed. It has already been erected, and has proved successful on a small scale; the feed cured in it remained during the winter perfectly fresh, and nothing seems wanting to complete this improvement in our flax husbandry, but a larger capital in the hands of a few of our farmers. This flax barn is constructed on wooden potts, roofed on the top, but left perfectly open at each side; it is supplied with various stages of floors of basket-work, placed regularly at two feet distance above each other. Thus, the air, having free access to the feed on all sides, preserves it fresh and well-coloured for any length of time.\n\n\"This contrivance was suggested to Mr Tennant, it is said, almost casually, by noticing the great effect produced on cloth, by drying-houses in bleachfields. He had in fact been employed by the Linen Board of Ireland, in teaching the new process of bleaching to the manufacturers, by means of the oxymuriate of lime; and, in the course of seven or eight years, this method of whitening linen has been established over the whole kingdom, with the exception of hardly a single field. Lord Northland and Mr Foster, who invited this gentleman from Scotland, and patronized him in this part of the kingdom, have enjoyed the satisfaction of beholding a more essential improvement effected in the linen manufacture, in the short space already mentioned, than had ever taken place in a century before.\n\n\"It was my intention, when I began this letter, to have prefaced you a more minute description of a flax farm, and to have laid before your readers, a more detailed account of the flax husbandry of Ireland in general. I find, however, that I have already exceeded the ordinary bounds prescribed to the contributors to your useful work; therefore conclude, with expressing a hope, that the few hints already offered, will incline some of your correspondents to treat of a subject certainly of sufficient importance to merit attention. For a branch of husbandry cannot be deemed contemptible, which affords sustenance to upwards of two millions of people; and which, at the same time, adds to the general resources of the empire, no less a sum than seven millions sterling annually. These circumstances, too, I trust, will plead my excuse for holding up a portion of Irish husbandry to the imitation of your numerous readers among the cultivators of Scotland, who are at present justly celebrated for their agricultural knowledge in every part of the world.\"\n\nFlax made to resemble Cotton. In the Swedish Transactions for the year 1747, a method is given of preparing flax in such a manner as to resemble cotton in whiteness and softness, as well as in coherence. For this purpose, a little sea water is to be put into an iron pot or an untinned copper kettle, and a mixture of equal parts of birch ashes and quicklime strewed upon it: A small bundle of flax is to be opened and spread upon the surface, and covered with more of the mixture, and the stratification continued till the vessel is sufficiently filled. The whole is then to be boiled with sea water for ten hours; fresh quantities of water being occasionally supplied in proportion to the evaporation, that the water may never become dry. The boiled flax is to be immediately washed in the sea by a little at a time, in a basket, with a smooth stick at first while hot; and when grown cold enough to be borne by the hands, it must be well rubbed; washed with soap, laid to bleach, and turned and watered every day. Repetitions of the washing with soap expedite the bleaching; after which the flax is to be beaten, and again well washed; when dry it is to be worked and carded in the same manner as common cotton, and pressed between two boards for 48 hours. It is now fully prepared and fit for use. It loses in this process near one half its weight, which is abundantly compensated by the improvement made in its quality.\n\nThe filamentous parts of different vegetables have been employed in different countries for the same mechanic uses as hemp and flax among us.

See Beaumont and Fletcher.\n\nFletcher, Andrew, of Salton, a celebrated Scots patriot and political writer, was descended from an ancient family who trace their origin to one of the followers of William the Conqueror. He was the son of Sir Robert Fletcher of Salton and Innerpeffer, and born in the year 1653. The tuition of our author was committed by his father, on his deathbed, to Mr (afterwards Bishop) Burnet, then his parish minister; by whose care he received a pious, learned, and polite education. Endowed with uncommon genius, and possessed of virtues and abilities peculiarly suited to the times in which he lived, Mr Fletcher quickly shone forth the ornament of his country, and the champion of its freedom. Having in the course of his classical studies and historical reading been impressed with an enthusiastic admiration both of ancient and modern republics, he had early contracted an ardent love of liberty, and an aversion to arbitrary rule. Hence his spirit the more readily took alarm at certain measures in the reign of Charles II. Being knight of the shire for Lothian to that parliament where the duke of York was commissioner, he openly opposed the designs of that prince and the bill of accession. He had a share with lord viscount Stair in framing the test act, by which the duke of York complained that he lost Scotland. On these accounts he became peculiarly obnoxious to the duke; and was at last obliged to flee to Holland, to avoid the fatal consequences of prosecutions which on various pretences were commenced against him. Being cited before the privy council and judiciary courts, and not appearing, he was declared traitor, and Fletcher, his estate confiscated.\n\nIn Holland, he and Mr Baillie of Jerviswood were the only persons whom the earl of Argyle consulted concerning the designs which were then in agitation. In 1681 they came over to England, in order to concert matters with their party in that country; and were the only two who were intrusted to far as to be admitted to the secrets of Lord Ruffell's council of five. Mr Fletcher managed his part of the negotiation with so much address, that administration could find no pretext for seizing him; nor could they fix upon him those articles on account of which Mr Baillie was condemned; to whose honour let it be remembered, that although offered a pardon on condition of his accusing his friend, he persisted in rejecting the proposal with indignation.\n\nMr Fletcher having joined the duke of Monmouth upon his landing, received a principal command under him; but the duke was deprived of his services on the following occasion, as related by Sir John Dalrymple. Being sent upon an expedition, and not Great Britain esteeming \"times of danger to be times of ceremony\" and Ireland, he had feigned for his own riding the horse of a country gentleman [the mayor of Lynne] which stood ready equipped for its master. The matter, hearing this, ran in a passion to Fletcher, gave him opprobrious language, shook his cane, and attempted to strike. Fletcher, though rigid in the duties of morality, having been accustomed to foreign service both by sea and land, in which he had acquired high ideas of the honour of a soldier and a gentleman, and of the affront of a cane, pulled out his pistol, and shot him dead on the spot. The action was unpopular in countries where such refinements were not understood. A clamour was raised against it among the people of the country; in a body they waited upon the duke with their complaints; and he was forced to desire the only soldier, and almost the only man of parts, in his army, to abandon him. With Fletcher all Monmouth's chance of success in war left him.\" But, in a manuscript memoir belonging to the family, we have the following notice concerning Mr Fletcher's connection with Monmouth, in which his separation from that prince is very differently accounted for: \"To Lord Marischal Mr Fletcher explained the motives which first induced him to join, and afterwards abandon, the duke of Monmouth. The former he ascribed to the duke's manifesto in Scotland relating to religion, and in England to liberty. For the latter he accounted by the dilguit produced in his own mind and that of his associates, when the duke declared himself king, and broke faith with all who embarked with him on his principles. He complained heavily of the account commonly given of the death of the mayor of Lynne; and mentioned to Lord Marischal, in proof of the contrary, that he did not leave the duke till he came to Taunton, where he was proclaimed king, several weeks after the death of the mayor of Lynne.\"\n\nSeeing all the efforts of himself and his friends in favour of liberty frustrated at Taunton, he endeavoured to secure his own personal freedom by taking his passage in the first ship bound to a foreign country. It was his misfortune to land in Spain; where he was immediately arrested, cast into prison, and guarded by three\nFletcher, three different bands of soldiers, till a vessel should be prepared to carry him a victim in chains to the court of London. But on the morning before the ship could fail, whilst he looked pensive through the bars that secured the window of his room, he was hailed by a venerable personage who made signs to speak with him. The prison doors he found open; and whilst his friendly conductor waved to him to follow him, he passed through three different guards of soldiers all fast asleep. Without being permitted to offer his thanks to his deliverer, he found himself obliged to prosecute with all speed the journey, in which he was directed by a person concerning whom he could never collect any information; and in disguise he proceeded in safety through Spain. He felt a peculiar pleasure in relating to his friends instances of the care of Providence which he had experienced during his exile; and entertained them often with narratives of this kind, which he always mingled with religious reflections. Of these, another may be here mentioned. Happening in the evening to pass the skirt of a wood at a few miles distance from a city where he intended to lodge, he came to a place where two roads met. After he had entered upon the road on the right, he was accosted by a female of a respectable figure, who warned him to turn back, and take the road on the left; for that in the other there was danger which he could not escape if he continued to proceed. His friendly monitor suddenly retired into the wood, out of which he had issued no less unexpectedly. Having arrived at the city, the inhabitants were soon after alarmed by an account of the robbery and murder of several travellers who that evening had fallen into the hands of a banditti upon the very way in which he had intended to travel. From these and other instances of preservation from dangers, the devotion of his mind, habituated from his infancy to an intercourse with heaven, led him to conclude that he was in a peculiar manner the care of Providence, and that in critical cases his understanding received its direction from a supernatural impulse.\n\nDuring his exile, he maintained a frequent and extensive correspondence with the friends of liberty at home; and he partly employed himself in making a curious collection of books, which compose the best private library in Scotland. But his genius also prompted him to engage in more active employments. He repaired to Hungary, and served several campaigns as a volunteer under the duke of Lorraine with great reputation. At length, understanding that the great design then projecting in Holland, and upon the issue of which he considered the liberties of Britain to be suspended, had attained a considerable degree of maturity, he hastened thither; where his councils and addresses were of eminent service. He came over with King William; and in zeal, activity, penetration, and political skill, proved inferior to none of the leaders in the Revolution.\n\nSuch, however, was his magnanimity, that from a survey of King William's papers it appears, that while others laboured to turn this grand event to the emolument of themselves and the aggrandisement of their family, Mr Fletcher asked nothing. His estate had been forfeited, and his house abandoned to military discretion; his fortune was greatly shattered, and his family reduced to circumstances of distress. Nothing was given him in recompense of all his sufferings. On the contrary, he, together with the duke of Hamilton, was distinguished by marks of royal and ministerial dislike. Still, whatever private resentment he might entertain, it appeared that his ruling principle was the good of his country; and that to this grand object of his heart he was willing to sacrifice all personal considerations. For when, in 1692, the abdicated king meditated an invasion, Mr Fletcher addressed a letter (preserved in Sir John Dalrymple's collection) to the duke of Hamilton, in which every argument is employed with skill and energy to engage his grace to forget his injuries, and in the present crisis to employ the extensive influence and authority he then possessed in the cause of freedom and of his country. This letter produced its full effect; and the duke returned to his duty, from which he had in part begun to deviate.\n\nTo follow our author through all the mazes of his political life subsequent to the Revolution, is beyond our purpose, and would exceed our limits. One or two circumstances more shall therefore suffice. Being elected a member for the parliament 1683, he showed an uniform zeal for the interest of his country. The thought of England's domineering over Scotland was what his generous soul could not endure. The indignities and opprobrium which Scotland lay under galled him to the heart; so that in his learned and elaborate discourses, he exposed them with undaunted courage and pathetic eloquence. In that great event, the Union, he performed essential service. He got the act of security passed, which declared that the two crowns should not pass to the same head till Scotland was secured in her liberties civil and religious. Therefore Lord Godolphin was forced into the Union, to avoid a civil war after the queen's demise. Although Mr Fletcher disapproved of some of the articles, and indeed of the whole frame of the Union; yet, as the act of security was his own work, he had all the merit of that important transaction.\n\nWe must not omit mentioning, that in the ardour of his political career Mr Fletcher forgot not the interests of the place that gave him birth. He esteemed the education of youth one of the noblest objects of government. On this subject he wrote a treatise, still extant, most characteristic of himself; and he established at Salton a foundation for the same purpose, of great utility while it lasted.\n\nThis great man died at London 1716, aged 66. His remains were conveyed to Scotland, and deposited in the family vault at Salton.\n\nThat Mr Fletcher received neither honours nor emoluments from King William, may perhaps be in part attributed to himself; a circumstance, however, which must add greatly to the lustre of his character. His uncomplying virtue, and the firmness of his principles, were ill calculated to conciliate courtly favour. He was so zealous an adherent of the liberties of the people, that he was too jealous of the growing power of all princes; in whom he thought ambition so natural, that he was not for trusting the best of kings with the power which ill ones might make use of against their subjects; he was of opinion that all princes were made by, and for the benefit of, the people; and that they should have no power but that of doing good. This, which\nwhich made him oppose King Charles and invade King James, led him also to oppose the giving so much power to King William, whom he would never serve after his establishment. So we are told by the author of Short Political Characters, a M.S. in the library of the late T. Rawlinson, Esq.\u2014Mr Lockhart, in his Memoirs, p. 72, expresses a belief that his aversion to the English and to the Union was so great, that, in revenge to them, he was inclined to side with the abdicated family: \u201cBut (adds he) as that was a subject not fit to be entered upon with him, this is only a conjecture from some inuendos I have heard him make; but so far is certain, he liked, commended, and conversed with high-flying Torics, more than any other set of men; acknowledging them to be the best countrymen, and of most honour, integrity, and ingenuity.\u201d It seems difficult to reconcile this with Mr Fletcher\u2019s avowed principles and the general tenor of his conduct. May we suppose, that, chagrining, if not at the neglect or the ill treatment which he had himself received from government since the Revolution, yet at the public measures relating to his native country, might have occasioned him to relent in his sentiments with regard to the exiled family?\u2014In the family memoirs already quoted, we are informed, That \u201cLord Marischal held Mr Fletcher\u2019s character in high admiration;\u201d and that, \u201cwhen governor of Neufchatel, where Rousseau resided about the year 1766, he prevailed with this very extraordinary genius to write the life of a man whose character and actions he wished to have transmitted to posterity with advantage. For this purpose, his lordship applied to an honourable relation of Mr Fletcher\u2019s for materials; which by him were transmitted to Lord Marischal; but the design failed through Rousseau\u2019s deftly and capricious disposition.\u201d This anecdote must appear incompatible with the known loyalty and attachments of the Earl Marischal, unless we suppose him to have been privy to some such sentiments of Mr Fletcher as those alluded to by Mr Lockhart; for how could we suppose him anxious to promote a composition, in which the task would be to celebrate principles diametrically opposite to his own, and to applaud actions subversive of that royal family in whose cause he had ventured his life, and forfeited his fortune, and foregone his country!\u2014But however these circumstances may be reconciled, as the integrity, disinterestedness, and public spirit of Mr Fletcher, have been universally acknowledged, there is reason to believe, that all his sentiments and actions were founded in honour, and that he never once pursued a measure rather than he judged it to be for the interest of his country.\n\nMr Fletcher was master of the English, Latin, Greek, French, and Italian languages; and well versed in history, the civil law, and all kinds of learning. In his travels, he had not only acquired considerable knowledge in the art of war, but also became versant in the respective interests of the several princes and states of Europe. In private life, he was affable to his friends, and free from all manner of vice. He had a penetrating, clear, and lively apprehension; but is said to have been too much wedded to opinions, and impatient of contradiction.\u2014He possessed an uncommon elevation of mind, accompanied with a warmth of temper, which would suffer him to brook from no rank among men, nor in any place, an indignity. Of this Fletcherwood he exhibited a singular proof in the Scots parliament. The earl of Stair, secretary of state and minister for Scotland, having in the heat of debate used an improper expression against Mr Fletcher, he seized him by his robe, and inflicted upon public and immediate satisfaction. His lordship was obliged instantly to beg his pardon in presence of parliament.\n\nMr Fletcher was by far the finest speaker in the parliament of Scotland; the earl of Stair alone rivalled him. The latter was famed for a splendid, the former for a close and nervous, eloquence. He formed his style on the models of antiquity; and the small volume of his works, Sir John Dalrymple observes, though imperfectly collected, is one of the very few classical compositions in the English language.","sp":302,"ep":305},{"h":"FLETWOOD","t":"WILLIAM, an eminent English lawyer and recorder of London, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.

To be able to accomplish this, it is necessary to understand the principles on which that stability and these positions depend. This has been done with great ingenuity by Mr Atwood, of whose reasoning the following is a summary account, taken from the Philosophical Transactions for 1796.\n\nA floating body is pressed downwards by its own weight in a vertical line passing through its centre of gravity; and it is supported by the upward pressure of a fluid, which acts in a vertical line that passes through the centre of gravity of the part which is under the water;\nFloating Bodies.\n\nwater; and without a coincidence between these two lines, in such a manner as that both centres of gravity may be in the same vertical line, the solid will turn on an axis, till it gains a position in which the equilibrium of floating will be permanent. From this it is obviously necessary to find what proportion the part immersed bears to the whole, to do which the specific gravity of the floating body must be known, after which it must be found by geometrical methods, in what positions the solid can be placed on the surface of the fluid, so that both centres of gravity may be in the same vertical line, when any given part of the solid is immersed under the surface. These things being determined, something is still wanting, for positions may be assumed in which the circumstances now mentioned concur, and yet the solid will assume some other position wherein it will permanently float. If the specific gravity of a cylinder be to that of the fluid on which it floats as 3 to 4, and its axis to the diameter of the base as 2 to 1; if it be placed on the fluid with its axis vertical, it will sink to a depth equal to a diameter and a half of the base; and while its axis is preserved in a vertical position by outward force, the centres of gravity of the whole solid and immersed part will remain in the same vertical line; but when the external force is removed, it will deviate from its upright position, and will permanently float with its axis horizontal. If we suppose the axis to be half the diameter of the base, and placed vertically, the solid will sink to the depth of three-eighths of its diameter, and in that position it will float permanently. If the axis be made to incline to the vertical line, the solid will change its position till it permanently settles with its axis perpendicular to the horizon.\n\nWhether a solid floats permanently, or overflows when placed on the surface of a fluid, provided the centre of gravity of the solid and that of the immersed part be in the same vertical line, it is said to be in a position of equilibrium, of which there are three kinds; the equilibrium of stability, in which the solid permanently floats in a given position; the equilibrium of instability, in which the solid spontaneously overflows, if not supported by external force; and the equilibrium of indifference, or the insensible equilibrium, in which the solid rests on the fluid indifferent to motion, without tendency to right itself when inclined, or to incline farther.\n\nIf a solid body floats permanently on the surface of a fluid, and external force be applied to turn it from its position, the resistance opposed to this inclination is termed the stability of floating. Some ships at sea yield to a given impulse of the wind, and suffer a greater inclination from the perpendicular than others. As this resistance to heeling, duly regulated, has been considered of importance in the construction of vessels, many eminent mathematicians have laid down rules for ascertaining the stability of ships from their known dimensions and weight, without recurring to actual experiment. Bouguer, Euler, Chapman, and others, have laid down theorems for this purpose, founded on the supposition that the inclinations of ships from their quiescent positions are evanescent, or very small in a practical point of view. But ships at sea have been found to heel 10\u00b0, 25\u00b0, or 30\u00b0, and therefore it may be doubted how far such rules are applicable in practice. If statics can be applied to naval architecture, it seems necessary that the rules should be extended to those cases in which the angles of inclination are of any magnitude, likely to occur in the practice of navigation. A solid body placed on the surface of a lighter fluid, at such a depth as corresponds to the relative gravities, cannot alter its position by the joint action of its own weight and the pressure of the fluid, except by turning on some horizontal axis passing through the centre of gravity; but, as many axes may be drawn through this point of the floating body, in a direction parallel to the horizon, and the motion of the solid regards only one axis, this must be determined by the figure of the body and the particular nature of the case. When this axis of motion is ascertained, and the specific gravity of the solid found, the positions of permanent floating will be determined, by finding the several positions of equilibrium through which the solid may be conceived to pass, while it turns round the axis of motion; and by determining in which of these positions the equilibrium is permanent, and in which of them it is momentary.\n\nThe whole of Mr Atwood's valuable paper relates to the theory of naval architecture, in so far as it is dependent on the laws of pure mechanics. If the proportions and dimensions adopted in the construction of individual vessels are obtained by exact geometrical measurement, and observations are made on the performance of these vessels at sea; a sufficient number of experiments of this nature judiciously varied, are the proper grounds on which theory may be effectually applied, in reducing to system those hitherto unperceived causes, which contribute to give the greatest degree of excellence to vessels of every description. Naval architecture being reckoned among the practical branches of science, every voyage may be viewed in the light of an experiment, from which useful truths are to be deduced. But inferences of this nature cannot well be obtained, except by acquiring a thorough knowledge of all the proportions and dimensions of each part of the ship, and by making a sufficient number of observations on the qualities of the vessel, in all the varieties of situation to which a ship is commonly subject in the practice of navigation.\n\nThe following is an ingenious investigation of the same subject by Mr English, which we give in his own words.\n\n\"However operose and difficult (says he) the calculations necessary to determine the stability of nautical vessels may, in some cases, be, yet they all depend, says this author, upon the four following simple and obvious theorems, accompanied with other well known stereometrical and statical principles.\n\n\"Theorem 1. Every floating body displaces a quantity of the fluid in which it floats, equal to its own weight; and consequently, the specific gravity of the fluid will be to that of the floating body, as the magnitude of the whole is to that of the part immersed.\n\n\"Theorem 2. Every floating body is impelled downward by its own essential power, acting in the direction of a vertical line passing through the centre of gravity of the whole; and is impelled upward by the reaction of the fluid which supports it, acting in the direction of a vertical line passing through the centre of gravity of the part immersed; therefore, unless these two lines are coincident, the floating body thus impelled must revolve round an axis, either in motion or at rest, until the equilibrium is restored.\n\n\"Theorem 3. If by any power whatever a vessel be deflected...\"\ndeflected from an upright position, the perpendicular distance between two vertical lines passing through the centres of gravity of the whole, and of the part immersed respectively, will be as the stability of the vessel, and which will be positive, nothing, or negative, according as the metacentre is above, coincident with, or below, the centre of gravity of the vessel.\n\n\"Theorem 4. The common centre of gravity of any system of bodies being given in position, if any one of these bodies be moved from one part of the system to another, the corresponding motion of the common centre of gravity, estimated in any given direction, will be to that of the aforementioned body, estimated in the same direction, as the weight of the body moved is to that of the whole system.\n\n\"From whence it is evident, that in order to ascertain the stability of any vessel, the position of the centres of gravity of the whole, and of that part immersed, must be determined; with which, and the dimensions of the vessel, the line of floatation, and angle of deflection, the stability or power either to right itself or overturn, may be found.\n\n\"In ships of war and merchandise, the calculations necessary for the purpose become unavoidably very perplexing and troublesome; but they may be much facilitated by the experimental method pointed out in the New Transactions of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, first quarter of the year 1787, page 48.\n\n\"In river and canal boats, the regularity and simplicity of the form of the vessel itself, together with the compact disposition and homogeneous quality of the burden, render that method for them unnecessary, and make the requisite calculations become very easy. Vessels of this kind are generally of the same transverse section throughout their whole length, except a small part in prow and stern, formed by segments of circles or other simple curves; therefore a length may easily be assigned such, that any of the transverse sections being multiplied thereby, the product will be equal to the whole solidity of the vessel. The form of the section ABCD is for the most part either rectangular, as in fig. 1. Plate CCXVIII., trapezoidal as in fig. 2, or mixtilinear as in fig. 3, in all which MM represents the line of floatation when upright, and EF that when inclined at any angle MXE; also G represents the centre of gravity of the whole vessel, and R that of the part immersed.\n\n\"If the vessel be loaded quite up to the line AB, and the specific gravity of the boat and burden be the same, then the point G is simply the centre of gravity of the section ABCD; but if not, the centres of gravity of the boat and burden must be found separately, and reduced to one by the common method, namely, by dividing the sum of the momenta by the sum of weights, or areas, which in this case are as the weights. The point R is always the centre of gravity of the section MMCD, which, if consisting of different figures, must also be found by dividing the sum of the momenta by the sum of the weights as common. These two points being found, the next thing necessary is to determine the area of the two equal triangles MXE, M XF, their centres of gravity o, o, and the perpendicular projected distance n n of these points on the water line EF. This being done, through R and parallel to EF draw RT = a fourth proportional to the whole area MMCD, either triangle MXE or M XF, and the distance n n; through T, and at right angles to RT or EF, draw TS meeting the vertical axis of the vessel in S the metacentre; also through the points G, B, and parallel to ST, draw NGW and BV; moreover through S, and parallel to EF, draw WSV, meeting the two former in V and W; then SW is as the stability of the vessel, which will be positive, nothing, or negative, according as the point S is above, coincident with, or below, the point G. If now we suppose W to represent the weight of the whole vessel and burden (which will be equal to the section MMCD multiplied by the length of the vessel), and P to represent the required weight applied at the gunwale B to sustain the vessel at the given angle or inclination; we shall always have this proportion: as VS : SW :: W : P; which proportion is general, whether SW be positive or negative; it must only in the latter case be supposed to act upward to prevent an overturn.\n\n\"In the rectangular vessel, of given weight and dimensions, the whole process is so evident, that any farther explanation would be unnecessary. In the trapezoidal vessel, after having found the points G and R, let AD, BC be produced until they meet in K. Then, since the two sections MMCD, EFDC are equal; the two triangles MMK, EFK are also equal; and therefore the rectangle EK \u00d7 KF = KM \u00d7 KM = KM\u00b2; and since the angle of inclination is supposed to be known, the angles at E and F are given. Consequently, if a mean proportional be found between the sines of the angle at E and F, we shall have the following proportions:\n\n\"As the mean proportional thus found: fine \u2220E :: KM : KF, and in the said mean proportional: fine \u2220F :: KM : KE; therefore ME, MF become known; from whence the area of either triangle MXE or M XF, the distance n n, and all the other requisites, may be found.\n\n\"In the mixtilinear section, let AB = 9 feet = 108 inches, the whole depth = 6 feet = 72 inches, and the altitude of MM the line of floatation 4 feet or 48 inches; also let the two curvilinear parts be circular quadrants of two feet, or 24 inches radius each. Then the area of the two quadrants = 904.7808 square inches, and the distance of their centres of gravity from the bottom = 13.8177 inches very nearly; also the area of the included rectangle abie = 1440 square inches, and the altitude of its centre of gravity 12 inches; in like manner, the area of the rectangle ABCD will be found = 5184 square inches, and the altitude of its centre of gravity 48 inches: therefore we shall have\n\nMomentum of the two quadrants = 904.7808 \u00d7 13.8177 = 12501.9896016\n\nMoment of the rectangle abie = 1440 \u00d7 12 = 17280\n\nMoment of the rectangle ABCD = 5184 \u00d7 48 = 248832\n\nNow the sum of the momenta, divided by the sum of the areas, will give \\(\\frac{2786139896016}{75287808} = 37006\\) inches, the altitude of G, the centre of gravity of the section.\nFloating section ABCD above the bottom. In like manner, Bodies the altitude of R, the centre of gravity of the section Flooding, MMCD, will be found to be equal\n\n\\[ \\frac{12309378966016}{49367808} = 24'934 \\text{ inches; and consequently their difference, or the value of GR } = 12'072 \\text{ inches, will be found.} \\]\n\nSuppose the vessel to heel 15\u00b0, and we shall have the following proportion; namely, As radius : tangent of 15\u00b0 :: MX = 54 inches : 14'469 inches = ME or MF; and consequently the area of either triangle MXE or MXF = 39\u00b0663 square inches. Therefore, by theorem 4th, as 49367808 : 39\u00b0663 :: 72 = n = \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) AB : 5'6975 inches = RT; and, again, as radius: fine of 15\u00b0 :: 12'072 = GR : 3'1245 inches = RN; consequently RT - RN = 5'6975 - 3'1245 = 2'573 inches = SW, the stability required.\n\nMoreover, as the fine of 15\u00b0 : radius :: 5'6975 = RT : 22'013 = RS, to which, if we add 24'934, the altitude of the point R, we shall have 46'947 for the height of the metacentre, which taken from 72, the whole altitude, there remains 25'033; from which, and the half width = 54 inches, the distance BS is found = 59'529 inches very nearly, and the angle SBV = 80\u00b0 - 56' - 4'2\"; from whence SV = 58'645 inches.\n\nAgain: Let us suppose the mean length of the vessel to be 40 feet, or 480 inches, and we shall have the weight of the whole vessel equal to the area of the section MMCD = 49367808 multiplied by 480 = 2360654784 cubic inches of water, which weighs exactly 85708 pounds avoirdupois, allowing the cubic foot to weigh 62.5 pounds.\n\nAnd, finally, as SV : SW (i.e.) as 58'645 : 2'573 :: 85708 : 3760 + , the weight on the gunwale which will sustain the vessel at the given inclination. Therefore a vessel of the above dimensions, and weighing 38 tons 5 cwt. 28 lbs. will require a weight of 1 ton 13 cwt. 64 lbs. to make her incline 15\u00b0.\n\nIn this example the deflecting power has been supposed to act perpendicularly on the gunwale at B; but if the vessel is navigated by sails, the centre velique must be found; with which and the angle of deflection, the projected distance thereof on the line SV may be obtained; and then the power calculated as above, necessary to be applied at the projected point, will be that part of the wind's force which causes the vessel to heel. And conversely, if the weight and dimensions of the vessel, the area and altitude of the sails, the direction and velocity of the wind be given, the angle of deflection may be found.*\n\n* Phil.

The load or quantity of ore is frequently intercepted in its course by the crossing of a vein of earth or stone, or some different metallic substance; in which case the load is moved to one side, and this transient part of the land is called a flooding.\n\nFloor, in building, the underside of a room, or that part we walk on.\n\nFloors are of several sorts; some of earth, some of brick, others of stone, others of boards, &c.\n\nFor brick and stone Floors, see Pavement.\n\nFor boarded Floors, it is observable that the carpenters never floor their rooms with boards till the carcass is set up, and also enclosed with walls, lest the weather should injure the flooring. Yet they generally rough-plane their boards for the flooring before they begin any thing else about the building, that they may let them by to dry and season, which is done in the most careful manner. The best wood for flooring is the fine yellow deal well seasoned, which when well laid, will keep its colour for a long while; whereas the white sort becomes black by often washing, and looks very bad. The joints of the boards are commonly made plain, so as to touch each other only; but, when the fluff is not quite dry, and the boards shrink, the water runs through them whenever the floor is walked, and injures the ceiling underneath. For this reason they are made with feather edges, so as to cover each other about half an inch, and sometimes they are made with grooves and tenons; and sometimes the joints are made with dove tails; in which case the lower edge is nailed down, and the next drove into it, so that the nails are concealed. The manner of measuring floors is by squares of 10 feet on each side, so that taking the length and breadth, and multiplying them together and cutting off two decimals, the content of a floor in square will be given. Thus 18 by 16 gives 288 or 2 squares and 88 decimal parts.\n\nEarthen Floors, are commonly made of loam, and sometimes, especially to make malt on, of lime, and brook sand, and gun dust, or anvil dust from the forge.\n\nOx blood and fine clay, tempered together, Sir Hugh Plat says, make the finest floor in the world.\n\nThe manner of making earthen floors for plain country habitations is as follows: Take two-thirds of lime, and one of coal ashes well fitted, with a small quantity of loam clay; mix the whole together, and temper it well with water, making it up into a heap: let it lie a week or ten days, and then temper it over again. After this, heap it up for three or four days, and repeat the tempering very high, till it become smooth, yielding, tough, and gluey. The ground being then levelled, lay the floor therewith about 2\u00bd of 3 inches thick, making it smooth with a trowel: the hotter the season is, the better; and when it is thoroughly dried, it will make the best floor for houses, especially malt houses.\n\nIf any one would have their floors look better, let them take lime made of rag stones, well tempered with whites of eggs, covering the floor about half an inch thick with it, before the under-flooring is too dry. If this be well done, and thoroughly dried, it will look when rubbed with a little oil as transparent as metal or glass. In elegant houses, floors of this nature are made of stucco, or of plaster of Paris beaten and sifted, and mixed with other ingredients.\nFloor of a Ship, strictly taken, is only so much of her bottom as she rests on when aground.\n\nSuch ships as have long, and withal broad floors, lie on the ground with most security, and are not apt to heel, or tilt on one side; whereas others, which are narrow in the floor, or in the sea phrase, cranked by the ground, cannot be grounded without danger of being overturned.\n\nFloor Timbers, in a ship, are those parts of a ship's timbers which are placed immediately across the keel, and upon which the bottom of the ship is framed; to these the upper parts of the timbers are united, being only a continuation of floor timbers upwards.","sp":306,"ep":310},{"h":"FLORA","t":"the reputed goddess of flowers, was, according to Lactantius, only a lady of pleasure, who having gained large sums of money by prostituting herself, made the Roman people her heir, on condition that certain games called Floralia might be annually celebrated on her birthday. Some time afterwards, however, such a foundation appearing unworthy the majesty of the Roman people, the senate, to ennoble the ceremony, converted Flora into a goddess, whom they supposed to preside over flowers; and so made it a part of religion to render her propitious, that it might be well with their gardens, vineyards, &c. But Vossius (de Idol. lib. i. c. 12.) can by no means allow the goddess Flora to have been the courtezans above mentioned: he will rather have her a Sabine deity, and thinks her worship might have commenced under Romulus. His reason is, that Varro, in his fourth book of the Latin tongue, ranks Flora among the deities to whom Tatius king of the Sabines offered up vows before he joined battle with the Romans. Add, that from another passage in Varro it appears, that there were priests of Flora, with sacrifices, &c. as early as the times of Romulus and Numa.\n\nThe goddess Flora was, according to the poets, the wife of Zephyrus. Her image in the temple of Caius and Pollux was draped in a close habit, and she held in her hands the flowers of peas and beans: but the modern poets and painters have been more lavish in setting off her charms, considering that no parts of nature offered such innocent and exquisite entertainment to the sight and smell, as the beautiful variety which adorns, and the odour which embalms, the floral creation.","sp":310,"ep":310},{"h":"FLORALES LUDI","t":"or FLORAL GAMES, in antiquity, were games held in honour of Flora, the goddess of flowers.\u2014They were celebrated with shameful debaucheries. The most licentious dissolute were not enough, but the courtezans were called together by the sound of a trumpet, made their appearance naked, and entertained the people with indecent shows and postures: the comedians appeared after the same manner on the stage. Val. Maximus relates, that Cato being once present in the theatre on this occasion, the people were ashamed to ask for such immodest representations in his presence; till Cato, apprised of the reservedness and respect with which he inspired them, withdrew, that the people might not be disappointed of their accustomed diversion. There were several other sorts of shows exhibited on this occasion; and, if we may believe Suetonius in Galba, c. 6. and\n\nVopiscus in Carinus, these princes presented elephants dancing on ropes on these occasions.\n\nThe ludi florales, according to Pliny, lib. xviii. c. 29., were instituted by order of an oracle of the Sibyls, on the 28th of April; not in the year of Rome 1066, as we commonly read it in the ancient editions of that author; nor in 1044, as E. Hardouin has corrected it, but, as Vossius reads it, in 513: though they were not regularly held every year till after 580. They were chiefly held in the night time, in the Patrician street: some will have it there was a circus for the purpose on the hill called Hortulorum.","sp":310,"ep":310},{"h":"FLORALIA","t":"in antiquity, a general name for the feasts, games, and other ceremonies, held in honour of the goddess Flora: See FLORA and FLORALES LUDI.","sp":310,"ep":310},{"h":"FLORENCE","t":"the capital of the duchy of Tuscany, and one of the finest cities in Italy. It is surrounded on all sides but one with high hills, which rise insensibly, and at last join with the lofty mountains called the Apennines. Towards Pisa, there is a vast plain of 40 miles in length; which is so filled with villages and pleasure houses, that they seem to be a continuation of the suburbs of the city. Independent of the churches and palaces of Florence, most of which are very magnificent, the architecture of the houses in general is in a good taste; and the streets are remarkably clean, and paved with large broad stones chiseled so as to prevent the horses from sliding. The city is divided into two unequal parts by the river Arno, over which there are no less than four bridges in sight of each other. That called the Ponte della Trinit\u00e0, which is uncommonly elegant, is built entirely of white marble, and ornamented with four beautiful statues representing the Seasons. The quays, the buildings on each side, and the bridges, render that part of Florence through which the river runs by far the finest. Every corner of this beautiful city is full of wonders in the arts of painting, statuary, and architecture. The streets, squares, and fronts of the palaces, are adorned with a great number of statues; some of them by the best modern masters, Michael Angelo, Bandinelli, Donatello, Giovanni di Bologna, Benvenuto Cellini, and others. Some of the Florentine merchants formerly were men of vast wealth, and lived in a most magnificent manner. One of them, about the middle of the fifteenth century, built that noble fabric, which, from the name of its founder, is still called the Palazzo Pitti. The man was ruined by the prodigious expense of this building, which was immediately purchased by the Medici family, and has continued ever since to be the residence of the sovereigns. The gardens belonging to this palace are on the declivity of an eminence. On the summit there is a kind of fort, called Belvedere. From this, and from some of the higher walks, you have a complete view of the city of Florence, and the beauteous vale of Arno, in the middle of which it stands. This palace has been enlarged since it was purchased from the ruined family of Pitti. The furniture is rich and curious, particularly some tables of Florentine work, which are much admired. The most precious ornaments, however, are the paintings. The walls of what is called the Imperial Chamber, are painted in fresco, by various painters; the subjects are allegorical, and in honour of Lorenzo of Medicis distinguished.\nFlorence, distinguished by the name of the Magnificent. The famous gallery attracts every stranger. One of the most interesting parts of it, in the eyes of many, is the series of Roman emperors, from Julius Caesar to Gallienus, with a considerable number of their empresses, arranged opposite to them. This series is almost complete; but wherever the bust of an emperor is wanting, the place is filled up by that of some other distinguished Roman. The celebrated Venus of Medici, which has been removed to Paris, is thought to be the standard of taste in female beauty and proportion, and stood formerly in a room called the Tribunal. The inscription on its base mentions its being made by Cleomenesian Athenian, the son of Apollodorus. It is of white marble, and surrounded by other masterpieces of sculpture, some of which are said to be the works of Praxiteles and other Greek masters. In the same room are many valuable curiosities, besides a collection of admirable pictures by the best masters. There are various other rooms, whose contents are indicated by the names they bear; as, the Cabinet of Arts, of Astronomy, of Natural History, of Medals, of Porcelain, of Antiquities; the Saloon of the Hermaphrodite, so called from a statue which divides the admiration of the amateurs with that in the Borghese villa at Rome, though the excellence of the execution is disfigured by the vileness of the subject; and the Gallery of Portraits, which contains the portraits of the most eminent painters (all executed by themselves) who have flourished in Europe during the three last centuries. Our limits will not admit of a detail of the hundredth part of the curiosities and buildings of Florence. We must not however omit mentioning the chapel of St Lorenzo, as being perhaps the finest and most expensive habitation that ever was reared for the dead; it is incrusted with precious stones, and adorned by the workmanship of the best modern sculptors. Mr Addison remarked, that this chapel advanced so slowly, that it is not impossible that the family of Medici may be extinct before their burial place is finished. This has actually taken place: the Medici family is extinct, and the chapel remains still unfinished.\n\nFlorence is a place of some strength, and contains an archbishop's see and an university. The number of inhabitants is calculated at 80,000. They boast of the improvements they have made in the Italian tongue, by means of their Academia della Crusca; and several other academies are now established at Florence. Though the Florentines affect great state, yet their nobility and gentry drive a retail trade in wine, which they sell from their cellar windows, and sometimes they even hang out a broken flask, as a sign where it may be bought. They deal, besides wine and fruits, in gold and silver stuffs. The Jews are not held in that degree of odium, or subjected to the same humiliating distinctions here, as in most other cities of Europe; and it is said that some of the richest merchants are of that religion.\n\nAs to the manners and amusements of the inhabitants, Dr Moore informs us, that \"besides the conversations which they have here, as in other towns of Italy, a number of the nobility meet every day at a house called the Cafino. This society is pretty much on the same footing with the clubs in London. The members are elected by ballot. They meet at no particular hour, but go at any time that is convenient. They play at billiards, cards, and other games, or continue conversing the whole evening, as they think proper. They are served with tea, coffee, lemonade, ices, or what other refreshments they choose; and each person pays for what he calls for. There is one material difference between this and the English clubs, that women as well as men are members. The company of both sexes behave with more frankness and familiarity to strangers as well as to each other, than is customary in public assemblies in other parts of Italy. The opera is a place where the people of quality pay and receive visits, and converse as freely as at the Cafino above mentioned. This occasions a continual passing and repassing to and from the boxes, except in those where there is a party of cards formed; it is then looked on as a piece of ill manners to disturb the players. From this it may be guessed, that here, as in some other towns in Italy, little attention is paid to the music by the company in the boxes, except at a new opera, or during some favourite air. But the dancers command a general attention: as soon as they begin, conversation ceases; even the card-players lay down their cards, and fix their eyes on the ballette. Yet the excellence of Italian dancing seems to consist in feats of strength, and a kind of jerking agility, more than in graceful movement. There is a continual contest among the performers, who shall spring highest. You see here none of the sprightly alluring gaiety of the French comic dancers, or of the graceful attitudes and smooth flowing motions of the performers in the serious opera at Paris. It is surprising that a people of such taste and sensibility as the Italians, should prefer a parcel of athletic jumpers to elegant dancers. On the evenings on which there is no opera, it is usual for the genteel company to drive to a public walk immediately without the city, where they remain till it begins to grow dark.\"\n\nE.

It was first discovered, in 1497, by Sebastian Cabot, a Venetian, then in the English service; whence a right to the country was claimed by the kings of England; and this province, as well as Georgia, was included in the charter granted by Charles II. to Carolina.\nIn 1512, however, Florida was more fully discovered by Ponce de Leon, an able Spanish navigator, but who undertook his voyage from the most absurd motives that can be well imagined. The Indians of the Caribbee islands had among them a tradition, that somewhene on the continent there was a fountain whose waters had the property of restoring youth to all old men who tasted them. The romantic imaginations of the Spaniards were delighted with this idea. Many embarked in voyages to find out this imaginary fountain, who were never afterwards heard of. Their superstitious countrymen never imagined that these people had perished. They concluded that they did not return, only because they had drunk of the immortalizing liquor, and had discovered a spot so delightful, that they did not choose to leave it. Ponce de Leon set out with this extravagant view as well as others, and fully persuaded of the existence of a third world, the conquest of which was to immortalize his name. In the attempt to discover this country, he rediscovered Florida; but returned to the place from whence he came, visibly more advanced in years than when he set out.\n\nFor some time this country was neglected by the Spaniards, and some Frenchmen settled in it. But the new colony being neglected by the ministry, and Philip II. of Spain having accustomed himself to think that he was the sole proprietor of America, fitted out a fleet at Cadiz to destroy them. His orders were executed with barbarity. The French intrenchments were forced, and most of the people killed. The prisoners were hanged on trees; with this inscription, \"Not as Frenchmen, but as Heretics.\"\n\nThis cruelty was soon after revenged by Dominie de Gourgues, a skilful and intrepid seaman of Gascony, an enemy to the Spaniards, and passionately fond of hazardous expeditions and of glory. He held his estate; built some ships; and with a select band of adventurers like himself embarked for Florida. He drove the Spaniards from all their posts with incredible valour and activity; defeated them in every encounter; and by way of retaliation, hung the prisoners on trees, with this inscription, \"Not as Spaniards, but as Assassins.\" This expedition was attended with no other consequences; Gourgues blew up the forts he had taken, and returned home, where no notice was taken of him. It was conquered in 1539 by the Spaniards under Ferdinand de Soto, not without a great deal of bloodshed; as the natives were very warlike and made a vigorous resistance. The settlement, however, was not fully established till the year 1565; when the town of St Augustine, the capital of the colony while it remained in the hands of the Spaniards, was founded. In 1586, this place was taken and pillaged by Sir Francis Drake. It met with the same fate in 1665, being taken and plundered by Captain Davis and a body of buccaneers. In 1702, an attempt was made upon it by Colonel More, governor of Carolina. He set out with 500 English and 700 Indians; and having reached St Augustine, he besieged it for three months; at the expiration of which, the Spaniards having sent some ships to the relief of the place, he was obliged to retire. In 1740 another attempt was made by General Oglethorpe; but he being outwitted by the Spanish governor, was forced to raise the siege with loss; and Florida continued in the hands of the Spaniards till the year 1763, when it was ceded by treaty to Great Britain. During the American war, which terminated in 1783, it was again reduced by his Catholic majesty, and was guaranteed to the crown of Spain at the peace.","sp":310,"ep":312},{"h":"FLORILEGE","t":"is also particularly used for a kind of breviary, in the Eastern church, compiled by Arcadius, for the conveniency of the Greek priests and monks, who cannot carry with them, in their travels and pilgrimages, all the volumes wherein their office is dispersed.

The finest flour is most liable to breed these, especially when stale or ill prepared. In this case, if it be examined in a good light, it will be observed to be in continual motion, and on a nicer inspection there will be found in it a great number of little animals of the colour of the flour, and very nimble. If a little of this flour is laid on the plate of the double microscope, the insects are very distinctly seen in great numbers, very brisk and lively, continually crawling over one another's backs, and playing a thousand antic tricks together; whether in diversion, or in search of food, is not easy to be determined. These animals are of an oblong and slender form; their heads are furnished with a kind of trunk or hollow tube, by means of which they take in their food, and their body is composed of several rings. They do vast mischief among magazines of flour laid up for armies and other public uses. When they have once taken possession of a parcel of this valuable commodity, it is impossible to drive them out; and they increase so fast, that the only method of preventing the total loss of the parcel is to make it up into bread as soon as can be done. The way to prevent their breeding in the flour, is to preserve it from damp: nothing gets more injury by being put up damp than flour; and yet nothing is more frequently put up so. It should be always carefully and thoroughly dried before it is put up, and the barrels also dried into which it is to be put; then, if they are placed in a room tolerably warm and dry, they will keep it well.

See the article Colour (of Plants).\n\nColours extracted from Flowers. See Colour-Making.\n\nPreserving of Flowers. The method of preserving flowers in their natural beauty through the whole year has been much sought after by many people. Some have attempted it by gathering them when dry and not too much opened, and burying them in dry sand; but this, though it preserves their figure well, takes off from the liveliness of their colour. Muntingius prefers the following method to all others. Gather roses, or other flowers, when they are not yet thoroughly open, in the middle of a dry day; fill the vessel up to the top with them; and when full sprinkle them over with some good French wine, with a little salt in it; then set them by in a cellar, tying down the mouth of the pot. After this they may be taken out at pleasure; and, on setting them in the sun, or within reach of the fire, they will open as if growing naturally; and not only the colour, but the smell also will be preserved.\n\nThe flowers of plants are by much the most difficult parts of them to preserve in any tolerable degree of perfection; of which we have instances in all the collections of dried plants, or horti seci. In these the leaves, stalks, roots, and seeds of the plants, appear very well preserved; the strong texture of these parts making them always retain their natural form, and the colours in many species naturally remaining. But where these fade, the plant is little the worse for us as to the knowing the species by it. But it is very much otherwise in regard to flowers; these are naturally by much the most beautiful parts of the plants to which they belong; but they are so much injured in the common way of drying, that they not only lose, but change their colours one into another, by which means they give a handle to many errors; and they usually also wither up, so as to lose their very form and natural shape. The primrose and cowslip kinds are very eminent instances of the change of colours in the flowers of dried specimens; for those of these clasps plants easily dry in their natural shape; but they lose their yellow, and, instead of it, acquire a fine green colour, much superior to that of the leaves in their most perfect state. The flowers of all the violet kind lose their beautiful blue, and become of a dead white: so that in dried specimens there is no difference between the blue-flowered violet and the white-flowered kinds.\n\nSir Robert Southwell has communicated to the world a method of drying plants, by which this defect is proposed to be in a great measure remedied, and all flowers preserved in their natural shape, and many in their natural colours.\u2014For this purpose two plates of iron are to be prepared of the size of a large half sheet of paper, or larger, for particular occasions; these plates must be made so thick as not to be apt to bend; and there must be a hole made near every corner for the receiving a screw to fasten them close together. When these plates are prepared, lay in readiness several sheets of paper, and then gather the plants with their flowers when they are quite perfect. Let this be always done in the middle of a dry day; and then lay the plant and its flower on one of the sheets of paper doubled in half, spreading out all the leaves and petals as nicely as possible. If the stalk is thick, it must be pared or cut in half, so that it may lie flat; and if it is woody, it may be peeled, and only the bark left. When the plant is thus expanded, lay round about it some loose leaves and petals of the flower, which may serve to complete any part that is deficient. When all is thus prepared, lay several sheets of paper over the plant, and as many under it; then put the whole between the iron plates, laying the papers smoothly on one, and laying the other evenly over them; screw them close, and put them into an oven after the bread is drawn, and let them lie there two hours. After that, make a mixture of equal parts of aquafortis and common brandy; shake these well together, and when the flowers are taken out of the prejudice of the plates, rub them lightly over with a camel's hair pencil dipped in this liquor; then lay them upon fresh brown paper, and covering them with some other sheets, press them between this and other papers with a handkerchief till the\nFlower, the wet of these liquors is dried wholly away. When Flowering, the plant is thus far prepared, take the bulk of a nutmeg of gum dragon; put this into a pint of fair water cold, and let it stand 24 hours; it will in this time be wholly dissolved; then dip a fine hair pencil in this liquor, and with it daub over the back sides of the leaves, and lay them carefully down on half a sheet of white paper fairly expanded, and press them down with some more papers over them. When the gum-water is fixed, let the presser and papers be removed, and the whole work is finished. The leaves retain their verdure in this case, and the flowers usually keep their natural colours. Some care, however, must be taken, that the heat of the oven be not too great. When the flowers are thick and bulky, some art may be used to pare off their backs, and dispose the petals in a due order; and after this, if any of them are wanting, their places may be supplied with some of the superfluous ones dried on purpose; and if any of them are only faded, it will be prudent to take them away, and lay down others in their stead: the leaves may be also disposed and mended in the same manner.\n\nAnother method of preserving both flowers and fruit found throughout the whole year is also given by the same author. Take saltpetre, one pound; Armenian bole, two pounds; clean common sand, three pounds; mix all well together. Then gather fruit of any kind that is not fully ripe, with the stalk to each; put these in, one by one, into a wide-mouthed glass, laying them in good order. Tie over the top with an oil-cloth, and carry them into a dry cellar, and set the whole upon a bed of the prepared matter of four inches thick in a box. Fill up the remainder of the box with the same preparation; and let it be four inches thick all over the top of the glass, and all round its sides. Flowers are to be preserved in the same sort of glasses, and in the same manner; and they may be taken up after a whole year as plump and fair as when they were buried.\n\nArtificial Flowers of the Chinese.

These plants will grow and flower in water alone, without any earth, and make a very elegant appearance. We daily see this practised in single roots; but there is a method of doing it with several roots in the same vessel. Take a common small garden pot; stop the hole at the bottom with a cork, and late in the cork with putty, that no water can get through; then fit a board to the top of the pot, and bore five or seven holes in it at equal distances, to place the bulbs in; and as many smaller ones near them to receive sticks, which will serve to tie up the flowers. Then fill up the pot with water to the board; and place tulips, jonquils, narcissuses, and the like plants in the root upon the holes, so that the bottom of the roots may touch the water; thus will they all flower early in the season, and be much more beautiful than any pot of gathered flowers, and will last many weeks in their full perfection. After the season of flowering is over, the roots will gradually shrink through the holes of the board, and get loose into the water; but, instead of being spoiled there, they will soon increase in size; so that they cannot return through the holes, and will produce several offsets. It is natural to try from this the consequence of keeping the roots under water during the whole time of their blowing; and in this way they have been found to succeed very well, and flower even stronger and more beautifully than when in the ground. They may thus, also, with proper care in the degree of heat in the room, he kept flowering from before Christmas till March or April. It is not easy, in this last manner, to manage the keeping the boards under water, for which reason, it is better to procure some sheet-lead of about four pounds to the foot, and cut this to the size of the mouth of the pot. In this there should be bored holes for the bulbs, and other holes for the sticks; and, in order to keep the sticks quite firm, it is proper to have another plate of lead shaped to the bottom of the pot, with holes in it, answering to those of the upper plate made for the sticks. The sticks will by this means be always kept perfectly steady; and the roots, being kept under water by the upper plate of lead, will flower in the most vigorous and beautiful manner imaginable. Some have thought of adding to the virtues of the water by putting in nitre in small quantities, and others have added earth and sand at the bottom; but it has always been found to succeed better without any addition.\n\nIt may be more agreeable to some to use glass jars in this last method with the leads, instead of earthen pots. The bulbs succeed just as well in these; and there is this advantage, that the progress of the roots is seen all the while, and they are managed better as to the supply of water.\n\nBy repeated experiments in this way on dried bulbs, and on those taken fresh out of the ground, the former have been found to succeed the best. For those taken fresh out of the ground being full of moisture, will not soon, upon changing their element, be nourished fully by a new one; and the fibres which they had struck in the ground, always rot when put into the water, and new ones must be formed in their places; so that it requires more time for them to come to flowering. The bulbs themselves will not rot in this manner; but they will never be so strong as those which were put into the water dry, which gradually fill themselves with moisture from it, and regularly plump up. The best method of managing the whole process is this: Place the bulbs at first only on the surface of the water; for thus they will strike out their fibres most strongly. When they have stood thus six weeks, pour in the water so high as to cover them entirely, and keep them thus till they have done flowering.\n\nSometimes the roots will become mouldy in several parts while they stand above the water, and the cleaning them of it is no purpose; for it will eat and spread the farther, and frequently eat through two or three of their coats. In this case they must be immediately covered with water; when the mould will be stopped,\nFlowering stopped, and the roots become found, and flower as well as those which never had any such distemper. If the roots are suffered to remain in water all the year, they will not decay; but will flower again at their proper season, and that as vigorously as those which have been taken out and dried. The old fibres of those roots never rot till they are ready to push forth new ones. It is found by experience, that the hyacinth, and many other plants, grow to a greater degree of perfection when thus in water than when in the ground. There is a peculiar species of hyacinth called Keyser's jewel; this never, or very rarely, produces seed-vessels in the common way of flowering in the ground; but it will often produce some pods when blown in water.\n\nMr Millar has intimated, in the Philosophical Transactions, that bulbs set in glasses grow weaker, and should be renewed every other year; but it is found, that, when managed in this manner, and kept under water, at the time of taking them up, they are as large, and some of them larger, than when planted; and if these be dried at a proper season, they will flower, year after year, as well as fresh ones.\n\nRanunculus and anemone roots have been found to shoot up their stalks very well in this way; but the flowers are usually blasted, which seems to arise from want of free air. Pinks will flower very well in this manner; auriculas also may, with care, be brought to flower, but not strongly. Roses, jessamines, and honeysuckles, may also be made to flower this way, and will thrive and send out suckers; the best pieces to plant, are suckers cut off about three inches under ground, without any fibres. The succulent plants may also be raised this way; for instance, the opuntia or Indian fig. If a fragment of a leaf of this plant be cut, and laid by to dry for a month till it is an absolute skin, as soon as it is put in this manner into water, it begins to plump up, and soon sends out fibrous roots, and produces new leaves as quickly as it would do in the ground.\n\nThis is the more singular in these sorts of plants, because in their natural state in the ground, they cannot bear much water. This method of growing in water is not peculiar to the bulbous-rooted ones, but others may even be raised from feed by it. A bean or pea, let in this manner, will grow up to its proper standard, and will flower and produce pods which will ripen their seed. The smaller seeds may be also raised in this manner, by the help of wool to support them.\n\nNo vegetable transplanted out of the earth into water will thrive kindly; but any plant, whether raised from the root or feed in water, may be transplanted to the earth, and will succeed very well. It may be possible, therefore, from this method of raising plants in water, to come at a better way than is usually practised of raising some roots in the earth which are subject to rot there; such as anemones, ranunculuses, and hyacinths. A bulb dropped by chance upon the ground, will strike out both stronger and more numerous fibres than those which are planted in the usual way in the ground. On this principle, it may be proper to take out the earth of the bed where the bulbs are to stand at the time of planting them, to such a depth as they are to be placed under it when set for flowering. The bulbs are then to be set in their places, on the surface of this low ground; and to stand there till they have shot out their fibres and their head; then the earth is to be added over them by degrees, till they are covered as high above the head as they are in the usual manner of planting them; thus they would be preserved from the danger of rotting; and their fibres would be much stronger, and consequently they would draw more nourishment, and flower better, than in the common way. The common method of planting these roots renders them liable to be destroyed by either extreme of a wet or a dry season. In the first case, they immediately rot by the abundant moisture they receive; and, in the second, they become dry as a stick and mouldy, so that they are infallibly rotted by the first rain that falls afterwards.\n\nThe directions necessary to the success of the bulbs planted in water are these. When the leaden false bottoms are fixed down tight within two or three inches of the bottom of the vessel (which is only designed to hold the sticks steady which are to support the leaves and stalks), then lay on the lead upon which the bulbs are to rest, placing the notched part opposite to that in the false bottom, as near as the sticks, when placed, will suffer it; then place the bulbs one in each hole, and fill up with water to the upper lead. The bottom of the bulb will then touch the water; and as the water diminishes in quantity, keep it supplied with more up to the same height for a month or six weeks; in which time the bulbs will have shot strong fibres. Then fill up the water about half an inch above the surface of the lead; and, by degrees, as the fibres strengthen, and the plume floats from the head, keep the water higher and higher, till at length the whole bulb is covered. The water is to be kept at this standard till the season for drying them returns.\u2014At the time of planting the bulbs, they must be carefully cleaned from any foulnesses at the bottom, by scraping them with the point of a knife till the sound part of the bulb appears; clear them likewise from any loose skins, and even take off their brown skin till they appear white; otherwise this brown skin will tinge the water, and the growth will not succeed so well.\n\nThe notches in the side of each lead are intended to give easy passage to the water, that, if there should be any foulness or sediment in it, on shaking it a little it may all run through, and fresh water be put in its place. But this shifting the water need not be done more than once or twice in a winter, as there may be occasion from the foulness; and when this is done, the sides of the vessel should be cleaned with a painter's brush, and rinsed out again, and the bulbs themselves washed, by pouring water on them at a little distance.\n\nAt any time when the outer skins of the bulbs dry, they are to be peeled off, that they may not occasion foulness in the water; and if any dust or foul matter be at any time observed swimming on the surface, the method is to fill up the pot or vessel to the rim, and let it run over: this will carry off that light foulness, and the water may afterwards be poured away to the proper standard.\n\nBulbs of equal sizes should be planted together in the\nthe same pot, that they may all have the same benefit of the water. Narcissuses and hyacinths do well together; as also tulips and jonquils, and crocuses and snowdrops.","sp":313,"ep":317},{"h":"FLUDD","t":"ROBERT, a philosopher and physician of some celebrity in his time, was the son of Sir Thomas Fludd, treasurer of war to Queen Elizabeth; and was born at Milgate in Kent, in the year 1574.

On his return home, he took the degree of M.D., settled in the city of London, and was chosen a fellow of the college of physicians. His piety was of an enthusiastic nature, and the seeming depth of his knowledge procured him much admiration, and gave him a temporary fame. It is said that he employed a kind of unintelligible cant when speaking to his patients, which sometimes contributed to their recovery, as it operated on their faith. He is chiefly known as a sectary in philosophy, and not as a physician. He bleeded the incomprehensible reveries of the Cabalists and Paracelsians, forming a new physical system replete with mystery and absurdity. He believed in two universal principles, the northern or condemning, and the southern or rarefying power. Innumerable geniuses he conceived to preside over these, and committed the charge of diseases to legions of spirits collected from the four winds of heaven. In his estimation, a harmony subsisted between the macrocosm and the microcosm, or the world of nature and of man. All his fancies and whims it is impossible to enumerate, yet they attracted the notice of the philosophers of that age, being supported by mysterious gravity and the shadow of erudition. Even Kepler himself thought his extravagant jargon worthy of refutation, and Gassendi for this purpose wrote his Examen Philosophiae Fluddiana.

Of many remarkable kinds of these, a description is given under the article Animalcule. All of these little creatures are easily destroyed by separating them from their natural element. Naturalists have even fallen upon shorter methods. A needle point, dipped in spirit of vitriol, and then immersed into a drop of pepper water, readily kills all the animalcules; which, though before frisking about with great liveliness and activity, no sooner come within the influence of the acid particles, than they spread themselves, and tumble down to all appearance dead. The like may be done by a solution of salt; only with this difference, that, by the latter application, they seem to grow vertiginous, turning round and round till they fall down. Tincture of tartar, used in the same manner, kills them still more readily; yet not so, but there will be apparent marks of their first being sick and convulsed. Inks destroy them as fast as spirit of vitriol, and human blood produces the same effect. Urine, lack, and sugar, all destroy them, though not so fast; besides, that there is some diversity in their figures and appearances, as they receive their deaths from this poison or that. The point of a pin dipped in spittle, presently killed all the kinds of animalcules in puddle water, as Mr Harris supposes it will other animalcules of this kind.\n\nAll who are acquainted with microscopic observations, know very well, that in water, in which the best glasses can discover no particle of animated matter, after a few grains of pepper, or a fragment of a plant of almost any kind, has been some time in it, animals full of life and motion are produced; and those in such numbers, as to equal the fluid itself in quantity.\u2014When we see a numerous brood of young fishes in a pond, we make no doubt of their having owed their origin to the spawn, that is, to the eggs of the parents of the same species. What are we then to think of these? If we will consider the progress of nature in the insect tribes in general, and especially in such of them as are most analogous to these, we shall find it less difficult to give an account of their origin than might have been imagined.\n\nA small quantity of water taken from any ditch in the summer months, is found to be full of little worms, seeming in nothing so much as in size to differ from the microscopic animalcules. Nay, water, without these, exposed in open vessels to the heat of the weather, will be always found to abound with multitudes of them, visible to the naked eye, and full of life and motion. These we know, by their future changes, are the fly worms of the different species of gnats, and multitudes of other fly species; and we can easily determine, that they have owed their origin only to the eggs of the parent fly there deposited. Nay, a closer observation will at any time give ocular proof of this; as the flies may be seen laying their eggs there, and the eggs may be followed through all their changes to the fly again. Why then are we to doubt but that the air abounds with other flies and animalcules as minute as the worms in those fluids; and that these last are only the fly worms of the former, which after a proper time spent in that state, will suffer changes like those of the larger kinds, and become flies like those to whose eggs they owed their origin? Vid. Reaumur, Hist. Insect., vol. iv. p. 431.\n\nThe differently medicated liquors made by infusions of different plants, afford a proper matter for the worms of different species of these small flies: and there is no reason to doubt, but that among these some are viviparous, others oviparous; and to this may be, in a great measure owing the different time taken up for the production of these insects in different fluids. Those which are a proper matter for the worms of the viviparous fly, may be soonest found full of them; as, probably the liquor is no sooner in a state to afford them.\nthem proper nourishment, than their parents place them there; whereas those produced from the eggs of the little oviparous flies, must, after the liquor is in a proper state, and they are deposited in it in the form of eggs, have a proper time to be hatched, before they can appear alive.\n\nIt is easy to prove, that the animals we find in these vegetable infusions were brought thither from elsewhere. It is not less easy to prove, that they could not be in the matter infused any more than in the water in which it is infused.\n\nNotwithstanding the fabulous accounts of salamanders, it is now well known, that no animal, large or small, can bear the force of fire for any considerable time; and, by parity of reason, we are not to believe, that any insect, or embryo insect, in any state, can bear the heat of boiling water for many minutes. To proceed to inquiries on this foundation: If several tubes filled with water, with a small quantity of vegetable matter, such as pepper, oak bark, truffles, &c., in which, after a time, insects will be discovered by the microscope; and other like tubes be filled with simple water boiled, with water and pepper boiled together, and with water with the two other ingredients all separately boiled in it; when all these liquors come to a proper time for the observation of the microscope, all, as well those which have been boiled as those which have not, will be found equally to abound with insects, and those of the same kind, in infusions of the same kind, whether boiled or not boiled. Those in the infusions which had sustained a heat capable of destroying animal life, must therefore not have subsisted either in the water or in the matters put into it, but must have been brought thither after the boiling; and it seems by no way so probably, as by means of some little winged inhabitants of the air depositing their eggs or worms in these fluids.\n\nOn this it is natural to ask, how it comes to pass, that while we see myriads of the progeny of these winged insects in water, we never see themselves? The answer is equally easy, viz. because we can always place a drop of this water immediately before the focus of the microscope, and keep it there while we are at leisure to examine its contents; but that is not the case with regard to the air inhabited by the parent flies of these worms, which is an immense extent in proportion to the water proper for nourishing these worms; and consequently, while the latter are clustered together in heaps, the former may be dispersed and scattered. Nor do we want instances of this, even in insects of a larger kind. In many of our gardens, we frequently find vessels of water filled with worms of the gnat kind, as plentifully, in proportion to their size, as those of other fluids are with animalcules. Every cubic inch of water in these vessels contains many hundreds of animals; yet we see many cubic inches of air in the garden not affording one of the parent flies.\n\nBut neither are we positively to declare that the parent flies of these animalcules are in all states wholly invisible to us; if not singly to be seen, there are some strong reasons to imagine that they may in great clusters. Every one has seen in a clear day, when looking steadfastly at the sky, that the air is in many places disturbed by motions and convolutions in certain spots.\n\nThese cannot be the effects of imagination, or of faults in our eyes, because they appear the same to all; and if we consider what would be the case to an eye formed in such a manner as to see nothing smaller than an ox, on viewing the air on a marsh fully peopled with gnats, we must be sensible that the clouds of these insects, though to us distinctly enough visible, would appear to such an eye merely as the moving parcels of air in the former instance do to us; and surely it is hence no rash conclusion to infer, that the case may be the same, and that myriads of flying insects, too small to be singly the objects of our view, yet are to us what the clouds of gnats would be in the former case.\n\nNervous Fluid.

This opinion is supported by the solution of salts, and the formation of tinctures. If a small bit of saffron is thrown into a phial full of water, a yellow tincture will soon be communicated to the water to a considerable height, though the phial is allowed to remain at rest; which indicates a motion in those parts of the fluid which touch the saffron, by which its colouring matter is carried up.\n\nWith regard to water, this can scarce be denied; the constant exhalations from its surface show, that there must be a perpetual motion in its parts from the ascent of the steam through it. In mercury, where sensible evaporation does not take place, it might be doubted; and accordingly the Newtonian philosophers in general have been of opinion, that there are some substances essentially fluid, from the spherical figure of their constituent particles. The congelation of mercury, however, by an extreme degree of cold, demonstrates that fluidity is not essentially inherent in mercury more than in other bodies.\n\nThat fluids have vacuities in their substance is evident, because they may be made to dissolve certain bodies without sensibly increasing their bulk. For example, water will dissolve a certain quantity of salt; after which it will receive a little sugar, and after that a little alum, without increasing its first dimensions. Here we can scarcely suppose anything else than that the saline particles were interposed between those of the fluid; and as, by the mixture of salt and water, a considerable degree of cold is produced, we may thence easily see why the fluid receives these substances without any increase of bulk. All substances are expanded by heat, and reduced into less dimensions by cold; therefore, if any substance is added to a fluid, which tends to make it cold, the expansion by the bulk of the substance added will not be so much perceived as if this effect had not happened; and if the quantity added be small, the fluid will contract as much, perhaps more, from the cold produced by the mixture, than it will be expanded from the bulk of the salt. This also may let us know with what these interfaces between the particles of the fluid were filled up; namely, the element of fire or heat. The saline particles, up\nFluor Worm.

It is played on by blowing it with the mouth; and the tones or notes are changed by stopping and opening the holes disposed for that purpose along its side.\n\nThis is a very ancient instrument. It was at first called the flute \u00e0 bec, from bec an old Gaulish word signifying the beak of a bird or fowl, but more especially of a cock; the term flute \u00e0 bec must therefore signify the beaked flute; which appears very proper, on comparing it with the traverso or German flute. The word flute is derived from fluita, the Latin for a lamprey or small eel taken in the Sicilian seas, having seven holes immediately below the gills on each side, the precise number of those in the front of the flute.\n\nBy Merlemus this instrument is called the fistula dulcis, seu Anglicus; the lowest note, according to him, for the treble flute, is C fa ut, and the compass of the instrument 15 notes. There is, however, a flute known by the name of the concert flute, the lowest note of which is F. Indeed, ever since the introduction of the flute into concerts, the lowest note of the instrument, of what size ever it is, has been called F; when in truth its pitch is determinable only by its correspondence in respect of acuteness or gravity with one or other of the chords in the scala maxima or great system.\n\nBesides the true concert flute, others of a less size were soon introduced into concerts of violins; in which case the method was to write the flute part in a key correspondent.\ncorrespondent to its pitch. This practice was introduced in 1710 by one Woodcock, a celebrated performer on this instrument, and William Babell organist of the church of All-hallows, Bread Street, London. They failed, however, in procuring for the flute a reception into concerts of various instruments; for which reason, one Thomas Stanely, a very curious maker of flutes and other instruments of the like kind, about the year 1732, adverting to the scale of Mercennius, in which the lowest note was C, invented what he called the new system; in which, by making the flute of such a size as to be a fifth above concert pitch, the lowest note became C, sol, fa ut. By this contrivance the necessity of transposing the flute part was taken away; for a flute of this size, adjusted to the system above mentioned, became an octave to the violin. To further this invention of Stanely's, one Lewis Merci, an excellent performer on the flute, published, about the year 1735, six folios for this instrument, three of which are said to be accommodated to Mr. Stanely's new system; but the German flute was now become a favourite instrument, and Stanely's ingenuity failed of its effect.\n\nOne great objection indeed lies against this instrument, which, however, equally affects all perforated pipes; namely, that they are never perfectly in tune, or cannot be made to play all their notes with equal exactness. The utmost that the makers of them can do is to tune them to some one key; as the hautboy to C, the German flute to D, and the English flute to F; and to effect this truly, is a matter of no small difficulty. The English flutes made by the younger Stanely came nearest of any to perfection; but those of Breslau, though excellent in their tone, are all too flat in the upper octave. For these reasons some are induced to think, that the utmost degree of proficiency on any of those instruments is not worth the labour of attaining it.\n\nGerman Flute, is an instrument entirely different from the common flute. It is not, like that, put into the mouth to be played; but the end is flopped with a stopper or plug, and the lower lip is applied to a hole about two inches and a half or three inches distant from the end. This instrument is usually about a foot and a half long; rather bigger at the upper end than the lower; and perforated with holes, besides that for the mouth, the lowest of which is stopped and opened by the little finger's pressing on a brass or sometimes a silver key, like those in hautboys, bassoons, &c. Its sound is exceeding sweet and agreeable; and serves as a treble in a concert.\n\nFlute, or Flutti, is a kind of long vessel, with flat ribs or floor timbers, round behind, and swollen in the middle; serving chiefly for the carrying of provisions in fleets or squadrons of ships; though it is often used in merchandise. The word flute taken for a sort of boat or vessel, is derived, according to Borel, from the ancient flotte, a little boat. In the verbal process of the miracles of St. Catharine of Sweden, in the 12th century, we read Unus equum suum una cum mercibus magni ponderis introduxit super infrumentum de lignis fabricatum, vulgariter dictum flotta.

They are supposed to have been first introduced in imitation of the plaiting of women's robes; and are therefore called by the Latins fringes and rugae. The French call them cannelures, as being excavations; and we, flutes or flutings, as bearing some resemblance to the musical instrument so called. They are chiefly affected in the Ionic order, in which they had their first rise; though they are also used in all the richer orders, as the Corinthian and Composite; but rarely in the Doric, and scarcely ever in the Tuscan.","sp":318,"ep":320},{"h":"FLUX","t":"in Medicine, an extraordinary inflame or evacuation of some humour.

There is also a kind of rest or cessation of about half an hour between the flux and reflux; during which time the water is at its greatest height, called high-water. The flux is made by the motion of the water of the sea from the equator towards the poles; which, in its progress, striking against the coasts in its way, and meeting with opposition from them, swells, and where it can find passage, as in flats, rivers, &c., rises up and runs into the land. This motion follows, in some measure, the course of the moon; as it loses or comes later every day by about three quarters of an hour, or more precisely by 48 minutes; and by so much is the motion of the moon slower than that of the sun. It is always highest and greatest in full moons, particularly those of the equinoxes. In some parts, as at Mount St Michael, it rises 80 or 90 feet, though in the open sea it never rises above a foot or two; and in some places, as about the Morea, there is no flux at all.

For instance, an ore, or other matter, is said to be in a liquid flux, when it is completely fused.\n\nBut the word flux is generally used to signify certain saline matters, which facilitate the fusion of ores, and other matters which are difficultly fusible in effays and reductions of ores; such are alkalies, nitre, borax, tartar, and common salt. But the word flux is more particularly applied to mixtures of different proportions of only nitre and tartar; and these fluxes are called by particular names, according to the proportions of these ingredients, as in the following articles.\n\nWhite Flux, is made with equal parts of nitre and of tartar detonated together, by which they are alkalinized.\nThe residuum of this detonation is an alkali composed of the alkalies of the nitre and of the tartar, both which are absolutely of the same nature. As the proportion of nitre in this mixture is more than is sufficient to consume entirely all the inflammable matter of the tartar, the alkali remaining after the detonation is perfectly white, and is therefore called white flux; and as this alkali is made very quickly, it is also called extemporaneous alkali. When a small quantity only of white flux is made, as a few ounces for instance, some nitre always remains undecomposed, and a little of the inflammable principle of the tartar, which gives a red or even a black colour to some part of the flux; but this does not happen when a large quantity of white flux is made; because then the heat is much greater. This small quantity of undecomposed nitre and tartar which remains in white flux is not hurtful in most of the metallic fusions in which this flux is employed; but if the flux be required perfectly pure, it might easily be disengaged from those extraneous matters by a long and strong calcination, without fusion.\n\nCrude Flux. By crude flux is meant the mixture of nitre and tartar in any proportions, without detonation. Thus the mixture of equal parts of the two salts used in the preparation of the white flux, or the mixture of one part of nitre and two parts of tartar for the preparation of the black flux, are each of them a crude flux before detonation. It has also been called white flux, from its colour; but this might occasion it to be confounded with the white flux above described. The name, therefore, of crude flux is more convenient.\n\nCrude flux is detonated and alkalinized during the reductions and fusions in which it is employed; and is then changed into white or black flux, according to the proportions of which it is composed. This detonation produces good effects in these fusions and reductions, if the swelling and extravasation of the detonating matters be guarded against. Accordingly, crude flux may be employed successfully in many operations; as, for instance, in the ordinary operation for procuring the regulus of antimony.\n\nBlack Flux. Black flux is produced from the mixture of two parts of tartar and one part of nitre detonated together. As the quantity of nitre which enters into the composition of this flux is not sufficient to consume all the inflammable matters of the tartar, the alkali which remains after the detonation contains much black matter, of the nature of coal, and is therefore called black flux.","sp":320,"ep":321},{"h":"FLUXIONS","t":"INTRODUCTION.\n\nThe branch of mathematical analysis which is called in this country the Method of Fluxions, but on the continent the Differential and Integral Calculi, was invented near the end of the 17th century; and Sir Isaac Newton, and Mr Leibnitz, two of the greatest philosophers of that age, have both claimed the discovery.\n\nIt will appear very possible that two such men should both fall upon this method of calculation nearly about the same time, if it be considered, that from the beginning of the 17th century its principles were gradually coming into view, in consequence of the united labours and discoveries of a number of mathematicians, such as Napier, Cavalieri, Roberval, Fermat, Barrow, Wallis, and others. And considering the number of men of the first abilities engaged at that time in the study of mathematics, we may reasonably suppose, that the fluxional, or differential calculus would very soon have been found according to the ordinary progress of human knowledge, even although a Newton, or a Leibnitz, had not by the force of superior genius anticipated perhaps by a few years that event. The first intimation that was given of the discovery of the calculus was in the year 1669, when, through the intervention of Dr Barrow, a correspondence was begun between Sir Isaac Newton (then Mr Newton), and Mr Collins, one of the secretaries to the Royal Society. Dr Barrow communicated to the latter a paper by Newton, which had for its title, De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas. In this paper, besides shewing how to resolve equations by approximation, Newton teaches how to square curves, not only when the expression for the ordinate in terms of the abscissa is a rational quantity, but also when it involves radical quantities, by first resolving these into an infinite series of rational terms by means of the binomial theorem, a thing which had never before been done. Newton in this paper gives some rather obscure indications of the nature of his calculus, which however serve to show, beyond all doubt, that he was then in possession of it; and indeed there is good reason to believe that he knew it as early as the year 1665, or even sooner.\n\nThese analytical discoveries of Newton were immediately circulated among mathematicians both in this country and abroad, by Dr Barrow, and by Collins and Oldenburg, the two secretaries to the Royal Society.\n\nAbout the end of the year 1672, Newton communicated to Collins, by letter, a method of drawing tangents to curve lines, illustrated by an example, from which it again plainly appears, that he now possessed his method of fluxions.\n\nIn the course of the following year, Leibnitz came to London, and communicated to several members of the Royal Society, some researches relating to the theory of differences. It was however shown to him, that this subject had been previously treated by Mouton, an astronomer of Lyons; upon this Leibnitz directed his attention to the doctrine of series, which was now considerably advanced, in consequence of the discoveries of the English mathematicians.\n\nThe first direct communication that passed between Newton and Leibnitz, was by a letter, which the former addressed to Oldenburg, about the middle of the year 1676. In the beginning of this letter, which was intended to be shown to Leibnitz, Newton speaks of him with much respect. The letter itself chiefly refers to\nthe theory of infinite series. In a second letter, written also with a view to its being communicated to Leibnitz, Newton, after following deserved commendation on him, proceeds to explain the steps by which he was led to the discovery of the binomial theorem. He afterwards, among other things, delivers several theorems which have the method of fluxions for their basis; but he does not give their demonstrations, and only observes, that they depend on the solution of a general problem, the enunciation of which he conceals under an anagram of transposed letters, but the meaning of it is this: An equation being given containing any number of flowing quantities, to find their fluxions; and the contrary. This letter affords another proof that Newton was now in full possession of his calculus.\n\nIn the end of June 1677, Leibnitz sent to Oldenburg, for the purpose of being communicated to Newton, a letter containing the first effays of his Differential Calculus. The death of Oldenburg, which happened soon after, put an end to the correspondence, and in the year 1684, Leibnitz published his method, in the Leipzig Acts for the month of October 1684. The title of the memoir which contained it was, Nova methodus pro maximis et minimis, itemque tangentibus, quee nec fractas, nec irrationalis quantitates moratur, et singulare pro illis calculi genus. Thus, in whatever way Leibnitz came by his calculus, whether he discovered it solely by the force of his own genius, or founded it on the method of fluxions, previously invented by Newton, both of which hypotheses are possible, his method was certainly published before Newton's, which, except what transpired in consequence of the circulation of his letters and manuscripts, became only known to the world in general for the first time, by the publication of the Principia in the end of the year 1686.\n\nIt seems at first to have been allowed, that Leibnitz had invented his calculus, without having any previous knowledge of what had been done by Newton; for in the first edition of the Principia, Newton says, \"In the course of a correspondence which ten years ago I carried on with the very learned geometrician Mr Leibnitz, having intimated to him that I possessed a method of determining maxima and minima, of drawing tangents, and resolving such problems, not only when the equations were rational, but also when they were irrational; and having concealed this method, by transposing the letters of the following sentence\u2014An equation being given, containing any number of flowing quantities, to find their fluxions; and the contrary; this celebrated man answered that he had found a similar method, which he communicated to me, and which differs from mine, only in the enunciation, and in the notation.\" To this, in the edition of 1714 is added, \"and in the manner of conceiving the quantities to be generated.\"\n\nThere is reason to suppose that Leibnitz might have continued to enjoy undisturbed the honour of being considered as one of the inventors of the fluxional, or differential calculus, if he had not manifested a disposition to attribute the invention too exclusively to himself. This called forth some remarks respecting the priority of Newton's claim to the discovery. In particular M. Facio asserted, in a treatise on the Line of swiftest descent, published in 1699, \"that he was obliged to own Newton as the first inventor of the differential calculus, and the first by many years; and that he left the world to judge whether Leibnitz, the second inventor, had taken anything from him.\"\n\nOn the other hand, when Newton's treatise on the quadrature of curves, and on the enumeration of lines of the third order was published, which was in 1704, the Leipzig journalists infamated, in a very illiberal account which they gave of the work, that Leibnitz was the first inventor, and that Newton had taken his method from Leibnitz's, substituting fluxions for differences.\n\nIn consequence of this attack on Newton, Dr John Keill asserted, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1708, that Newton was beyond a doubt the first inventor of the arithmetic of fluxions, and that the same arithmetic, having its name and notation changed, was afterwards published by Mr Leibnitz in the Leipzig Acts. In answer to this, Leibnitz replied, in a letter to Hans Sloane, secretary to the Royal Society, that no one knew better than Newton himself, that the charge against him implied in Keill's assertion was false; and he required Keill to retract what he had said. To this request however Keill would by no means accede; but on the contrary, he wrote a long letter to the secretary of the Royal Society, in which he endeavoured to prove, not only that Newton had preceded Leibnitz in the invention, but that he had given to the latter such indications of the nature of his calculus, as made it easy for him to fall upon the same. This letter was sent to Leibnitz, who replied, that Keill, although learned, was too young a man to be fit to judge of what had passed between him and Newton, and he requested the Royal Society to put a stop to Keill's clamours.\n\nThe Royal Society being thus appealed to as a judge, appointed a committee to examine all the old letters, papers, and documents, which had passed among the several mathematicians, relating to the question. The judgment of the committee was to the following effect. \"That Mr Leibnitz was in London in 1673, and went thence to Paris, where he kept a correspondence with Mr Collins, by means of Mr Oldenburg, till about September 1676, and then returned by London and Amsterdam, to Hanover; and that Mr Collins was very free in communicating to able mathematicians what he had received from Newton. That it did not appear, that Mr Leibnitz knew anything of the differential calculus before his letter of the 21st of June 1677, which was a year after a copy of Newton's letter of the 10th of December 1672 had been sent to Paris, to be communicated to him, and above four years after Mr Collins began to communicate that letter to his correspondents; in which letter, the method of fluxions was sufficiently described to any intelligent person. That Newton was in possession of his calculus before the year 1669, and that those who had reputed Leibnitz the first inventor, knew little or nothing of his correspondence with Mr Collins, and Mr Oldenburg, long before, nor of Newton's having that method above 15 years before Mr Leibnitz began to publish it in the Leipzig Acts. That for these reasons, they reckoned Newton the first inventor, and were of opinion, that Mr Keill in asserting the same had been in no ways injurious to Mr Leibnitz.\"\n\nIt is deserving of remark, that the committee delivered no opinion upon the advantage which Leibnitz was accused of having taken of the hints furnished to him,\nin the course of his correspondence with Newton; they left the decision of this point to the world in general; and to enable every one to judge for himself, the Royal Society ordered the opinion of the committee to be printed, together with all the documents upon which it was founded. These appeared in 1712 under the title of, *Commercium Epistolicum de Analytica promota*. This work was carefully circulated over Europe, to vindicate the title of the English nation to the discovery.\n\nThe *Commercium Epistolicum* having appeared, Leibnitz expressed great dissatisfaction, and threatened to reply in such a manner as to confound his adversaries. There seems no reason however to suppose, that anything he could have said, would have affected Newton's claim to the honour of being the first inventor; for on this point there cannot be any doubt. With respect, however, to the other question, whether Leibnitz took his calculus from Newton, or found it himself, it is impossible to decide with such certainty. Mr Montucla, in his History of Mathematics, says, \"There are only three places of the *Commercium Epistolicum*, which treat of the principles of fluxions in so clear a way, as to prove that Newton had found it before Leibnitz, but too obscurely, it seems, to take from the latter the merit of the discovery. One of these is in a letter from Newton to Oldenburg, who had signified to him, that Slusius and Gregory had each found a very simple method of drawing tangents. Newton replied, that he conjectured what the nature of that method was; and he gave an example of it, which shows it to be in effect the same thing as those geometricians had found. He adds, that it is only a particular case, or rather a corollary to a method much more general, which, without a laborious calculation, applies to the finding of tangents to all sorts of curves, geometrical or mechanical, and that without being obliged to free the equation from radicals. He repeats the same thing without explaining himself farther, in another letter, and he conceals the principle of the method under transposed letters. The only place where Newton has allowed any thing of his method to transpire, is in his *Analytis per equationes numero terminas infinitas*. He here discloses, in a very concise and obscure manner, his principle of fluxions, but there is no certainty of Leibnitz's having seen this essay. His opponents have never asserted that it was communicated to him by letter, and they have gone no farther than to suspect, that he had obtained a knowledge of it in the interview which he had with Collins, upon his second journey to London. Indeed, this suspicion is not entirely destitute of probability, for Leibnitz admitted, that in this interview, he saw a part of the *Epistolary Correspondence of Collins*. However I think it would be rash to pronounce upon this circumstance. If Leibnitz had confined himself to a few essays of his new calculus, there might have been some foundation for that suspicion; but the numerous pieces he inserted in the *Leipzic Acts*, prove the calculus to have received such improvements from him, that probably he owed the invention of it to his genius, and to the efforts he made to discover a method, which put Newton in possession of so many beautiful truths. This is so much the more likely, as, from the method of tangents discovered by Dr Barrow, the transition to the differential calculus was easy, nor was the step too great for such a genius as that with which Leibnitz appears to have been endowed.\" Such is the opinion of Montucla, who being a foreigner, cannot be supposed have been too partial towards Newton, an Englishman. The British mathematicians have hitherto, with few exceptions, entertained an opinion still more decidedly in favour of the claims of their celebrated countryman.\n\nIt has been said that Newton took no share in the controversy; this however seems not to have been exactly the case, for besides suppressing in the third edition of his *Principia* (printed in 1726) the passage we have already quoted, which seems to admit that Leibnitz invented his calculus for himself, he is known to have written the notes which accompany the edition of the *Commercium Epistolicum*, printed in 1722. Leibnitz had also begun to prepare a *Commercium Epistolicum*, but he died before it was completed.\n\nBesides the disputes that have happened reflecting the inventor of the method of fluxions, the accuracy of the method itself has been the subject of controversy, both in Britain and on the continent. The differential calculus was attacked abroad by Nieuwentijt, a writer of little or no reputation as a mathematician, and by Rolle, who was an expert algebraist, and an indefatigable calculator, but rash, and too confident of the justness of his own opinions, and jealous of the inventions of others. To the first of these writers Leibnitz himself replied, and afterwards Bernoulli and Herman; the attack from Rolle was successfully repelled by Varignon, who was as zealous and intelligent, as his adversary was warm and impetuous.\n\nThe very concise manner in which the great inventor of the method of fluxions thought proper to explain its principles, gave occasion to the celebrated Dr Berkeley bishop of Cloyne to call in question, not only the logical accuracy of the reasoning employed to establish the theory of fluxions, but also the faith of mathematicians in general, in regard to the truths of religion. The bishop commenced the controversy first in a small work entitled *The Minute Philosopher*; but his principal attack made its appearance in 1734, under the title of \"The Analyst, or A Discourse addressed to an Infidel Mathematician,\" (understood to be Dr Halle) \"wherein it is examined whether the objects, principles, and inferences of the modern Analyst are more distinctly conceived than religious mysteries and points of faith?\" One of the best answers which was made to this work came from the pen of Benjamin Robins, and is entitled, \"A discourse concerning the nature and certainty of Sir Isaac Newton's methods of fluxions, and of prime and ultimate ratios.\" Other mathematicians likewise attempted to defend Newton, and the method of fluxions, against the very cogent and well-directed arguments of the bishop; but the most satisfactory way of removing all objections to the method, was to abandon those obscure and inaccurate modes of expression, of which Berkeley had, not without some reason, complained, and to substitute in their place, others more intelligible, and more consonant to the common methods of mathematical reasoning. This was accordingly done by the celebrated MacLaurin, who, in the year 1742, published his *Treatise of Fluxions*, a work which, although in some respects rather diffuse, placed the principles of the method beyond controversy, by establishing them on the firm basis of geometrical demonstration.\n\nIt would extend this introduction to too great a length were we to enter into a detailed account of the various improvements which the calculus has received.\nfrom its first invention to the present time. We shall\nbriefly observe, that among those who contributed\nthe first and the most effectually to its improvement, we\nmay reckon Newton and Leibnitz themselves, the two\nillustrious rivals for the honour of its discovery; these\nwere followed by the two brothers James and John\nBernoulli, by the Marquis de L'Hopital, and many\nother foreign mathematicians; and in this country we\nmay reckon Craig, Cheyne, Cotes, Taylor, and De\nMoivre, as among the earliest of its improvers. It is to\nCotes in particular that we are indebted for the discovery\nof the method of finding the fluents of certain rational\nfractions, a discovery which was extended by De Moivre,\nso as to form one of the most beautiful and complete\nbranches of the theory of fluxions.\n\nBesides innumerable memoirs on particular branches\nof the fluxional calculus, which are to be found in acade-\nmical collections, many distinct treatises have been\nwritten on the subject. Some of the most valuable of\nthese are as follow. The Method of Fluxions and In-\nfinite Series, by Sir Isaac Newton. This work was\nwritten in Latin, but was not published till the year\n1736, when it was translated into English, and given to\nthe world, along with a comment, by Mr Colson. Har-\nmonia Mensurarum, by Cotes, a most valuable and ori-\nginal work, published in 1716. A Treatise on Fluxions,\nin two books, by Maclaurin, published in 1742. Many\nparts of the writings of the celebrated Euler have a re-\nference to the theory of fluxions, or the differential and\nintegral calculi. He has, however, three works in par-\nticular that relate to that subject; the first is his Intro-\nductio in Analysis Infinitorum, the second his Institutiones\nCalculi Differentialis, and the third his Institutiones Cal-\nculi Integralis.\n\nThere is a work on this subject which deserves to be\nparticularly mentioned, both on account of its excellence,\nand the singular circumstance of its being composed by\na lady. Its title is, Analytical Institutions, in four books,\noriginally written in Italian, by Donna Maria Gaetana\nAgnesi. This lady was Professor of Mathematics and\nPhilosophy in the University of Bologna; her work was\noriginally published in 1748, and has been styled by\nher countryman Frisi, Opus nitidissimum, ingeniosissimum,\net certe maximum quod adhae ex feminae aliquid calamo\nprodiisset. A part of this work has been published in\nthe French language by Boissut. An English transla-\ntion was prepared for the press many years ago by the\nlate Professor Colson; it remained, however, unpublished,\nand might still have continued so, but for the liberality\nof Baron Macler, who, after satisfying some pecuniary\nclaims upon the manuscript, caused it, in 1801, to be\npublished (we believe at his own expense), in two vo-\nlumes quarto. The Doctrine and Application of Fluxions,\nby Thomas Simpson, is a work deservedly in high esti-\nmation. The Doctrine of Fluxions, by Emerson, is also\nvery generally read by the British mathematicians.\nWe are sorry, however, to observe, that there is no work\nin the English language that exhibits a complete view of\nthe theory of fluxions, with all the improvements that\nhave been made upon it to the present time. We\ncannot at present acquire any tolerable acquaintance\nwith the subject, without consulting the writings of the\nforeign mathematicians. There are several excellent\nworks in the French language; we may mention in\nparticular a Trait\u00e9 de Calcul Differentiel et de Calcul\nIntegral, by Couffin, in 2 vols. 4to.; another by Boissut,\nin 2 vols. 8vo.; and another by La Croix, in 3 vols.\n4to. This last deserves particular notice, as the author\nintended it to comprehend the substance of the various\nvaluable treatises by Euler, as well as of the most im-\nportant academical memoirs that relate to this subject.\nThe author has also published an abridgment of his\nwork, in one volume octavo. Principiorum Calculi\nDifferentialis et Integralis, by L'Huilier, published\nin 1795, contains a very clear exposition of the prin-\nciples of the calculus. The writings of our country-\nmen Landen and Waring, and of these foreign mathe-\nmaticians La Grange, Le Gendre, La Place, and many\nothers, abound with improvements in the calculus.\nHaving given this sketch of the history of this very\nimportant branch of mathematical science, we proceed\nto explain its principles.\n\nPART I. THE DIRECT METHOD OF FLUXIONS.\n\nSect. I. Principles and Definitions.\n\n1. In the application of algebra to the theory of\ncurve lines, we find some of the quantities which\nare the subject of consideration, may be conceived as\nhaving always the same magnitude, as the parameter of\na parabola, and the axes of an ellipse or hyperbola;\nwhile others again are indefinite in respect of magni-\ntude, and may have any number of particular values,\nsuch as the co-ordinates at any point in a curve line.\nThis difference in the nature of the quantities which\nare compared together, has equally place in various\nother theories, both in pure and mixed mathematics,\nand it naturally suggests the division of all quantities\nwhatever into two kinds, namely, such as are constant,\nand such as are variable.\n\n2. A constant quantity is that which retains always\nthe same magnitude, however other quantities with\nwhich it is connected may be supposed to change; and\na variable quantity is that which is indefinite in respect\nof magnitude, or which may be supposed to change its\nvalue. Thus, in the arithmetic of lines, the radius is a\nconstant quantity, while the co-line, sine, tangent, &c.,\nof an arch, also the arch itself, are variable quantities;\nand in the conic sections the axes and the parameters\nof the axes are constant quantities, and any abscissa\nand its corresponding ordinate are variable quantities.\n\nConstant quantities are usually denoted by the first\nletters of the alphabet \\(a, b, c\\), &c. and variable quanti-\nties by the last letters \\(x, y, z\\), &c.\n\n3. Any expression of calculation, containing a va-\nriable quantity, along with other constant quantities, is\ncalled a Function of that variable quantity. Thus, sup-\nposing \\(x\\) to be variable, and the other quantities constant,\nany one of these expressions \\( ax^n + bx^m \\), \\( \\frac{a + bx^m}{c^n + dx^p} \\), \\( ax^n \\log x \\), etc., \\( \\sin x \\), \\( \\tan x \\), etc., is a function of \\( x \\); and in any such equation as \\( y = ax + bx^2 + cx^3 \\), the quantity \\( y \\) is called a function of \\( x \\). Even although the variable quantities \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), should not be separated as in the last example, but should be related to each other as in the following\n\n\\[\nax^2y + bx^3y + y^3 = 0,\n\\]\n\nas, setting aside the consideration of the constant quantities, the value of \\( y \\) depends on that of \\( x \\), and on the contrary the value of \\( x \\) depends upon that of \\( y \\), the quantity \\( y \\) is said to be a function of \\( x \\), and on the other hand \\( x \\) is said to be a function of \\( y \\).\n\n4. If a variable quantity be supposed to change its value, then a corresponding change will take place in the value of any function of that quantity. Let us examine the nature of this change in the magnitude of a function.\n\nFirst, let us suppose that, \\( x \\) denoting any variable quantity, the function to be considered is any integer power of that quantity, as \\( x^2 \\), or \\( x^3 \\), or \\( x^4 \\), etc.; then, \\( x \\) being supposed to be increased by an indefinite quantity \\( h \\), and thus to become \\( x + h \\), the function will change its value; if it be \\( x^2 \\) it will become \\( (x + h)^2 \\), or\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 2xh + h^2;\n\\]\n\nand if it be \\( x^3 \\) it will become \\( (x + h)^3 \\) or\n\n\\[\nx^3 + 3x^2h + 3xh^2 + h^3;\n\\]\n\nand if it be \\( x^4 \\) it will become \\( (x + h)^4 \\), or\n\n\\[\nx^4 + 4x^3h + 6x^2h^2 + 4xh^3 + h^4;\n\\]\n\nand so on, for other integer powers.\n\nIf we compare the new value of the function in each of these cases with its former value, it will immediately appear, that the new value may be resolved into two parts, one of which is the original value of the function, and, therefore, the other is the increment which the function has received, in consequence of the change in the value of the variable quantity \\( x \\). Thus, the function being \\( x^2 \\), we have found its new value to be \\( x^2 + 2xh + h^2 \\), of which expression, the first term \\( x^2 \\) is the original value of the function; therefore the other part of the expression viz. \\( 2xh + h^2 \\) is its increment. In like manner the expression \\( x^3 + 3x^2h + 3xh^2 + h^3 \\), which is the new value of the function \\( x^3 \\), may be resolved into \\( x^3 \\), the original value of the function, and \\( 3x^2h + 3xh^2 + h^3 \\) its increment; and \\( x^4 + 4x^3h + 6x^2h^2 + 4xh^3 + h^4 \\), the new value of the function \\( x^4 \\), may be resolved into \\( x^4 \\), the function itself, and \\( 4x^3h + 6x^2h^2 + 4xh^3 + h^4 \\) its increment.\n\n5. Having seen that, by conceiving the variable quantity \\( x \\) to receive the indefinite increment \\( h \\), the functions \\( x^2 \\), \\( x^3 \\), \\( x^4 \\) receive the increments\n\n\\[\n2xh + h^2,\n\\]\n\\[\n3x^2h + 3xh^2 + h^3,\n\\]\n\\[\n4x^3h + 6x^2h^2 + 4xh^3 + h^4,\n\\]\n\nrespectively, we next observe that each increment is expressed by a series, the first term of which is the first power of the indefinite quantity \\( h \\) multiplied by some function of the variable quantity \\( x \\) as a co-efficient. The second term of the series consists of the second power of \\( h \\), multiplied also by a function of \\( x \\) as a co-efficient; and, in like manner, the third and following terms are composed of the third and higher powers of \\( h \\) (the exponents forming the arithmetical series 1, 2, 3, 4, &c.) each multiplied by a function of \\( x \\), as a coefficient; and it appears, that the particular form of the function which constitutes the coefficient of any assigned term of the series depends entirely upon the particular form of the original function. Thus, when the original function is \\( x^2 \\), the function which is the coefficient of the first term is \\( 2x \\); when the original function is \\( x^3 \\), the coefficient of the first term is \\( 3x^2 \\); when the original function is \\( x^4 \\), the coefficient of the first term is \\( 4x^3 \\), and so on. It also appears that the functions \\( x \\), which are the coefficients of the powers of \\( h \\), are composed only of the variable quantity \\( x \\) and given quantities, so that they are entirely independent of the indefinite increment \\( h \\).\n\n6. These observations may be extended to a function that is any power whatever of a variable quantity, by the application of the binomial theorem. Let \\( x \\) be supposed to become \\( x + h \\), then \\( x^n \\) will become \\( (x + h)^n \\); but by the binomial theorem, (see Algebra, Sect. xvii.) \\( (x + h)^n \\) when expanded into a series, is\n\n\\[\nx^n + \\frac{n}{1}x^{n-1}h + \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2}x^{n-2}h^2 + \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3}x^{n-3}h^3 + \\text{&c.}\n\\]\n\nwhere it appears, that the first term of the series is the original value of the function, and the following terms are the first, second, and following powers of the increment \\( h \\), each multiplied by a new function of \\( x \\), that is independent of the increment. Let us denote the functions \\( x^{n-1}, \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2}x^{n-2}, \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3}x^{n-3}, \\text{&c.} \\) by \\( p, q, r, \\text{&c.} \\) respectively, and it is to be observed that, in the present case, as well as in the case of any other function of \\( x \\) we may hereafter consider, by the letters \\( p, q, r, \\text{&c.} \\) or the same letters with accents over them, or lately the capital letters \\( P, Q, R, \\text{&c.} \\) we do not mean to denote functions of \\( x \\) of any particular form, but functions of \\( x \\) in general, that consist only of \\( x \\) and given quantities. This being kept in view, it appears that the variable quantity \\( x \\) being supposed to change its value, and to become \\( x + h \\), the function \\( x^n \\) changes its value, so as to become\n\n\\[\nx^n + px + qx^2 + rx^3 + sx^4 + \\text{&c.}\n\\]\n\na series, the terms of which have the properties already explained in the two preceding sections.\n\n7. Every rational and integer function of a variable quantity \\( x \\) is necessarily of this form\n\n\\[\nAx^\\alpha + Bx^\\beta + Cx^\\gamma + \\text{&c.}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A, B, C, \\text{&c.} \\) and \\( \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\text{&c.} \\) are supposed to denote constant quantities.\n\nLet us examine what is the form which the function assumes when the variable quantity \\( x \\) changes its value\nDirect Method.\n\nto \\( x + h \\); and to avoid complicated expressions, let us suppose the function to consist of these two terms \\( A x^a + B x^b \\). We have already found in last section that \\( x \\) being supposed to become \\( x + h \\), \\( x^a \\) will become\n\n\\[\nx^a + p h + q h^2 + r h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( p, q, r, \\&c. \\) denote functions of \\( x \\) independent of \\( h \\); as explained in the last section, and consequently \\( A x^a \\) will become\n\n\\[\nA x^a + A p h + A q h^2 + A r h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nIn like manner \\( B x^b \\) will become\n\n\\[\nB x^b + B p' h + B q' h^2 + B r' h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\n\\( p', q', r', \\&c. \\) denoting also functions of \\( x \\) independent of \\( h \\); therefore, taking the sum of the two series, it appears that, supposing \\( x \\) to change its value, and to become \\( x + h \\), the function \\( A x^a + B x^b \\) becomes\n\n\\[\nA x^a + B x^b + (A p + B p') h + (A q + B q') h^2 + (A r + B r') h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nnow \\( p \\) and \\( p' \\) being functions of \\( x \\), \\( A p + B p' \\) will also be a function of \\( x \\), and may be denoted more simply by \\( P \\); and for the same reason \\( A q + B q' \\), \\( A r + B r' \\), \\&c., which are functions of \\( x \\), may be denoted by \\( Q, R, \\&c. \\)\n\nthus the expression for the new value of \\( A x^a + B x^b \\) is\n\n\\[\nA x^a + B x^b + P h + Q h^2 + R h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\na series, the form and properties of which are in all respects analogous to those of the series that expresses the new value of the function \\( x^n \\); and although we have supposed the function to consist of but two terms, yet it is obvious, that whatever be the number of terms, still the form of the series and its properties will be the same; that is, it will consist of two parts, one of which is independent of \\( h \\), and is the original value of the function, and the other is a series, the terms of which are the successive powers of the increment \\( h \\), each multiplied by a function of the variable quantity \\( x \\) as a coefficient.\n\nThis conclusion may be expressed in symbols concisely thus. Let \\( u \\) denote any rational and integer function of a variable quantity \\( x \\), let \\( x \\) be conceived to change its magnitude, and to become \\( x + h \\), and let \\( u' \\) denote the new value which the function acquires in consequence of the change in the value of \\( x \\), then\n\n\\[\nu' = u + p h + q h^2 + r h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( p, q, r, \\&c. \\) denote functions of \\( x \\) as already stated.\n\n8. Suppose next the function of \\( x \\) to be of this form:\n\n\\[\n(A x^a + B x^b + C x^c + \\&c.)^n,\n\\]\n\nthat is, suppose it to be the \\( n \\)th power of a polynomial, consisting of any number of terms whatever. Let the expression between the parenthesis be denoted by \\( v \\), then we are to consider the function \\( v^n \\). Now when \\( x \\) becomes \\( x + h \\), we have already found that \\( v \\) becomes\n\n\\[\nv + p h + q h^2 + r h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\ntherefore \\( v^n \\) will become\n\n\\[\n(v + p h + q h^2 + r h^3 + \\&c.)^n,\n\\]\n\nor, putting \\( p h + q h^2 + r h^3 + \\&c. = M \\),\n\n\\( v^n \\) will become \\((v + M)^n\\),\n\nand this expression when expanded into a series by the binomial theorem is\n\n\\[\nv^n + a v^{n-1} M + b v^{n-2} M^2 + c v^{n-3} M^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a, b, c, \\&c. \\) express numbers.\n\nNow from the form of the series denoted by \\( M \\), it is manifest that its square, cube, or any power of it whatever, will be a series proceeding by the powers of \\( h \\), and having for the coefficients of its terms certain combinations of the quantities \\( p, q, r, \\&c. \\) which being functions of \\( x \\), any combinations of them will also be functions of \\( x \\). Therefore, each of the terms of the above series, expressing the development of \\((v + M)^n\\), excepting the first term \\( v^n \\), will itself be a series proceeding by the powers of \\( h \\), and having its terms multiplied by functions of \\( x \\), and consequently their sum will be a series of the same nature. Let us as before denote the functions of \\( x \\), which are the coefficients of the successive powers of \\( h \\) by \\( P, Q, R, \\&c. \\) and we shall have upon the whole\n\n\\[\n(v + p h + q h^2 + r h^3 + \\&c.)^n\n\\]\n\nexpressed by a series of this form\n\n\\[\nv^n + P h + Q h^2 + R h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\ntherefore, putting the single letter \\( u \\) for the function \\( u^n \\), or for\n\n\\[\n(A x^a + B x^b + C x^c + \\&c.)^n\n\\]\n\nand \\( u' \\) for the new value which \\( u \\) acquires by \\( x \\) changing its value to \\( x + h \\),\n\n\\[\nu' = u + P h + Q h^2 + R h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\na series of the same nature as before.\n\n9. Let us now consider a fractional function of \\( x \\), and let us suppose it to be\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A' x^{a'} + B' x^{b'} + C' x^{c'} + \\&c.}{A x^a + B x^b + C x^c + \\&c.}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( A', A, B', B, \\&c. \\) also \\( a', a, b', b, \\&c. \\) denote constant quantities. Let \\( v \\) denote the numerator of the fraction, and \\( w \\) its denominator, then the function is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v}{w}, \\text{ or } v w^{-1},\n\\]\n\nnow when \\( x \\) becomes \\( x + h \\), \\( v \\) becomes\n\n\\[\nv + p h + q h^2 + r h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nand \\( w^{-1} \\) becomes\n\n\\[\nw^{-1} + p' h + q' h^2 + r' h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nand consequently \\( v w^{-1} \\) becomes\n\n\\[\n(v + p h + q h^2 + \\&c.)(w^{-1} + p' h + q' h^2 + \\&c.)\n\\]\nchange that takes place in the magnitude of the variable quantity from which the function is formed, we may conclude the truth of the following general proposition to be sufficiently established.\n\nLet \\( x \\) denote a variable quantity, and \\( u \\) any function whatever of that quantity, let \\( x \\) be supposed to receive any increment \\( h \\), and thus to become \\( x + h \\), and let \\( u' \\) be the new value which the function acquires by the change in the value of \\( x \\); then, the new value of \\( u \\) may in every case be expressed thus:\n\n\\[\nu' = u + p h + q h^2 + r h^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( p, q, r, \\ldots \\) denote quantities that are quite independent of \\( h \\), and consequently can only involve the variable quantity \\( x \\), and given quantities.\n\n12. Having examined what is the general form that any function of a variable quantity acquires by a change in the value of that quantity, and found it to be a series, the first term of which is always the function itself, it is evident that the remaining terms will express the increment that the function receives, in consequence of the change in the magnitude of the variable quantity from which the function is formed. Let us now compare the simultaneous increments of a variable quantity and its function with each other, and that we may at first avoid general reasoning, and fix the mind more completely, let us suppose the functions to have a determinate form, as \\( x^a, x^b, x^c, \\ldots \\).\n\nPutting \\( u \\) and \\( u' \\) as before to denote the two succeeding values of the function, first let it be supposed that \\( u = x^a \\), then \\( x \\) being supposed to receive the indefinite increment \\( h \\), and thus to become \\( x + h \\), and \\( u \\) to change its value to \\( u' = (x + h)^a \\), we have\n\n\\[\nu' = u + 2 x h + h^2,\n\\]\n\nor,\n\n\\[\nu' = u + 2 x h + h^2,\n\\]\n\nand consequently\n\n\\[\nu' = u + 2 x h + h^2.\n\\]\n\nThus it appears, that the simultaneous increments of \\( x \\) and \\( x^a \\) (or \\( u \\)) are \\( h \\) and \\( 2 x h + h^2 \\), respectively. Let us now compare these increments, not in respect of their absolute magnitudes, but in respect of their ratio to each other, thus we shall have the increment of \\( u \\) to the increment of \\( x \\), as \\( 2 x h + h^2 \\) to \\( h \\), that is, (dividing the two last terms of the proportion by \\( h \\)) as \\( 2 x + h \\) to 1.\n\nOr, instead of employing an analogy, let us, for the sake of brevity, and in conformity to the algebraic notation, rather express each of these ratios by the quotient arising from the division of the antecedents of the ratio by its consequents, and put the results equal to each other. Then, observing that the symbol \\( u' - u \\), which expresses the difference between the succeeding values of the function, may be employed to denote its increment, we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{u' - u}{h} = \\frac{2 x h + h^2}{h} = 2 x + h.\n\\]\n\nHence it appears that the expression for the ratio of the increment of the function \\( u \\) to the increment of the variable quantity \\( x \\) is made up of two parts, one of these, viz. \\( 2 x \\), is quite independent of \\( h \\), the increment of \\( x \\), and the other is in the present case that increment itself. In consequence of this peculiarity in the form\nDirect Method:\n\nform of the expression for the ratio, it is evident that if the increment \\( h \\) be conceived to be continually diminished, the part of the expression which consists of \\( h \\) will continually diminish, so that the whole expression, viz. \\( 2x + h \\), may become more nearly equal to its first term \\( 2x \\) than by any assignable difference; therefore \\( 2x \\) may be considered as the limit of the ratio \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\), that is, a quantity to which the ratio may approach nearer than by any assignable difference, but to which it cannot be considered as becoming absolutely equal.\n\nLet us next suppose that \\( u = x^3 \\), then \\( x \\) being supposed to become \\( x + h \\), we have \\( u' = (x + h)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2h + 3xh^2 + h^3 \\), or\n\n\\[\nu' = u + 3x^2h + 3xh^2 + h^3,\n\\]\n\nand consequently\n\n\\[\nu' - u = 3x^2h + 3xh^2 + h^3,\n\\]\n\nand \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} = 3x^2 + 3xh + h^2 \\).\n\nHere it is evident, as in the former case, that the expression for the ratio \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\) is composed of two parts, one of these, viz. the first term \\( 3x^2 \\), is a function of \\( x \\) that is independent of the increment \\( h \\), but the other, viz. \\( 3xh + h^2 \\), or \\( h(3x + h) \\), is the product of two factors, one of which is the increment itself. From the particular form of this latter part of the expression for the ratio, it is plain, that \\( h \\) being supposed to be continually diminished, that part will also diminish, and may become less than any assignable quantity. Therefore in this case, as well as in the former, the ratio \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\) has a limit, and that limit is the first term of the general expression for the ratio, namely the quantity \\( 3x^2 \\).\n\nSuppose, next, that \\( u = x^4 \\), and consequently\n\n\\[\nu' = (x + h)^4 = x^4 + 4x^3h + 6x^2h^2 + 4xh^3 + h^4,\n\\]\n\nor,\n\n\\[\nu' = u + 4x^3h + 6x^2h^2 + 4xh^3 + h^4,\n\\]\n\nand \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} = 4x^3 + h(6x^2 + 4xh + h^2) \\).\n\nHere, as in the two former cases, we have only to inspect the general expression for the ratio \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\) to discover, that by supposing \\( h \\) to be continually diminished, the latter part of the expression, viz. \\( h(6x^2 + 4xh + h^2) \\), and which comprises all the terms except the first, will become smaller than any assignable quantity; and consequently, that the first term \\( 4x^3 \\) is the limit of the ratio.\n\n13. It is easy to see that the property which we have found to belong to the ratio of the simultaneous increments of a variable quantity, and its function in these three particular cases, is an immediate consequence of the form of the expression for the increment of the function, so that it is not peculiar to the functions \\( x^2 \\), \\( x^3 \\), and \\( x^4 \\), but belongs equally to all functions whatever.\n\nFor we have found, \u00a7 11, that \\( u \\) being supposed to denote any function of a variable quantity \\( x \\), as for example, \\( ax^n \\), or \\( ax^m + bx^n + &c. \\), or\n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax^m + bx^n + &c.}{ax'^m + bx'^n + &c.}\n\\]\n\nand \\( u' \\) being put for the new value which the function acquires when \\( x \\) becomes \\( x + h \\),\n\n\\[\nu' = u + p + qh + rh^2 + &c.,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( p, q, r, &c. \\) denote functions of \\( x \\) that are independent of \\( h \\); therefore,\n\n\\[\nu' - u = ph + qh^2 + rh^3 + &c.,\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\frac{u' - u}{h} = p + qh + rh^2 + &c.,\n\\]\n\nor,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{u' - u}{h} = p + h(q + rh + &c.)\n\\]\n\nThus it appears, that whatever be the form of the function, the ratio \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\) is always expressed by a quantity which may be resolved into two parts; one of these, viz. \\( p \\), is independent of the increment \\( h \\), and the other, viz. \\( h(q + rh + &c.) \\), is the product of \\( h \\) by a series, the first term of which is a function of \\( x \\), and the remaining terms also functions of \\( x \\) multiplied by the first, second, third, and higher powers of \\( h \\). Now from the particular form of this last part of the general expression for the ratio, it is manifest, that \\( h \\) being conceived to be continually diminished, the quantity \\( h(q + rh + &c.) \\) will also be continually diminished, and may become less than any assignable quantity; therefore, the limit of the ratio \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\) is simply \\( p \\), that is, the function of \\( x \\), which is the coefficient of the first or simple power of \\( h \\) in the general expression for the increment.\n\n14. From what has been just shewn, we may infer the truth of the following general proposition relative to the simultaneous changes that take place in a variable quantity and its function.\n\nLet \\( x \\) denote a variable quantity and \\( u \\) any function of that quantity, let \\( x \\) be conceived to change its value and become \\( x + h \\), where \\( h \\) denotes an arbitrary increment, and let \\( u' \\) denote the new value that the function acquires, in consequence of the change in the magnitude of \\( x \\). Then, observing that \\( h \\) and \\( u' - u \\) are the simultaneous increments of the variable quantity and its function, if \\( h \\) be conceived to be continually diminished, the ratio \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\) will continually approach to a certain Limit, which will be different for different functions, but always the same for the same function, and in every case quite independent of the magnitude of the increments.\n\nThe ratio which is the limit of the ratio of the increments, when these increments are conceived to be continually diminished, may be called the limiting ratio of the increments.\n\n15. The analytical fact contained in the preceding proposition affords the foundation for a mathematical theory of great extent, and which may be divided into\ninto two distinct branches; one having for its object the resolution of the following problem. Having given the relation of any number of variable quantities to each other, to determine the limiting ratios of their increments; and the other the converse of that problem, namely, Having given the limiting ratios, to determine the relations of the quantities themselves.\n\nThe theory to which we have alluded constitutes the Method of Fluxions, and in explaining the foundation of the method, we have endeavoured to show, that it rests upon a principle purely analytical, namely the theory of limiting ratios; and this being the case, the subject may be treated as a branch of pure mathematics, without having occasion to introduce any ideas foreign to geometry.\n\n16. Sir Isaac Newton, however, in first delivering the principles of the method, thought proper to employ considerations drawn from the theory of motion. But he appears to have done this chiefly for the purpose of illustration, for he immediately has recourse to the theory of limiting ratios, and it has been the opinion of several mathematicians of great eminence (A) that the consideration of motion was introduced into the method of fluxions at first without necessity, and that succeeding writers on the subject ought to have established the theory upon principles purely mathematical, independent of the ideas of time, and velocity, both of which seem foreign to investigations relating to abstract quantity.\n\n17. That we may conform to the usual method of treating this subject, we proceed to show how the theory of motion is commonly applied to the illustration of the nature of variable quantities, and of the relations that result from their being conceived to change their value.\n\nAs quantities of every kind, if we abstract from their position, figure, and such affections, and consider their magnitude only, may be represented by lines, we may consider a variable quantity \\( x \\), and \\( u \\) any function of that quantity, to be represented by two lines \\( AP, BQ \\), which have \\( A, B \\), one extremity of each given, and which vary by the points \\( P, Q \\), their other extremities, moving in the directions \\( AC, BD \\), while the equation expressing the relation between \\( x \\) and \\( u \\), or their representative lines \\( AP, BQ \\), remains always the same.\n\n18. The lines \\( AP, BQ \\) being thus conceived to vary, the relation that is supposed always to subsist between them, in respect of their magnitudes, will necessarily give rise to another relation, namely, that which will constantly subsist between the velocities of the moving points \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\), by which the lines are generated.\n\nWith a reference to this particular mode of conceiving variable quantities to exist, the quantities themselves have been called flowing quantities or fluents, and the measures of the velocities with which the variable quantities increase have been called their fluxions.\n\n19. To simplify the hypothesis, we may suppose that the point which generates the line \\( AP \\), or \\( x \\), moves uniformly; thus the measure of its velocity, or the fluxion of \\( x \\), will be a given quantity, with which the measure of the velocity of the point \\( Q \\), or the fluxion of \\( u \\), may be continually compared. To determine then the fluxions, or rather the ratio of the fluxions of \\( x \\) a variable quantity, and \\( u \\), any function of that quantity, is in effect to resolve the following problem.\n\nHaving given an equation expressing the relation at every instant between the spaces passed over by two points, one of which moves with a uniform velocity. It is required to find an expression for the ratio that the measures of the velocities have at every instant to each other.\n\n20. Now it is a fundamental principle in the theory of motion, resulting indeed from the very nature of a variable velocity, that when two velocities are compared together, whether they be both variable, or one of them uniform, and the other variable, the measures of their velocities are any quantities having to each other the ratio that is the limit of the ratio of the spaces described in the same time, when those spaces are conceived to be continually diminished. And hence it follows that the ratio of the fluxions of two variable quantities is no other than the limiting ratio of their simultaneous increments.\n\nThat the theory of motion may be applied to the generation of variable algebraic quantities, we have supposed them to be represented by lines; this however is not necessary, if the variable quantities are themselves geometrical magnitudes; for like as a line is conceived to be generated by the motion of a point, so a surface may be considered as generated by the motion of a line, a solid by the motion of a surface, and an angle by the rotation of one of the lines which contain it; and the fluxions of those quantities at any instant, or position, will be the measures of the velocities, or degrees of swiftness, according to which they increase at that instant or position.\n\nBut in every case the ratio of the rates of increase, or fluxions of two homogeneous magnitudes, will be the limiting ratio of their simultaneous increments.\n\n21. Having thus found that by conceiving variable quantities as generated by motion, and taking their velocities, or rates of increase, as an object for the mind to contemplate and reason on, we are in the end led to the consideration of the limiting ratios of their increments, a subject which is purely mathematical, and independent of the ideas of time or velocity, we shall exchange the definition of a fluxion given in \u00a7 18, which involves those ideas, for another that rests entirely upon the existence of limiting ratios.\n\nBy the fluxions then of two variable quantities having any assigned relation to each other, we are in the following treatise always to be understood to mean any indefinite\n\n(A) Such as Lagrange, Cousin, La Croix, &c., abroad, and Landen in this country.\nindefinite quantities which have to each other the limiting ratio of their simultaneous increments (u).\n\nIn conformity to this definition of fluxions it is evident that we are to consider them, not as absolute, but as relative quantities, which derive their origin from the comparison of variable quantities with each other in respect of their simultaneous variations of magnitude.\n\n22. Sir Isaac Newton employed different symbols at different times to denote the fluxions of variable quantities. It is now however common in Britain to denote them by the same letters employed to express the quantities themselves, and each having a dot over it. Thus \\( \\dot{x} \\) denotes the fluxion of the variable quantity expressed by \\( x \\), and in the like manner \\( \\dot{u}, \\dot{v}, \\dot{z} \\), denote the fluxions of the variable quantities \\( u, v, z \\), respectively.\n\n23. Suppose now that \\( u \\) is any function of a variable quantity \\( x \\), and that the limiting ratio of the simultaneous increments of \\( u \\) and \\( x \\) is the ratio of \\( p \\) to 1, where \\( p \\) denotes some other function of \\( x \\), then, from the definition just given of fluxions, we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{u}}{\\dot{x}} = p, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\dot{u} = p\n\\]\n\nHence it follows as a consequence of the preceding definition, that the fluxion of \\( u \\), any function of a variable quantity \\( x \\), is the product arising from the multiplication of that function of \\( x \\) which is the expression for the limiting ratio of the increments by the fluxion of the variable quantity \\( x \\) itself.\n\nSect. II. Investigation of the Rules of the Direct Method of Fluxions.\n\n24. The method of fluxions naturally resolves itself into two parts, as we have already observed, \u00a7 15. We proceed to explain the first of these, which is called the Direct Method, and which treats of finding the ratios of the fluxions of variable quantities, having given the relations of those quantities to each other.\n\n25. We shall begin with investigating the ratio of the fluxions of two variable quantities in that particular case, when one of them is any power of the other.\n\nLet us suppose then, that \\( u \\) is such a function of a variable quantity \\( x \\), that \\( u = x^n \\), where \\( n \\) denotes any number whatever, it is required to determine the ratio of the fluxions of \\( u \\) and \\( x \\).\n\nIf we recur to the definition which has been given of the fluxions of variable quantities in \u00a7 21, it will appear that we have in effect resolved the problem just proposed in three particular cases, when treating of the limiting ratios of the increments of variable quantities. For it has been shown in \u00a7 12, that when \\( u = x^2 \\), and \\( x \\) is supposed to change its value, so as to become \\( x + h \\), where \\( h \\) denotes an indefinite increment, and in consequence of this change in the magnitude of \\( x \\), \\( u \\) also changes its value, and becomes \\( u' \\), then, observing that \\( u' - u \\) and \\( h \\) are the simultaneous increments of \\( u \\) and \\( x \\), the limiting ratio of \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\) is \\( 2x \\). Let this expression for the limiting ratio be put equal to the ratio of the fluxions of \\( u \\) and \\( x \\), that is to \\( \\frac{\\dot{u}}{\\dot{x}} \\); thus we have \\( \\frac{\\dot{u}}{\\dot{x}} = 2x \\), and \\( \\dot{u} = 2x \\dot{x} \\).","sp":321,"ep":330},{"h":"FLUXIONS","t":"Inverse Method\n\nLet us suppose we know that when \\( x = a \\), then \\( y = b \\); assume \\( x = a + t \\), and \\( y = b + u \\), then it is manifest, that, if the value of \\( u \\) be found by a series involving \\( t \\), all the terms of the series ought to vanish when \\( t = 0 \\).

Whatever difficulties occur in finding the primitive equation of a fluxional equation of the first order, it will easily be conceived, that these difficulties must be greater and more numerous when we have to consider fluxional equations of the second and higher orders.\n\nOne of the most simple cases of an equation of the second order is this\n\n\\[\n\\dot{y} - X \\dot{x}^2 = 0, \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{\\dot{y}}{x^2} = X,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( X \\) denotes a function of \\( x \\), the variable quantity whose fluxion is supposed to be constant; in this case, because \\( \\frac{\\dot{y}}{x^2} = X \\dot{x} \\), we have \\( \\frac{\\dot{y}}{x} = \\int X \\dot{x} \\). Let \\( P \\) denote that function of which \\( X \\dot{x} \\) is the fluxion, and \\( c \\), as usual, an indeterminate constant quantity, then \\( \\frac{\\dot{y}}{x} = P + c \\), and \\( \\dot{y} = P \\dot{x} + c \\dot{x} \\), and taking the fluents a second time\n\n\\[\n\\dot{y} = \\int P \\dot{x} + c \\dot{x} + c'\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( c' \\) denotes a second indeterminate constant quantity.\n\nAs \\( \\int P \\dot{x} = P x - \\int \\dot{P} x = x \\int X \\dot{x} - \\int X x \\dot{x} \\)\n\nwe have also\n\n\\[\ny = x \\int X \\dot{x} - \\int X x \\dot{x} + c x + c'.\n\\]\n\nSuppose, for example, that the equation is \\( y = ax^3 = 0 \\),\n\nso that \\( \\frac{\\dot{y}}{x^3} = ax^2 \\); here \\( X = ax \\), and therefore\n\n\\[\ny = x \\int ax^2 - \\int ax^3 + c x + c'\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} ax^3 - \\frac{1}{3} ax^3 + c x + c'\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{6} ax^3 + c x + c'.\n\\]\n\nIn the very same manner we may deduce from the equation of the third order\n\n\\[\n\\dot{y} - X \\dot{x}^3 = 0, \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{\\dot{y}}{x^3} = X\n\\]\n\nits primitive equation; thus we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{y}}{x^3} = X \\dot{x}, \\quad \\frac{\\dot{y}}{x^2} = \\int X \\dot{x} = P + c,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( P \\) denotes such a function of \\( x \\), that its fluxion is \\( X \\dot{x} \\), and \\( c \\) represents a constant quantity. Again\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{y}}{x} = P \\dot{x} + c \\dot{x},\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{y}}{x} = \\int P \\dot{x} + c \\dot{x} + c' = Q + c x + c';\n\\]\n\nhere \\( Q \\) is put for \\( \\int P \\dot{x} \\), and \\( c' \\) for a second constant quantity.

Let us next consider such equations as involve only \\( \\frac{\\dot{y}}{x^2} \\) and constant quantities. In order to abridge let us put \\( \\frac{\\dot{y}}{x^2} = p \\), then such an equation may be generally expressed thus \\( \\frac{\\dot{y}}{x^2} = P \\), where \\( P \\) denotes some known\nknown function of \\( p \\); now as \\( \\frac{y}{x} = p \\), by taking the fluxions, and observing that \\( x \\) is constant, we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{y}}{x^2} = \\frac{\\dot{p}}{x}, \\quad \\text{hence} \\quad \\frac{\\dot{p}}{x} = P, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\dot{x} = \\frac{\\dot{p}}{P}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\int \\frac{\\dot{p}}{P};\n\\]\n\nlet the value of \\( \\dot{x} \\) be substituted instead of it in the equation \\( y = p \\dot{x} \\), and it becomes \\( \\dot{y} = \\frac{\\dot{p}}{P} \\) and hence\n\n\\[\ny = \\int \\frac{\\dot{p}}{P};\n\\]\n\nthus it appears that if we can find the fluents \\( \\int \\frac{\\dot{p}}{P} \\) and \\( \\int \\frac{\\dot{p}}{P} \\), we shall have the primitive equation when we eliminate \\( p \\) by means of these two equations\n\n\\[\nx = c + \\int \\frac{\\dot{p}}{P}, \\quad y = c' + \\int \\frac{\\dot{p}}{P},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( c \\) and \\( c' \\) denote the two indeterminate constant quantities that ought to enter into the primitive equation.\n\nSuppose for example that the equation is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x^2 + y^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{x} = a,\n\\]\n\nwhich, by putting \\( p \\) for \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\), and \\( \\frac{\\dot{p}}{x} \\) for \\( \\frac{\\dot{y}}{x^2} \\) becomes transformed to\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(1 + p^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{p} = a;\n\\]\n\nhence we have\n\n\\[\n\\dot{x} = -\\frac{a p}{(1 + p^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}, \\quad \\dot{y} = p \\dot{x} = \\frac{-a p \\dot{p}}{(1 + p^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}},\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = c - \\frac{a p}{\\sqrt{(1 + p^2)}}, \\quad y = c' + \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{(1 + p^2)}};\n\\]","sp":399,"ep":400},{"h":"FLY","t":"in Zoology, a large order of insects, the distinguishing characteristic of which is, that their wings are transparent.

The tree is of the mulberry kind, and its leaves are usually very largely stocked with these insect bags; and the generality of them are found to contain the insects in their worm state; when they become winged, they soon make their way out. The bags begin to appear when the leaves are young, and afterwards grow with them; but they never rumple the leaf or injure its shape. They are of the kind of leaf-galls, and partake in all respects, except size, of a species we have frequent on the large maple, or, as it is called, the ficamore.\n\nFlyers, in architecture, such stairs as go straight, and do not wind round, or have the steps made tapering; but the fore and back part of each stair and the ends respectively parallel to one another: So that if one flight do not carry you to your designed height, there is a broad half space; and then you fly again, with steps everywhere of the same breadth and length as before.\n\nFlyers, the performers in a celebrated exhibition among the Mexicans, which was made on certain great festivals, and is thus described by Clavigero in his History of that people. \"They fought in the woods for an extremely lofty tree, which, after stripping it of its branches and bark, they brought to the city, and fixed in the centre of some large square. They called the point of the tree in a wooden cylinder, which, on account of some resemblance in its shape, the Spaniards called a mortar. From this cylinder hung four strong ropes, which served to support a square frame. In the space between the cylinder and the frame, they fixed four other thick ropes, which they twisted as many times round the tree as there were revolutions to be made by the flyers. These ropes were drawn through four holes, made in the middle of the four planks of which the frame consisted. The four principal flyers, disguised like eagles, herons, and other birds, mounted the tree with great agility, by means of a rope which was laced about it from the ground up to the frame; from the frame they mounted one at a time successively upon the cylinder, and after having danced there a little, they tied themselves round with the ends of the ropes, which were drawn through the holes of the frame, and launching with a spring from it, began their flight with their wings expanded. The action of their bodies put the frame and the cylinder in motion; the frame by its revolutions gradually untwisted the cords by which the flyers swung; so that as the ropes lengthened, they made so much the greater circles in their flight. Whilst these four were flying, a fifth danced upon the cylinder, beating a little drum, or waving a flag, without the smallest apprehension of the danger he was in of being precipitated from such a height. The others who were upon the frame (10 or 12 persons generally mounted), as soon as they saw the flyers in their last revolution, precipitated themselves by the same ropes, in order to reach the ground at the same time amidst the acclamations of the populace. Those who precipitated themselves in this manner by the ropes, that they might make a still greater display of their agility,\nFlying agility, frequently passed from one rope to another, at that part where, on account of the little distance between them, it was possible for them to do so. The most essential point of this performance consisted in proportioning to justify the height of the tree with the length of the ropes, that the flyers should reach the ground with 13 revolutions, to represent by such number their century of 52 years, composed in the manner we have already mentioned. This celebrated diversion is still in use in that kingdom; but no particular attention is paid to the number of the revolutions of the flyers; as the frame is commonly hexagonal or octagonal, and the flyers six or eight in number. In some places they put a rail round the frame, to prevent accidents, which were frequent after the conquest; as the Indians became much given to drinking, and used to mount the tree when intoxicated with wine or brandy, and were unable to keep their station on so great a height, which was usually 60 feet.","sp":402,"ep":408},{"h":"FLYING","t":"the progressive motion of a bird, or other winged animal, in the air.\n\nThe parts of birds chiefly concerned in flying are the wings and tail; by the first, the bird sustains and wafts himself along; and by the second, he is assisted, in ascending and descending, to keep his body poised and upright, and to obviate the vacillations thereof.\n\nIt is by the size and strength of the pectoral muscles, that birds are so well disposed for quick, strong, and continued flying. These muscles, which in men are scarcely a 70th part of the muscles of the body, in birds exceed and outweigh all the other muscles taken together; upon which Mr Willoughby makes this reflection, that if it be possible for a man to fly, his wings must be so contrived and adapted, that he may make use of his legs, and not his arms, in managing them.\n\nThe tail, Messrs Willoughby, Ray, and many others, imagine to be principally employed in steering and turning the body in the air, as a rudder; but Borelli has put it beyond all doubt, that this is the least use of it, which is chiefly to assist the bird in its ascent and descent in the air, and to obviate the vacillations of the body and wings; for, as to turning to this or that side, it is performed by the wings and inclination of the body, and but very little by the help of the tail. The flying of a bird, in effect, is quite a different thing from the rowing of a vessel. Birds do not vibrate their wings towards the tail, as oars are struck towards the stern, but waft them downwards; nor does the tail of the bird cut the air at right angles as the rudder does the water; but is disposed horizontally, and preserves the same situation whatever way the bird turns. In effect, as a vessel is turned about on its centre of gravity to the right, by a brisk application of the oars to the left; so a bird, in beating the air with its right wing alone, towards the tail, will turn its fore part to the left. Thus pigeons changing their course to the left, would labour it with their right wing, keeping the other almost at rest. Birds of a long neck alter their course by the inclination of their head and neck; which altering the course of gravity, the bird will proceed in a new direction.\n\nThe manner of Flying is thus. The bird first bends his legs, and springs with a violent leap from the ground; then opens and expands the joints of his wings, so as to make a right line perpendicular to the sides of his body: thus the wings, with all the feathers therein, constitute one continued lamina. Being now raised a little above the horizon, and vibrating the wings with great force and velocity perpendicularly against the subject air, that fluid resists those succussions, both from its natural inactivity and elasticity, by means of which the whole body of the bird is protruded. The resistance the air makes to the withdrawing of the wings, and consequently the progress of the bird, will be so much the greater, as the waft or stroke of the fan of the wing is longer: but as the force of the wing is continually diminished by this resistance, when the two forces continue to be in equilibrium, the bird will remain suspended in the same place; for the bird only ascends so long as the arch of air the wing describes makes a resistance equal to the excess of the specific gravity of the bird above the air. If the air, therefore, be so rare as to give way with the same velocity as it is struck withal, there will be no resistance, and consequently the bird can never mount. Birds never fly upwards in a perpendicular line, but always in a parabola. In a direct ascent, the natural and artificial tendency would oppose and destroy each other, so that the progress would be very slow. In a direct descent they would aid one another, so that the fall would be too precipitate.\n\nArtificial Flying, that attempted by men, by the affluence of mechanics.\n\nThe art of flying has been attempted by several persons in all ages. The Leucadians, out of superstition, are reported to have had a custom of precipitating a man from a high cliff into the sea, first fixing feathers, variously expanded, round his body, in order to break the fall.\n\nFriar Bacon, who lived near 500 years ago, not only affirms the art of flying possible, but affords us, that he himself knew how to make an engine wherein a man fitting might be able to convey himself through the air like a bird; and further adds, that there was then one who had tried it with success. The secret consisted in a couple of large thin hollow copper globes, exhausted of air; which being much lighter than air, would sustain a chair whereon a person might sit. Father Francisco Lana, in his Prodromo, proposes the same thing, as his own thought. He computes, that a round vessel of plate brass, 14 feet in diameter, weighing three ounces the square foot, will only weigh 1848 ounces; whereas a quantity of air of the same bulk will weigh 2155\u00bd ounces; so that the globe will not only be sustained in the air, but will carry with it a weight of 373\u00bd ounces; and by increasing the bulk of the globe, without increasing the thickness of the metal, he adds, a vessel might be made to carry a much greater weight.\u2014But the fallacy is obvious: a globe of the dimensions he describes, Dr Hook shows, would not sustain the prelure of the air, but be crushed inwards. Besides, in whatever ratio the bulk of the globe were increased, in the same must the thickness of the metal, and consequently the weight be increased: so that there would be no advantage in such augmentation. See Aerostation.\n\nThe same author describes an engine for flying, invented by the Sieur Belnier, a smith of Sabl\u00e9, in the county of Maine. Vid. Philosoph. Collect. No. 1.\nThe philosophers of King Charles the second's reign were mightily busied about this art. The famous Bishop Wilkins was so confident of success in it, that he says, he does not question but in future ages it will be as usual to hear a man call for his wings, when he is going a journey, as it is now to call for his boots.\n\nFlying Bridge.

Vapours may be seen on the high grounds as well as the low, but more especially about marshy places. They are easily diffused by the wind, as also by the heat of the sun.

He discovered an early turn for the sciences, and a strong passion for arms; which last was so inflamed by reading Caesar's Commentaries, that he enlisted at 16 years of age. His father got him off, and shut him in a monastery; but he made his escape in about two years after, and entered himself a second time in quality of cadet. His inclination for military affairs, and the great pains he took to accomplish himself in that way, recommended him to notice; and he was admitted into the friendship of the first rate officers. M. de Vendome, who commanded in Italy in 1720, made him his aide-de-camp, having conceived the highest regard for him; and soon after sent him with part of his forces into Lombardy. He was entirely trusted by the commander of that army; and no measures were concerted, or steps taken, without consulting him. By pursuing his plans, many places were taken, and advantages gained; and such, in short, were his services, that he had a pension of 400 livres settled upon him, and was honoured with the crois of St Louis. He distinguished himself greatly, August 15, 1705, at the battle of Caffano; where he received a wound upon his left hand, which deprived him of the use of it ever after. It was at this battle that he conceived the first idea of that system of columns, which he afterwards prefixed to his Commentaries upon Polybius. The duke of Orleans sending De Vendome again into Italy in 1706, Folard had orders to throw himself into Modena to defend it against Eugene: where, though he acquitted himself with his usual skill, he was very near being assassinated. The description which he has given of the conduct and character of the governor of this town, may be found in his Treatise of the Defence of Places, and deserves to be read. He received a dangerous wound on the thigh at the battle of Malplaquet, and was some time after made prisoner by Prince Eugene. Being exchanged in 1711, he was made\nFolc-lands, made governor of Bourbourg. In 1714, he went to Folcmote, Malta, to assist in defending that island against the Turks. Upon his return to France, he embarked for Sweden, having a passionate desire to see Charles XII. He acquired the esteem and confidence of that famous general, who sent him to France to negotiate the re-establishment of James II. upon the throne of England; but that project being dropped, he returned to Sweden, followed Charles XII. in his expedition to Norway, and served under him at the siege of Fredrikshall, where that prince was killed, Dec. 11, 1718.\n\nPolard then returned to France; and made his last campaign in 1719, under the duke of Berwick, in quality of colonel. From that time he applied himself intensely to the study of the military art as far as it could be studied at home; and built his theories upon the foundation of his experience and observations on facts. He contracted an intimacy with Count Saxe, who, as he then declared, would one day prove a very great general. He was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1749; and, in 1751, made a journey to Avignon, where he died in 1752, aged 83 years. He was the author of several works, the principal of which are: 1. Commentaries upon Polybius, in five volumes, 4to. 2. A Book of New Discoveries in War. 3.

A Mr Cappel, once professor of Hebrew at Saumur, was his private tutor. When 17 years of age, he was sent to Clare-hall, Cambridge, where he successfully applied himself to the study of philosophy and the mathematics; and when only twenty-three years of age he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society. His ingenious communications acquired him so much applause, that he was frequently chosen into its council. He was in habits of friendship with the illustrious Newton, at that time president, and by his influence was elected one of the vice-presidents in the year 1723. Mr Folkes became a candidate for the chair on the death of Sir Isaac Newton; but the superior interest of Sir Hans Sloane rendered his application ineffectual. In 1733, and the two subsequent years, his residence was for the most part in Italy, with the view of improving himself in the knowledge of classical antiquities. To ascertain the weight and value of ancient coins, he carefully consulted the cabinets of the curious; and on his return home he presented to the Antiquarian Society, of which he was a member, a dissertation on this subject. He read before the same learned body, a dissertation on the measurement of Trajan's and Antonine's pillars, together with other remains of antiquity. The fruits of his observations he presented to the Royal Society; and, in particular, \"Remarks on the standard measure preserved in the Capitol of Rome,\" and the model of an ancient globe in the Farnesian palace. He visited Paris in 1739, where he was received with great respect, and honoured with the company of the most eminent literary characters in that metropolis. This respect indeed he was entitled to by his unwearied application to many branches of knowledge which were both curious and useful. His valuable work, entitled \"A table of English silver coins, from the Norman Conquest to the present time, with their weights, intrinsic values, and some remarks upon the several pieces,\" was printed in the year 1745. Among the many honours conferred upon Mr Folkes, he was created doctor of laws by both universities, and chosen president of the Antiquarian Society. He continued to furnish the Philosophical Transactions with many learned papers, till his career was stopped by a paralytic stroke, which terminated his useful life in the year 1754.

It is situated on a mountain, which hangs over the Yellow river, and encloses with its walls several fertile little hills. Its jurisdiction is very extensive: for it comprehends 18 cities; five of which are of the second, and 13 of the third class. As this was the birth-place of the emperor Hong-vou, chief of the preceding dynasty, this prince formed a design of rendering it a famous and magnificent city, in order to make it the seat of empire. After having expelled the Western Tartars, who had taken possession of China, he transferred his court hither, and named the city Fong-yang; that is to say, \"The Place of the Eagle's Splendour.\" His intention, as we have said, was to beautify and enlarge it; but the inequality of the ground, the scarcity of fresh water, and above all the vicinity of his father's tomb, made him change his design. By the unanimous advice of his principal officers, this prince established his court at Nan-king, a more beautiful and commodious place. When he had formed this resolution, a stop was put to the intended works: the imperial palace which was to have been enclosed by a triple wall, the Fontaine, walls of the city to which a circumference of nine leagues were assigned, and the canals that were begun, all were abandoned; and nothing was finished, but three monuments that still remain. The extent and magnificence of these sufficiently show what the beauty of this city would have been, had the emperor pursued his original design. The first is the tomb of the father of Hong-vou, to decorate which no expense was spared; it is called Hoan-lin, or the Royal Tomb. The second is a tower built in the middle of the city, which is of an oblong form, and 100 feet high. The third is a magnificent temple erected to the god Fo. At first it was only a pagod, to which Hong-vou retired after having lost his parents, and where he was admitted as an inferior domestic; but, having soon become weary of this kind of life, he enlisted with the chief of a band of banditti, who had revolted from the Tartars. As he was bold and enterprising, the general made choice of him for his son-in-law; soon after, he was declared his successor by the unanimous voice of the troops. The new chief, seeing himself at the head of a large party, had the presumption to carry his views to the throne. The Tartars, informed of the progress of his arms, sent a numerous army into the field; but he surprized and attacked them with so much impetuosity, that they were obliged to fly; and, though they several times returned to the charge, they were still defeated, and at length driven entirely out of China. As soon as he mounted the throne, he caused the superb temple which we have mentioned to be raised out of gratitude to the Bonzes, who had received him in his distress, and assigned them a revenue sufficient for the maintenance of 300 persons, under a chief of their own feet, whom he constituted a mandarin, with power of governing them, independent of the officers of the city.

At the age of 19 he entered amongst the Oratorians, but quitted that order 18 months after. He was 22 years of age before he knew his own talents for poetry; but hearing an ode of Malherbe read, upon the affirmation of Henry IV., he was so taken with admiration of it, that the poetical fire, which had before lain dormant within him, seemed to be enkindled from that of the other great poet. He applied himself to read, to meditate, to repeat, in fine to imitate, the works of Malherbe. The first essays of his pen he confined to one of his relations who made him read the best Latin authors, Horace, Virgil, Terence, Quintilian, &c. and then the best\nbest compositions in French and Italian. He applied himself likewise to the study of the Greek authors, particularly Plato and Plutarch. Some time afterwards his parents made him marry a daughter of a lieutenant-general, a relation of the great Racine. This young lady, besides her very great beauty, was remarkable for the delicacy of her wit, and Fontaine never composed any work without consulting her. But as her temper was none of the best, to avoid diffusion, he separated himself from her company as often as he well could. The famous duchess of Bouillon, niece to Cardinal Mazarine, being exiled to Chateau-Thierry, took particular notice of Fontaine. Upon her recall, he followed her to Paris; where by the interest of one of his relations, he got a pension settled upon him. He met with great friends and protectors amongst the most distinguished persons of the court, but Madame de la Sabli\u00e8re was the most particular. She took him to live at her house, and it was then that Fontaine, divested of domestic concerns, led a life conformable to his disposition, and cultivated an acquaintance with all the great men of the age. It was his custom, after he was fixed at Paris, to go every year, during the month of September, to his native place of Chateau-Thierry, and pay a visit to his wife, carrying with him Racine, Defreux, Chapelle, or some other celebrated writers. When he has sometimes gone thither alone by himself, he has come away without remembering even to call upon her; but seldom omitted telling some part of his lands, by which means he squandered away a considerable fortune. After the death of Madame de la Sabli\u00e8re, he was invited into England, particularly by Madame Mazarine, and by St Evremont, who promised him all the sweets and comforts of life; but the difficulty of learning the English language, and the liberality of the duke of Burgundy, prevented his voyage.\n\nAbout the end of the year 1692 he fell dangerously ill; and, as is customary upon these occasions in the Roman church, he made a general confession of his whole life to P. Poguet, an Oratorian; and, before he received the sacrament, he sent for the gentlemen of the French Academy, and in their presence declared his sincere compunction for having composed his Tales; a work he could not reflect upon without the greatest repentance and detestation; promising that if it should please God to restore his health, he would employ his talents only in writing upon matters of morality or piety. He survived this illness two years, living in the most exemplary and edifying manner, and died the 13th of March 1695, being 74 years of age. When they stripped his body, they found next his skin a hair shirt; which gave room for the following expression of the younger Racine:\n\nEt l'Auteur de Jaconde est orn\u00e9 d'un Cilice.\n\nFontaine's character is remarkable for a simplicity, candour, and probity, seldom to be met with. He was of an obliging disposition; cultivating a real friendship with his brother poets and authors; and what is very rare, beloved and esteemed by them all. His conversation was neither gay nor brilliant, especially when he was not amongst his intimate friends. One day being invited to a dinner at a farmer general's, he ate a great deal, but did not speak. Rising up from table very early, under pretext of going to the academy, one of Fontaine's company represented to him that it was not yet a proper time: \"Well (says he), if it is not, I will stay a little longer.\" He had one son by his wife in the year 1660. At the age of 14, he put him into the hands of M. de Harley, the first president, recommending to him his education and fortune. It is said, that having been a long time without seeing him, he happened to meet him one day visiting, without recollecting him again, and mentioned to the company that he thought that young man had a good deal of wit and understanding. When they told him it was his own son, he answered in the most tranquil manner, \"Ha! truly I am glad on't.\" An indifference, or rather an absence of mind, influenced his whole conduct, and rendered him often insensible to the inclemency of the weather. Madame de Bouillon going one morning to Verfaillies, saw him, abstracted in thought, sitting in an arbour; returning at night, she found him in the same place, and in the same attitude, although it was very cold, and had rained almost the whole day. He carried this simplicity so far, that he was scarcely sensible of the bad effects some of his writings might occasion, particularly his Tales. In a great sickness, his confessors exhorted him to prayer and alms deeds: \"As for alms deeds (replied Fontaine), I am not able, having nothing to give; but they are about publishing a new edition of my Tales, and the bookeller owes me a hundred copies; you shall have them to sell, and distribute their amount amongst the poor.\" Another time P. Poguet exhorting him to repent of his faults, \"If he has committed any (cried the nurse), I am sure it is more from ignorance than malice, for he has as much simplicity as an infant.\" One time having composed a tale, wherein he made a profane application of those words of the Gospel, \"Lord, five talents thou didst deliver to me,\" he dedicated it, by a most ingenious prologue, to the celebrated Arnauld, telling him, it was to show how to povertify the great esteem he had for the learned doctor. He was not sensible of the indecency of the dedication, and the profane application of the text, till Boileau and Racine represented it to him. He addressed another, by a dedication in the same manner, to the archbishop of Paris. His Fables are an immortal work, exceeding everything in that kind, both ancient and modern, in the opinion of the learned. People of taste, the oftener they read them, will find continually new beauties and charms, not to be met with elsewhere.

Having excited some attention at Paris by certain critical productions, the Abb\u00e9 Bignon in 1724 committed to him the Journal des Savans. He acquitted himself well in this department, and was peaceably enjoying the applause of the public, when his enemies, whom by critical strictures in his Journal he had made such, formed an accusation against him of a most abominable crime, and procured him to be imprisoned. By the credit of powerful friends, he was set at liberty in 15 days: the magistrate of the police took upon himself the trouble of justifying him in a letter to the Abb\u00e9 Bignon; and this letter having been read amidst his fellow labourers in the Journal, he was unanimously re-established in his former credit. This happened in 1725. But with whatever repute he might acquit himself in this Journal, frequent difficulties made him frequently abandon it. He laboured meanwhile in some new periodical works, from which he derived his greatest fame. In 1731, he began one under the title of Nouvelliste du Parnasse, ou R\u00e9flexions sur les Ouvrages nouveaux: but only proceeded to two volumes; the work having been suppressed by authority, from the incessant complaints of authors ridiculed therein. About three years after, in 1735, he obtained a new privilege for a periodical production, entitled, Observations sur les \u00c9crits Modernes; which, after continuing to 33 volumes, was suppressed again in 1743. Yet the year following, 1744, he published another weekly paper, called, Juges sur les Ouvrages nouveaux, and proceeded to 11 volumes: the two last being done by other hands. In 1745, he was attacked with a disorder in the breast, which ended in a dropy that proved fatal in five weeks. \"He was (says M. Freron) born a sentimental person; a philosopher in conduct as well as in principle; exempt from ambition; and of a noble firm spirit, which would not submit to sue for preferments or titles.

He received his education in the college of Jesuits at Rouen, where the quickness of his parts became conspicuous at a very early period. He was capable of writing Latin verses when only 13, which were deemed worthy of being published. He studied the law at the desire of his father; but as he lost the very first cause in which he was employed as an advocate, he became disgusted with his profession, and devoted himself entirely to literature and philosophy. He composed a considerable part of the operas of Pyche and Bellerophon, which were printed under the name of his uncle Thomas Corneille. He wrote a tragedy called Alpar, but as it did not succeed, he consigned the manuscript to the flames, and never afterwards attempted that species of composition. His Dialogues of the dead were published in the year 1683, which were well received, as a specimen of elegant composition, combining morality with the charms of literature. His \"Lettres du Chevalier d'Her,\" published in 1685 without his name, discovered much wit and ingenuity, but at the same time no small share of affectation. His \"Entretiens sur la Pluralit\u00e9 des Mondes\" has been regarded as one of his ablest performances, combining science and philosophy with vivacity and humour, a talent which may be said to belong almost exclusively to the French. It was perused by all, and translated into several foreign languages.\n\nIn his \"History of Oracles,\" he supported the opinion that oracles were forgeries, in opposition to those who contended that they were supernatural operations of evil spirits, put to silence by the appearing of Christ, and of consequence he exposed himself to clerical animadversion. His \"Pastoral Poems\" appeared in the year 1688, with a discourse on the nature of the eclogue, which were very much admired for their delicacy of sentiment, as was also his opera of \"Theis and Peleus;\" but his \"Aeneas and Lavinia\" was not so successful. In the year 1699, Fontanelle was chosen secretary of the Academy of Sciences, which office he held during the long period of 42 years. He published a volume annually of the history of that learned body, filled with analyses of memoirs, and eulogiums on deceased members.\n\nAs a poet, he did not rise above elegance and ingenuity; as a man of science, he rather excelled in throwing light on the inventions of others, than in discovering any new truth himself, and as a general writer, he united solid sense with the delicacy and refinement of a man of wit. He studied his own happiness as much as most men, but he never sacrificed to the promotion of it, the duties of a man of honour and virtue. He had many friends, and towards the close of life, scarcely a single enemy. He was never married, and for a man of letters he acquired considerable affluence. Although of a delicate constitution, he reached the great age of 90 without any complaint but dullness of hearing. He died on the 9th of January 1757, being almost a hundred years of age.

See Botany Index.\n\nFood, in the most extensive signification of the word, implies whatever aliments are taken into the body, whether solid or fluid; but in common language, it is generally used to signify only the solid part of our aliment.\n\nWe are told, that in the first ages men lived upon acorns, berries, and such fruits as the earth spontaneously produces; then they proceeded to eat the flesh of wild animals taken in hunting; But their numbers decreasing and mankind multiplying, necessity taught them the art of cultivating the ground, to sow corn, &c. By and by they began to affix to each other, by general consent, portions of land to produce them their supply of vegetables; after this, reason suggested the expedient of domesticating certain animals, both to assist them in their labours and supply them with food. Hogs were the first animals of the domestic kind that appeared upon their tables; they held it to be ungrateful to devour the beasts that afflicted them in their labours.\u2014When they began to make a free use of domestic animals, they roasted them only: boiling was a refinement in cookery which for ages they were strangers to; and fish living in an element men were unused to, were not eaten till they grew somewhat civilized. Menelaus complains, in the Odyssey, that they had been constrained to feed upon them.\n\nThe most remarkable distinction of foods, in a medical view, is into those which are already assimilated into the animal nature, and such as are not. Of the first kind are animal substances in general; which if not entirely similar, are nearly so, to our nature. The second comprehends vegetables, which are much more difficultly assimilated. But as the nourishment of all animals, even those which live on other animals, can be traced originally to the vegetable kingdom, it is plain, that the principle of all nourishment is in vegetables.\n\nThough there is perhaps no vegetable which does not afford nourishment to some species of animals or other; yet, with regard to mankind, a very considerable distinction is to be made. Those vegetables which are of a mild, bland, agreeable taste, are proper nourishment; while those of an acrid, bitter, and nauseous nature, are improper. We use, indeed, several acid substances as food; but the mild, the bland, and agreeable, are in the largest proportion in almost every vegetable. Such as are very acrid, and at the same time of an aromatic nature, are not used as food, but as spices or condiments, which answer the purposes of medicines rather than any thing else. Sometimes, indeed, acrid and bitter vegetables seem to be admitted as food. Thus celeri and endive are used in common food, though both are substances of considerable acrimony; but it must be observed, that, when we use them, they are previously blanched, which almost totally destroys their acrimony. Or if we employ other acrid substances, we generally, in a great measure, deprive them of their acrimony by boiling. In different countries, the same plants grow with different degrees of acrimony. Thus, garlic here seldom enters our food; but in the southern countries, where the plants grow more mild, they are frequently used for that purpose. The plant which furnishes cayenne, being very acrimonious, and even poisonous, in its recent state, affords an instance of the necessity of preparing acid substances even in the hot countries; and there are other plants, such as arum root, which are so exceedingly acrimonious in their natural state, that they cannot be swallowed with safety; yet, when deprived of that acrimony, will afford good nourishment.\n\nThe most remarkable properties of different vegetable substances as food, are taken notice of under their different names: here we shall only compare vegetable foods in general with those of the animal kind.\n\nI. In the Stomach, they differ remarkably, in that the vegetables always have a tendency to acidity, while animal\nanimal food of all kinds rather tends to alkalescence and putrefaction. Some animal foods, indeed, turn manifestly acid before they putrefy; and it has been asserted, that some degree of acclency takes place in every kind of animal food before digestion. This acclency of animal food, however, never comes to any morbid degree, but the disease is always on the side of putrefaction. The acclency of vegetables is more frequent, and ought to be more attended to, than the alkalescence of animal food; which last, even in weak stomachs, is seldom felt; while acclency greatly affects both the stomach and system.\n\nWith regard to their difference of solution:\u2014Heaviness, as it is called, is seldom felt from vegetables, except from tough farinaceous pastes, or the most viscous substances; while the heaviness of animal food is more frequently noticed, especially when in any great quantity. Difficulty of solution does not depend so much on firmness of texture (as a man, from fills of all kinds, is more oppressed than from firmer substances) as on viscosity; and hence it is more frequent in animal food, especially in the younger animals.\n\nWith regard to mixture:\u2014There is no influence of difficult mixture in vegetables, except in vegetable oils; while animal foods, from both viscosity and oiliness, especially the fatter meats, are refractory in this respect. Perhaps the difference of animal and vegetable foods might be referred to this head of mixture. For vegetable food continues long in the stomach, giving little stimulus: Now the system is affected in proportion to the extent of this stimulus, which is incomparably greater from the animal viscous oily food, than from the vegetable, firmer, and more aqueous. However, there are certain applications to the stomach, which have a tendency to bring on the cold fit of fever, independent of stimulus, merely by their refrigeration: and this often arises from vegetables; as we see, in those hot countries where intermittents prevail, they are often induced from a surfeit of vegetable than of animal food. A proof of this is, that when one is recovering of an intermittent, there is nothing more apt to cause a relapse than cold food, especially if taken on those days when the fit should return, and particularly acclent, fermentable vegetables, as salads, melons, cucumbers, &c., acido-dulces, &c., which, according to Dr Cullen, are the most frequent causes of epidemics; therefore, when an intermittent is to be avoided, we shun vegetable diet, and give animal foods, although their stimulus be greater.\n\nII. In the Intestines. When the putrefaction of animal food has gone too far, it produces an active stimulus, causing diarrhoea, dysentery, &c. But these effects are but rare; whereas from vegetable food and its acid, which, united with the bile, proves a pretty strong stimulus, they more frequently occur; but, luckily, are of less consequence, if the refrigeration is not very great. In the autumnal season, when there is a tendency to dysentery, if it is observed that eating of fruits brings it on, it is rather to be ascribed to their cooling than stimulating the intestines.\n\nAs to stool:\u2014Wherever neither putrefaction nor acidity has gone a great length, animal food keeps the belly more regular. Vegetable food gives a greater proportion of succulent matter, and, when excreted by the stomach and intestines, is more apt to stagnate, and produce slow belly and costiveness, than animal stimulating food; which, before it comes to the great guts, where stoppage is made, has obtained a putrefactive tendency, and gives a proper stimulus: and thus those who are colicive from the use of vegetables; when they have recourse to animal food are in this respect better.\n\nIII. In the blood-vessels. They both give a blood of the same kind, but of different quality. Animal food gives it in greater quantity, being in great part, as the expression is, convertible in succum et sanguinem, and of easy digestion; whereas vegetable is more watery, and contains a portion of unconquerable saline matter, which causes it to be thrown out of the body by some excretion. Animal food affords a more dense stimulating elastic blood than vegetable; stretching and causing a great resistance in the solids, and again exciting their stronger action. It has been supposed that acclency of vegetable food is carried into the blood-vessels, and there exerts its effects; but the tendency of animal fluids is so strong to alkalescence, that the existence of an acid acrimony in the blood seems very improbable. Animal food alone will soon produce an alkalescent acrimony; and if a person who lives entirely on vegetables were to take no food for a few days, his acrimony would be alkalescent.\n\nIV. We are next to take notice of the quantity of nutriment these different foods afford. Nutriment is of two kinds: the first repairs the waste of the solid fibres; the other supplies certain fluids, the chief of which is oil. Now, as animal food is easier converted, and also longer retained in the system, and as it contains a greater proportion of oil, it will afford both kinds of nutriment more copiously than vegetables.\n\nV. Lastly, As to the different degrees of perspirability of these foods. This is not yet properly determined. Sanctius constantly speaks of mutton as the most perspirable of all food, and of vegetables as checking perspiration. This is a consequence of the different stimulus these foods give to the stomach, so that persons who live on vegetables have not their perspiration so suddenly excited. In time of digestion, perspiration is stopped from whatever food, much more so from cooling vegetables. Another reason why vegetables are less perspirable is, because their aqueo-saline juices determine them to go off by urine, while the more perfectly mixed animal food is more equally diffused over the system, and so goes off by perspiration. Hence Sanctius's accounts may be understood; for vegetable aliment is not longer retained in the body, but mostly takes the course of the kidneys. Both are equally perspirable in this respect, viz., that a person living on either returns once a day to his usual weight; and if we consider the little nourishment of vegetables, and the great tendency of animal food to corpulency, we must allow that vegetable is more quickly perspired than animal food.\n\nAs to the question, Whether man was originally designed for animal or vegetable food, see the article CARNIVOROUS.\n\nWith regard to the effects of these foods on men, it must be observed, that there are no persons who live entirely on vegetables. The Pythagoreans themselves ate milk; and those who do so mostly, as the Pythagoreans, are weakly, sickly, and meagre, labouring\ning under a constant diarrhoea and several other difficul-\nties. None of the hardy, robust, live on these; but\nchiefly such as gain a livelihood by the exertion of their\nmental faculties, as (in the East Indies) factors and\nbrokers; and this method of life is now confined to\nthe hot climates, where vegetable diet, without incon-\nvenience, may be carried to great excess. Though it\nbe granted, therefore, that man is intended to live on\nthese different foods promiscuously, yet the vegetable\nshould be in very great proportion. Thus the Lap-\nlanders are said to live entirely on animal food: but\nthis is contradicted by the best accounts; for Linnaeus\nsays, that besides milk, which they take four, to ob-\nviate the bad effects of animal food, they use also cala-\nmenyanthes, and many other plants, copiously. So\nthere is no instance of any nation living entirely either\non vegetable or animal food, though there are indeed\nsome who live particularly on one or other in the greatest\nproportion. In the cold countries, e.g. the inhabi-\ntants live chiefly on animal food, on account of the\nrigour of the season, their smaller perspiration, and little\ntendency to putrefaction.\n\nOf more importance, however, is the following than\nthe former question, viz. In what proportion animal and\nvegetable food ought to be mixed?\n\n1. Animal food certainly gives most strength to\nthe system. It is a known aphorism of Sanctorius,\nthat *pondus addit robur*; which may be explained from\nthe impletion of the blood-vessels, and giving a proper\ndegree of tension for the performance of strong oscil-\nlations. Now animal food not only goes a greater\nway in supplying fluid, but also gives the fluid more\ndense and elastic. The art of giving the utmost strength\nto the system is best understood by those who breed\nfighting cocks. These people raise the cocks to a cer-\ntain weight, which must bear a certain proportion to\nthe other parts of the system, and which at the same\ntime is so nicely proportioned, as that, on losing a few\nounces of it, their strength is very considerably im-\npaired. Dr Robinson of Dublin has observed, that\nthe force and weight of the system ought to be deter-\nmined by the largeness of the heart, and its proportion\nto the system: for a large heart will give large blood-\nvessels, while at the same time the vasa are less, par-\nticularly the liver; which last being increased in size,\na greater quantity of fluid is determined into the cel-\nlular texture, and less into the sanguineous system.\nHence we see how animal food gives strength, by fill-\ning the sanguiferous vessels. What pains we now be-\nlow on cocks, the ancients did on the athlete, by\nproper nourishment bringing them to a great degree of\nstrength and agility. It is said that men were at first\nfed on figs, a proof of which we have from their nu-\ntritious quality; however, in this respect they were\nsoon found to fall far short of animal food; and thus\nwe see, that men, in some measure, will work in pro-\nportion to the quality of their food. The English la-\nbour more than the Scots; and wherever men are ex-\nposed to hard labour, their food should be animal.\u2014\nAnimal food, although it gives strength, yet loads the\nbody; and Hippocrates long ago observed, that the\nathletic habit, by a small increase, was exposed to the\ngreatest hazards. Hence it is only proper for bodily\nlabours, and entirely improper for mental exercises;\nfor whoever would keep his mind acute and penetrat-\ning, will exceed rather on the side of vegetable food.\nEven the body is oppressed with animal food; a full\nmeal always produces dulness, laziness, and yawning;\nand hence the feeding of gamesters, whose mind must\nbe ready to take advantage, is always performed by\navoiding a large quantity of animal food. Farther,\nWith regard to the strength of the body, animal food,\nin the first stage of life, is hardly necessary to give\nstrength: in manhood, when we are exposed to active\nlicences, it is more allowable; and even in the decline\nof life, some proportion of it is necessary to keep the\nbody in vigour. There are some diseases which come\non in the decay of life, at least are aggravated by it;\namong these the most remarkable is the gout. This,\nwhen it is in the system, and does not appear with in-\nflammation in the extremities, has pernicious effects\nthere, attacking the lungs, stomach, head, &c. Now\nto determine this to the extremities, a large proportion\nof animal food is necessary, especially as the person is\ncommonly incapable of much exercise.\n\nAnimal food, although it gives strength, is yet of\nmany hazards to the system, as it produces plethora and\nall its consequences. As a stimulus to the stomach and\nto the whole system, it excites fever, urges the circula-\ntion, and promotes the perspiration. The system,\nhowever, by the repetition of these stimuli, is soon worn\nout; and a man who has early used the athletic diet,\nis either early carried off by inflammatory diseases, or,\nif he takes exercise sufficient to render that diet salutary,\nsuch an accumulation is made of putrefactive fluids, as in\nhis after life lays a foundation for the most inveterate\nchronic distempers. Therefore it is to be questioned,\nwhether we should desire this high degree of bodily\nstrength, with all the inconveniences and dangers at-\ntending it. Those who are chiefly employed in mental\nresearches, and not exposed to too much bodily labour,\nshould always avoid an excess of animal food. There\nis a disease which seems to require animal food, viz.\nthe hysterical, or hypochondriac; and which appears to\nbe very much akin to the gout, affecting the alimentary\ncanal. All people affected with this disease are\nmuch disposed to acephaly; which sometimes goes so\nfar, that no other vegetable but bread can be taken in,\nwithout occasioning the worst consequences. Here then\nwe are obliged to prefer the animal diet, even to those\nof very weak organs; for it generally obviates the\nsymptoms. However, several instances of fever in ex-\ncess have been produced by a long continued use of this\ndiet, which it is always unlucky to be obliged to pre-\nscribe; and when it is absolutely necessary to prescribe,\nit should be joined with as much of the vegetable as\npossible, and when a cure is performed we should gradu-\nally recur to that again.\n\n2. Next, let us consider the vegetable diet. The chief\ninconvenience of this is difficulty of assimilation; which,\nhowever, in the vigorous and exercised, will not be li-\nable to occur. In warm climates, the assimilation of\nvegetable aliment is more easy, so that there it may be\nmore used, and when joined to exercise gives a pretty\ntolerable degree of strength and vigour; and though\nthe general rule be in favour of animal diet, for giving\nstrength, yet there are many instances of its being\nremarkably produced from vegetable. Vegetable diet\nhas this advantage, that it whets the appetite, and that\nwe can hardly suffer from a full meal of it. Besides.\nthe disorders it is liable to produce in the prime via, and its falling short to give strength, there seem to be no bad consequences it can produce in the blood vessels; for there is no influence where its peculiar acrimony was ever carried there, and it is certainly less putrefactive than animal food; nor, without the utmost indolence, and a sharp appetite, does it give plethora, or any of its consequences: so that we cannot here but conclude, that a large proportion of vegetable food is useful for the generality of mankind.\n\nThere is no error in this country more dangerous, or more common, than the neglect of bread; for it is the safest of vegetable aliments, and the best corrector of animal food; and, by a large proportion of this alone, its bad consequences, when used in a hypochondriac state, have been obviated. The French apparently have as much animal food on their tables as the British; and yet, by a greater use of bread and the dried acid fruits, its bad effects are prevented; and therefore bread should be particularly used by the English, as they are so voracious of animal food. Vegetable food is not only necessary to secure health, but long life: and, as we have said, in infancy and youth we should be confined to it mostly; in manhood, and decay of life, use animal food; and, near the end, vegetable again.\n\nThere is another question much agitated, viz. What are the effects of variety in food? Is it necessary and allowable, or universally hurtful? Variety of a certain kind seems necessary; as vegetable and animal foods have their mutual advantages, tending to correct each other. Another variety, which is very proper, is that of liquid and solid food, which should be so managed as to temper each other; and liquid food, especially of the vegetable kind, is too ready to pass off before it is properly assimilated, while solid food makes a long stay. But this does not properly belong to the question, whether variety of the same kind is necessary or proper, as in animal foods, beef, fish, fowl, &c. It doth not appear that there is any inconvenience arising from this mixture or difficulty of assimilation, provided a moderate quantity be taken. When an inconvenience does arise, it probably proceeds from this, that one of the particular substances in the mixture, when taken by itself would produce the same effects; and, indeed, it would appear, that this effect is not heightened by the mixture, but properly obviated by it. There are few exceptions to this, if any, e.g. taking a large proportion of acidulent substances with milk. The coldness, &c. acidity, flatulence, &c. may appear; and it is possible that the coagulum, from the aceticity of the vegetables, being somewhat stronger induced, may give occasion to too long retention in the stomach, and to acidity in too great degree. Again, the mixture of fish and milk often occasions inconveniences. The theory of this is difficult, though, from universal consent, it must certainly be just. Can we suppose that fish gives occasion to such a coagulum as runnet? If it does so, it may produce bad effects. Besides, fishes approach somewhat to vegetables, in giving little stimulus; and are accused of the same bad effects as these, viz. bringing on the cold fit of fever.\n\nThus much may be said for variety. But it also has its disadvantages, provoking to gluttony; this, and the art of cookery, making men take in more than they properly can digest: and hence, perhaps very justly, physicians have universally almost preferred simplicity of diet; for, in spite of rules, man's eating will only be measured by his appetite, and satiety is sooner produced by one than by many substances. But this is so far from being an argument against variety, that it is one for it, as the only way of avoiding a full meal of animal food, and its bad effects, is by presenting a quantity of vegetables. Another mean of preventing the bad effects of animal food, is to take a large proportion of liquid; and hence the bad effects of animal food are less felt in Scotland, on account of their drinking much with it, and using broths, which are at once excellent correctors of animal food and preventives of gluttony.\n\nWith regard to the difference between animal foods, properly so called, the first regards their solubility, depending on a lax or firm texture of their different kinds.\n\nI. Solubility of animal food seems to deserve less attention than is commonly imagined; for there are many instances of persons of a weak stomach incapable of breaking down the texture of vegetables, or even of dissolving a light pudding, to whom hung beef, or a piece of ham, was very grateful and easily digested. None of the theories given for the solution of animal food in the human stomach seem to have explained the process sufficiently. Long ago has been discarded the supposition of an active corrosive menstruum there; and also the doctrine of trituration, for which, indeed, there seems no mechanism in the human body; and, till lately, physicians commonly agreed with Boerhaave in supposing nothing more to be necessary than a watery menstruum, moderate heat, and frequent agitation. This will account for solution in some cases, but not entirely. Let us try to imitate it out of the body with the same circumstances, and in ten times the time in which the food is dissolved in the stomach we shall not be able to bring about the same changes. Take the coagulated white of an egg, which almost every body can easily digest, and yet no artifice shall be able to dissolve it. Hence, then, we are led to seek another cause for solution, viz. fermentation; a notion, indeed, formerly embraced, but on the introduction of mechanical philosophy, industriously banished, with every other supposition of that process taking place at all in the animal economy.\n\nMany of the ancients imagined this fermentation to be putrefactive. But this we deny, as an acid is produced; though hence the fermentation might be reckoned the venous, which, however, seems always to be morbid. Neither, indeed, is the fermentation purely acetous, but modified by putrefaction; for Pringle has observed, that animal matters raise and even expedite the acetous process. The fermentation, then, in the stomach is of a mixed nature, between the acetous and putrefactive, mutually modifying each other; though, indeed, in the intestines, somewhat of the putrefactive seems to take place, as may be observed from the state of the feces broke down, and from the little disposition of such substances to be so, which are not liable to the putrefactive process, as the firmer parts of vegetables, &c. Upon this view solution seems to be extremely easy, and those substances to be most easily broken down which\nFOO\n\nwhich are most subject to putrefaction. See ANATOMY, and GASTRIC JUICE.\n\nBut solution also depends on other circumstances, and hence requires a more particular regard.\n\n1. There is a difference of solubility with respect to the manducation of animal food, for which bread is extremely necessary, in order to keep the more slippery parts in the mouth till they be properly comminuted. From want of proper manducation persons are subject to eruptions; and this more frequently from the firm vegetable foods, as apples, almonds, &c., than from the animal, though, indeed, even from animal food, very tendinous, or swallowed in unbroken masses, such sometimes occur. Manducation is so much connected with solution, that some, from imperfectly performing that, are obliged to belch up their food, remanducate it, and swallow it again before the stomach can dissolve it, or proper nourishment be extracted. Another proof of our regard to solubility, is our rejecting the firmer parts of animal food, as bull beef, and generally carnivorous animals.\n\n2. Its effects with regard to solubility seem also to be the foundation of our choice between fat and lean, young and old meats. In the lean although perhaps a single fibre might be sufficiently tender, yet these, when collected in fasciculi, are very firm and compact, and of difficult solution; whereas in the fat there is a greater number of vessels, a greater quantity of juice, more interposition of cellular substance, and consequently more solubility. Again, in young animals, there is probably the same number of fibres as in the older, but these more connected: whereas, in the older, the growth depending on the separation of these, and the increase of vessels and cellular substance, the texture is less firm and more soluble; which qualities, with regard to the stomach, are at that time too increased, by the increased alkalinity of the animal. To this also may be referred our choice of castrated animals, viz. on account of their disposition to fatten after the operation.\n\n3. It is with a view to the solubility, that we make a choice between meats recently killed, and those which have been kept for some time. As soon as meat is killed, the putrefactive process begins; which commonly we allow to proceed for a little, as that process is the most effectual breaker down of animal matters, and a great afflatus to solution. The length of time during which meat ought to be kept, is proportioned to the meat's tendency to undergo the putrid fermentation, and the degree of those circumstances which favour it: Thus, in the torrid zone, where meat cannot be kept above four or five hours, it is used much more recent than in these northern climates.\n\n4. Boiled or roasted meats create a difference of solution. By boiling we extract the juices interposed between the fibres, approximate them more to each other, and render them of more difficult solubility; which is increased too by the extraction of the juices, which are much more alkaline than the fibres: but when we want to avoid the stimulus of alkaline food, and the quick solution, as in some cases of disease, the roasted is not to be chosen. Of roasted meat it may be asked, which are more proper, those which are moist or least roasted? That which is least done is certainly the most soluble: even raw meats are more soluble than dressed, as Dr Cullen was informed by a person who from necessity was obliged, for some time, to eat such. But at the same time that meats little done are very soluble, they are very alkaline; so that, wherever we want to avoid alkalinity in the prime use, the most roasted meats should be chosen. Those who throw away the broths of boiled meat do very improperly; for, besides their supplying a fluid, from their greater alkalinity they increase the solubility of the meat. Here we shall observe, that pure blood has been thought insoluble. Undoubtedly it is very nutritious; and though out of the body, like the white of eggs, it seems very insoluble, yet, like that too, in the body it is commonly easily digested. Moses very properly forbade it the Israelites, as in warm countries it is highly alkaline; and even here, when it was used in great quantity, the scurvy was more frequent: but to a moderate use of it, in these climates, no such objection takes place.\n\n5. Solubility is varied from another source, viz. viscosity of the juice of aliment. Young animals, then, appear more soluble than old, not only on account of the compaction and firmness of texture in the latter, but also their greater viscosity of juice. And nothing is more common, than to be longer oppressed from a full meal of veal, than from the same quantity of beef, &c. Upon account, too, of their greater viscosity of juice, are the tendinous and ligamentous parts of animals longer retained than the purely muscular, as well as on account of their firmness of texture. Even fishes, whose muscular parts are exceedingly tender, are, on account of their gluey viscosity, longer of solution in the stomach. And eggs, too, which are exceedingly nourishing, have the same effect, and cannot be taken in great quantity: For the stomach is peculiarly sensitive to gelatinous substances; and by this means has nature perhaps taught us, as it were by a sort of instinct, to limit ourselves in the quantity of such nutritive substances.\n\n6. With regard to solution, we must take in the oils of animal food; which, when tolerably pure, are the least putrefactive part of it, and, by diminishing the cohesion of the fibres, render them more soluble. On this last account is the lean of fat meat more easily dissolved than other lean. But when the meat is exposed to much heat, this oil is separated, leaving the solid parts less easily soluble, and becoming itself empyreumatic, rancid, and of difficult mixture in the stomach. Fried meats, from the reasons now given, and baked meats, for the same, as well as for the tenacity of the paste, are preparations which diminish the solubility of the food. From what has been said, the preparation of food by fattening it, and keeping it for some time after being killed, although it may administer to gluttony, will yet, it must be confessed, increase the solution of the food.\n\nII. The second difference of animal food is with regard to ALKALINEGENCY.\n\nOf this we have taken a little notice already under the head of Solubility.\n\n1. From their too great alkalinity we commonly avoid the carnivorous animals, and the fer\u00e6; and choose rather the granivorous. Some birds, indeed, which live on insects, are admitted into our food; but\nno man, without nausea, can live upon these alone for any length of time. Fishes, too, are an exception to this rule, living almost universally on each other. But in these the alkaline deficiency does not proceed so far; whether from the viscosity of their juice, their want of heat, or some peculiarity in their economy, is not easy to determine.\n\n2. Alkaline deficiency is determined by difference of age. The older animals are always more alkaline than the young, from their continual progress to putrefaction. Homberg always found, in his endeavors to extract an acid from human blood, that more was obtained from the young than from the old animals.\n\n3. A third circumstance which varies the alkaline deficiency of the food, is the wildness or tameness of the animal; and this again seems to depend on its exercise. Dr Cullen knew a gentleman who was fond of cats for food; but he always used to feed them on vegetable food, and kept them from exercise; and in the same manner did the Romans rear up their rats, when intended for food. In the same way the flesh of the partridge and the hen seems to be much the same; only, from its being more on the wing, the one is more alkaline than the other. Again, Tame animals are commonly used without their blood; whereas the wild are commonly killed in their blood, and upon that account, as well as their greater exercise, are more alkaline.\n\n4. The alkaline deficiency of food may be determined from the quantity of volatile salt it affords. The older the meat is, it is found to give the greater proportion of volatile salt.\n\n5. The alkaline deficiency of aliment may also, in some measure, be determined from its colour, the younger animals being whiter and less alkaline. We also take a mark from the colour of the gravy poured out, according to the redness of the juices judging of the animal's alkaline deficiency.\n\n6. The relish of food is found to depend much on its alkaline deficiency, as does also the stimulus it gives and the fever it produces in the system. These effects are also complicated with the viscosity of the food, by which means it is longer detained in the stomach, and the want of alkaline deficiency supplied.\n\nHaving mentioned animal food as differing in solubility and alkaline deficiency, which often go together in the same subject, we come to the third difference, viz.\n\nIII. Quantity of Nutrient. Which is either absolute or relative; absolute with respect to the quantity it really contains, sufficient powers being given to extract it; relative, with respect to the assimilatory powers of those who use it. The absolute nutrient is of some consequence; but the relative, in the robust and healthy, and except in cases of extraordinary weakness, may, without much inconvenience, be disregarded. In another case is the quantity of nourishment relative, viz. with regard to its perspiration; for if the food is soon carried off by the excretions, it is the same thing as if it contained a less proportion of nourishment. For, giving more fluid, that which is longer retained affords most; and, for the repair of the solids, that retention also is of advantage. Now, gelatinous substances are long retained; and besides, are themselves animal substances dissolved: so that, both absolutely and relatively, such substances are nutritious. Of this kind are eggs, shell fish, &c. In adults, though it is disputed whether their solids need any repair, yet at any rate, at this period, fluid is more required; for this purpose the alkaline foods are most proper, being most easily dissolved. They are, at the same time, the most perishable; on one hand that alkaline deficiency leading to disease, while on the other their perishability obviates it. Adults, therefore, as writers justly observe, are better nourished on the alkaline; the young and growing, on gelatinous foods. All this leads to a comparison of young and old meats; the first being more gelatinous, and the last more alkaline. This, however, by experience, is not yet properly ascertained. Mr Geoffroy is the only person who has been taken up with the analysis of foods. See Memoires de l'Academie, Pan. 1731 & 1732. His attempt was certainly laudable, and in some respects usefully performed; but, in general, his experiments were not sufficiently repeated, nor are indeed sufficiently accurate. He has not been on his guard against the various circumstances which affect meats; the cow-kind liking a moist succulent herbage, which is not to be got in warm climates; while the sheep are fond of dry food, and thrive best there. Again, Some of his experiments seem contradictory. He says, that veal gives more solution than beef, while lamb gives less than mutton, which is much to be doubted. If both he and Sanctorius had examined English beef, the result probably would have been very different as to its perspiration, &c. Besides, Mr Geoffroy has only analyzed beef and veal when raw; has made no proper circumstantial comparisons between quadrupeds and birds; and has examined these last along with their bones, and not their muscles, &c. by themselves, as he ought to have done, &c. If a set of experiments of this kind were properly and accurately performed, they might be of great use; but at present, for the purpose of determining our present subject, we must have recourse to our alkaline, solubility, &c.\n\nIV. The fourth difference of animal food is, The Nature of the Fluids they afford. The whole of this will be understood from what has been said on alkaline deficiency; the fluid produced being more or less dense and stimulating, in proportion as that prevails.\n\nV. The fifth difference of animal foods is with respect to their\n\nPerspiration. The sum of what can be said on this matter is this, that such foods as promote an accumulation of fluid in our vessels and dispose to plethora, are the least perishable, and commonly give most strength; that the more alkaline foods are the most perishable, though the viscid and less alkaline may attain the same property by long retention in the system. The authors on perspiration have determined the perspiration of foods as imperfectly as Mr Geoffroy has done the solubility, and in a few cases only. We must not lay hold on what Sanctorius has said on the perspiration of mutton, because he has not examined in the same way other meats in their perfect state; far less on what Keil says of oysters, as he himself was a valetudinarian, and consequently an unfit subject for such experiments, and probably of a peculiar temperament.\n\nAs to the effects of Food on the Mind, we have already hinted at them above. It is plain, that deli-\ncacy of feeling, liveliness of imagination, quickness of apprehension, and acuteness of judgment, more frequently accompany a weak state of the body. True it is indeed, that the same state is liable to timidity, fluctuation and doubt; while the strong have that steadiness of judgment, and firmness of purpose, which are proper for the higher and more active scenes of life. The most valuable state of the mind, however, appears to reside in somewhat less firmness and vigour of body. Vegetable aliment, as never over-stimulating the vessels or loading the system, never interrupts the stronger motions of the mind; while the heat, fulness, and weight, of animal food, are an enemy to its vigorous efforts. Temperance, then, does not so much consist in the quantity, for that always will be regulated by our appetite, as in the quality, viz., a large proportion of vegetable aliment.\n\nA considerable change has now taken place in the articles made use of as food by the ancients, by substituting, instead of what were then used, particularly of the vegetable kind, a number of more bland, agreeable, and nutritive juices. The acorns and nuts of the primitive times have given way to a variety of sweeter farinaceous seeds and roots. To the malvaceous tribe of plants so much used by the Greeks and Romans, hath succeeded the more grateful spinach; and to the bitter, the garden orach. The rough borage is supplanted by the excellent sorrel; and asparagus has banished a number of roots recorded by the Roman writers under the name of bulbis; but Linnaeus is of opinion, that the parsnip has undeservedly usurped the place of the skirret. The bean of the ancients, improperly so called, being the roots as well as other parts of the nymphaea melumbo, or Indian water-lily, is superseded by the kidney bean. The garden rocket, eaten with and as an antidote against the chilling qualities of the lettuce, is banished by the more agreeable cress and tarragon; the apium by the meliorated celery; the pompion, and others of the cucurbitaceous tribe, by the melon; and the fennel berries, by the fragrant nutmeg. The filipium, or succus Cyrenaicus, which the Romans purchased from Persia and India at a great price, and is thought by some to have been the affaecida of the present time, is no longer used in preference to the alliaceous tribe.\n\nTo turn from the vegetable to some of the animal substitutes, we may mention the carp among fishes as having excluded a great number held in high estimation among the Romans; the change of oil for butter; of honey for sugar; of mulfa, or liquors made of wine, water, and honey, for the wines of modern times; and that of the ancient zythus for the present improved malt liquors; not to mention also the Callida of the Roman taverns, analogous to our tea and coffee.\n\nFood of Plants.

It is low and sandy in the southern part, but the north rises in a black hill of inconsiderable height. It is covered with a kind of bent grass, which never arises at any great length by reason of want of rain and the constant browsing of the goats. There are great appearances of the black hill having once been a volcano; and near the north cape the ground sounds hollow like the Solfatara in Italy. There are a vast number of beautiful fish met with upon the coasts, but few fit for eating; and our traveller observed, that the most beautiful were the most noxious when eaten; none indeed, being salutary food excepting those which resembled the fish of the northern seas. There are many beautiful shell-fish, as the concha veneris, of several colours and sizes; sea urchins, &c. Sponges are likewise found all along the coast. There are also pearls, but neither large nor of a good-water; in consequence of which they sell at no great price. They are produced by a species of bivalve shells. Several large shells, from the fish named biffer, are met with upon stones of ten or twelve tons weight along the coast.

His father was member of parliament for Tiverton, in Devonshire, and enjoyed the post of commissioner of the prize office and fine-contrat. His mother was heiress of the Dinley and Goodere families. In consequence of a fatal misunderstanding between her two brothers, Sir John Dinley Goodere, Bart. and Samuel Goodere, Esq. captain of his majesty's ship the Ruby, which ended in the death of both, a considerable part of the Goodere estate, which was better than 5000l. per annum, descended to Mr Foote.\n\nHe was educated at Worcester college, Oxford, which owed its foundation to Sir Thomas Cookes Winford, Bart. a second cousin of our author's. On leaving the university, he commenced student of law in the Temple; but as the dryness of this study did not suit the liveliness of his genius, he soon relinquished it. He married a young lady of a good family and some fortune; but their tempers not agreeing, a perfect harmony did not long subsist between them. He now launched into all the fashionable foibles of the age, gaming not excepted, and in a few years spent his whole fortune. His necessities led him to the stage, and he made his first appearance in the character of Othello. He next performed Pendlewife with much more applause; and this, indeed, was ever after one of his capital parts. He attempted Lord Foppington likewise, but prudently gave it up. But as Mr Foote was never a capital actor in the plays of others, his salary was very unequal to his gay and extravagant turn; and he contracted debts which forced him to take refuge within the verge of the court. On this occasion, he relieved his necessities by the following stratagem. Sir Fr\u2014s D\u2014l\u2014l had long been his intimate friend, and had dissipated his fortune by similar extravagance. Lady N\u2014n\u2014P\u2014let, who was likewise an intimate acquaintance of Foote's, and who was exceedingly rich, was fortunately at that time bent upon a matrimonial scheme. Foote strongly recommended to her to consult upon this momentous affair the conjurer in the Old Bailey, whom he represented as a man of surprising skill and penetration. He employed an acquaintance of his own to perforate the conjurer; who depicted Sir Fr\u2014s D\u2014l\u2014l at full length; described the time when, the place where, and the dress in which she would see him. The lady was so struck with the coincidence of every circumstance, that she married D\u2014l\u2014l in a few days. For this service Sir Francis settled an annuity upon Foote; and this enabled him once more to emerge from obscurity.\n\nIn 1747 he opened the little theatre in the Haymarket, taking upon himself the double character of author and performer; and appeared in a dramatic piece of his own composition, called the Divertions of the Morning. This piece consisted of nothing more than the exhibition of several characters well known in real life; whose manner of conversation and expression this author very happily hit off in the diction of his drama, and still more happily represented on the stage, by an exact and most amazing imitation, not only of the manner and tone of voice, but even of the very persons, of those whom he intended to take off. In this performance, a certain physician, Dr L\u2014n, well known for the oddity and singularity of his appearance and conversation, and the celebrated Chevalier Taylor, who was at that time in the height of his popularity, were made objects of Foote's ridicule; the latter, indeed, very deservedly; and, in the concluding part of his speech, under the character of a theatrical director, Mr Foote took off, with great humour and accuracy, the several styles of acting of every principal performer on the English stage. This performance at first met with some opposition from the civil magistrates of Westminster, under the sanction of the act of parliament for limiting the number of playhouses, as well as from the jealousy of one of the managers of Drury-lane playhouse; but the author being patronized by many of the principal nobility, and other persons of distinction, this opposition was overruled; and having altered the title of his performance, Mr Foote proceeded, without further molestation, to give Tea in a Morning to his friends, and represented it through a run of 40 mornings to crowded and splendid audiences.\u2014The ensuing season he produced another piece of the same kind, which he called An Auction of Pictures. In this performance he introduced several new and popular characters; particularly Sir Thomas de Veil, then the acting justice of peace for Westminster, Mr Cock the celebrated auctioneer, and the equally famous Orator Henley. This piece also had a very great run.\u2014His Knights, which was the produce of the ensuing season, was a performance of somewhat more dramatic regularity: but still, although his plot and characters seemed less immediately personal, it was apparent that he kept some particular real persons strongly in his eye in the performance; and the town took upon themselves to fix them where the resemblance appeared to be the most striking. Thus Mr Foote continued from time to time to select, for the entertainment of the public, such characters, as well general as individual, as seemed most likely to engage their attention. His dramatic pieces, exclusive of the interlude called Piety in Patterns, are as follow: Taste, the Knights, The Author, The Englishman in Paris, The Englishman returned from Paris, The Mayor of Garrat, The Liar, The Patron, The Minor, The Orators, The Commissary,\nCommissary, The Devil upon Two Sticks, The Lame Lover, The Maid of Bath, The Nabob, The Cozeners, The Capuchin, The Bankrupt, and an unfinished comedy called The Slanderer. All these works are only to be ranked among the petticoat pieces of the theatre. In the execution they are somewhat loose, negligent, and unfinished; the plots are often irregular, and the catastrophes not always conclusive: but, with all these deficiencies, they contain more strength of character, more strokes of keen satire, and more touches of temporary humour, than are to be found in the writings of any other modern dramatist. Even the language spoken by his characters, incorrect as it may sometimes seem, will on a closer examination be found entirely dramatical; as it abounds with those natural minute of expression which frequently form the very basis of character, and which render it the truest mirror of the conversation of the times in which he wrote.\n\nIn the year 1766, being on a party of pleasure with the late duke of York, Lord Mexborough, and Sir Francis Delaval, Mr Foote had the misfortune to break his leg, by a fall from his horse; in consequence of which, he was compelled to undergo an amputation. This accident so sensibly affected the duke, that he made a point of obtaining for Mr Foote a patent for life; whereby he was allowed to perform, at the little theatre in the Haymarket, from the 15th of May to the 15th of September every year.\n\nHe now became a greater favourite of the town than ever: his very laughable pieces, with his more laughable performance, constantly filled his house; and his receipts were some seasons almost incredible. Parsimony was never a vice to be ascribed to Mr Foote; his hospitality and generosity were ever conspicuous; he was visited by the first nobility, and he was sometimes honoured even by royal guests.\n\nThe attack made upon his character by one of his domestics, whom he had dismissed for misbehaviour, is too well known to be particularized here. Suffice it to say, he was honourably acquitted of that charge: but it is believed by some, that the shock which he received from it accelerated his death; others pretend, that his literary altercation with a certain then duchess, or rather her agents, much affected him, and that from that time his health declined. It is probable, however, that his natural volatility of spirits could scarcely fail to support him against all impressions from either of these quarters.\n\nMr Foote, finding his health decline, entered into an agreement with Mr Colman, for his patent of the theatre; according to which, he was to receive from Mr Colman, \u00a3600 per annum, besides a stipulated sum whenever he chose to perform. Mr Foote made his appearance two or three times in some of the most admired characters; but, being suddenly affected with a paralytic stroke one night whilst upon the stage, he was compelled to retire. He was advised to bathe; and accordingly repaired to Brighthelmstone, where he apparently recovered his former health and spirits, and was what is called the fiddle of the company who resorted to that agreeable place of amusement. A few weeks before his death, he returned to London; but, by the advice of his physicians, set out with an intention to spend the winter at Paris and in the south of France. He had got no farther than Dover, when he was suddenly attacked by another stroke of the palsy, which in a few hours terminated his existence. He died on the 21st of October 1777, in the 56th year of his age, and was privately interred in the cloisters of Westminster abbey.","sp":423,"ep":424},{"h":"FORAMEN","t":"in Anatomy, a name given to several apertures or perforations in divers parts of the body; as, 1.

In his early life, he was brought up in a family remarkable for hospitality; which, perhaps, led him afterwards to a freer indulgence in social pleasures. His natural disposition inclined him to the army; but, as he soon discovered a superior genius, by the advice of his friends he applied himself to letters. He directed his studies particularly to the civil law; in which he made a quick progress, and in 1709 was admitted an advocate. From 1722 to 1737, he represented in parliament the boroughs of Inverness, Fortrose, Nairn, and Forres. In 1725, he was made king's advocate; and lord president of the court of session in 1737. In the rebellions which broke out in Scotland in 1715 and 1745 he espoused the royal cause; but with so much prudence and moderation did he conduct himself at this delicate conjuncture, that not a whisper was at any time heard to his prejudice. The glory he acquired in advancing the prosperity of his country, and in contributing to re-establish peace and order, was the only reward of his services. He had even impaired, and almost ruined, his private fortune in the cause of the public: but government did not make him the smallest recompense. The minister, with a meanness for which it is difficult to account, desired to have a state of his disbursements. Shocked at the incivility and rudeness of this treatment, he left the minister without making any reply. Throughout the whole course of his life he had a lively sense of religion, without the least taint of superstition; and his charity was extended to every sect and denomination of religionists indiscriminately. He was well versed in the Hebrew language; and wrote in a flowing and oratorical style, concerning religion natural and revealed, some important discoveries in theology and philosophy, and concerning the sources of incredulity. He died in 1747, in the 62nd year of his age; and his works have since been published in two volumes octavo.","sp":424,"ep":424},{"h":"FORCE","t":"in Philosophy, denotes the cause of the change.\nchange in the state of a body, when, being at rest, it begins to move, or has a motion which is either not uniform or not direct. While a body remains in the same state, either of rest or of uniform and rectilinear motion, the cause of its remaining in such a state is in the nature of the body, and it cannot be said that any extrinsic force has acted on it. This internal cause or principle is called inertia.\n\nMechanical forces may be reduced to two sorts: one of a body at rest, the other of a body in motion.\n\nThe force of a body at rest, is that which we conceive to be in a body lying still on a table, or hanging by a rope, or supported by a spring, &c. and this is called by the names of preflure, tension, force, or vis mortua, solicitatio, conatus movendi, conamen, &c. To this class also of forces we must refer centripetal and centrifugal forces, though they reside in a body in motion; because these forces are homogeneous to weights, preflures, or tensions of any kind.\n\nThe force of a body in motion is a power residing in that body so long as it continues its motion; by means of which it is able to remove obstacles lying in its way; to lessen, destroy, or overcome the force of any other moving body which meets it in an opposite direction; or to surmount any dead preflure or resistance, as tensity, gravity, friction, &c. for some time; but which will be lessened or destroyed by such resistance as lessens or destroys the motion of the body. This is called moving force, vis motrix, and by some late writers vis viva, to distinguish it from the vis mortua spoken of before; and by these appellations, however different, the same thing is understood by all mathematicians; namely, that power of displacing, of withstanding opposite moving forces, or of overcoming any dead resistance, which resides in a moving body, and which, in whole or in part, continues to accompany it, so long as the body moves. See Mechanics.\n\nWe have several curious as well as useful observations in Defaguliers's Experimental Philosophy, concerning the comparative forces of men and horses, and the best way of applying them. A horse draws with the greatest advantage when the line of direction is level with his breast; in such a situation, he is able to draw 200lb. eight hours a-day, walking about two miles and a half an hour. And if the same horse is made to draw 240lb., he can work but six hours a-day, and cannot go quite so fast. On a carriage, indeed where friction alone is to be overcome, a middling horse will draw 1000lb. But the best way to try a horse's force, is by making him draw up out of a well, over a single pulley or roller; and, in such a case, one horse with another will draw 200lb. as already observed.\n\nFive men are found to be equal in strength to one horse, and can, with as much ease, push round the horizontal beam of a mill, in a walk 40 feet wide; whereas three men will do it in a walk only 19 feet wide.\n\nThe worst way of applying the force of a horse, is to make him carry or draw up hill: for if the hill be steep, three men will do more than a horse, each man climbing up faster with a burden of 100lb. weight, than a horse that is loaded with 300lb.; a difference which is owing to the position of the parts of the human body being better adapted to climb than those of a horse.\n\nOn the other hand, the best way of applying the force of a horse, is in a horizontal direction, wherein a man can exert least force; thus a man weighing 140lb. and drawing a boat along by means of a rope coming over his shoulders, cannot draw above 27lb. or exert above one seventh part of the force of a horse employed to the same purpose.\n\nThe very best and most effectual posture in a man, is that of rowing, in which he not only acts with more muscles at once for overcoming the resistance, than in any other position; but as he pulls backward, the weight of his body assists by way of lever. See Defaguliers, Exp. Phil. vol. i. p. 241, where we have several other observations relative to force acquired by certain positions of the body, from which that author accounts for most feats of strength and activity. See also Memoire on this subject by M. de la Hire, in Mem. Roy. Acad. Sc. 1629; or in Defaguliers, Exp. &c. 267, &c. who has published a translation of part of it, with remarks.\n\nCitizen Regnier has invented an instrument for ascertaining the relative strength of men and animals, for an account of which, see Dynamometer; and for a fuller description of the apparatus, the reader may consult the original paper on the subject in Journal de l'Ecole Polytechn., vol. ii. or the translation in Phil. Mag. vol. i.\n\nForce, in Law, signifies any unlawful violence offered to things or persons, and is divided into simple and compound. Simple force is what is so committed, that it has no other crime attending it; as where a person by force enters another's possession, without committing any other unlawful act. Compound force, is where some other violence is committed, with such an act which of itself alone is criminal; as if one enters by force into another's house, and there kills a person, or ravishes a woman. There is likewise a force implied in law, as in every trepans, rescue, or distress, and an actual force with weapons, number of persons, &c.\u2014Any person may lawfully enter a tavern, inn, or victualling house; so may a landlord his tenant's house to view repairs, &c.

But this liberty being abused, to the breach of the peace, it was therefore found necessary that the same should be restrained: Though, at this day, he\nwho is wrongfully dispossessed of goods may by force retake them. By statute, no persons shall make an entry on any lands or tenements, except where it is given by law, and in a peaceable manner; even though they have title of entry, on pain of imprisonment: and where a forcible entry is committed, justices of peace are authorized to view the place, and inquire of the force by a jury, summoned by the sheriff of the county; and they may cause the tenements, &c., to be restored, and imprison the offenders till they pay a fine. Likewise a writ of forcible entry lies, where a person seised of freehold, is by force put out thereof.\n\n**Forcible Marriage**, of a woman of estate, is felony. For by the statute 3 H. VII. c. 2, it is enacted, \"That if any persons shall take away any woman having lands or goods, or that is heir apparent to her ancestor, by force, and against her will, and marry or defile her; the takers, procurers, abettors, and receivers, of the woman taken away against her will, and knowing the same, shall be deemed principal felons; but as to procurers and accessories before the fact, they are to be excluded the benefit of clergy, by 39 Elizabeth c. 9. The indictment on the statute H. VII. is expressly set forth, that the woman taken away had lands or goods, or was heir apparent; and also that she was married or defiled, because no other case is within the statute; and it ought to allege that the taking was for lucre. It is no excuse that the woman at first was taken away with her consent: for if she afterwards refuse to continue with the offender, and be forced against her will, she may from that time properly be said to be taken against her will; and it is not material whether a woman so taken away be at last married or defiled with her own consent or not, if she were under force at the time; the offender being in both cases equally within the words of the act.\n\nThose persons who, after the fact, receive the offender, are but accessories after the offence, according to the rules of common law; and those that are only privy to the damage, but not parties to the forcible taking away, are not within the act, H. P. C. 119. A man may be indicted for taking away a woman by force in another country; for the continuing of the force in any country, amounts to a forcible taking there. Ibid. Taking away any woman-child under the age of 16 years and unmarried, out of the custody and without the consent of the father or guardian, &c., the offender shall suffer fine and imprisonment; and if the woman agrees to any contract of matrimony with such person, she shall forfeit her estate during life, to the next of kin, to whom the inheritance should descend, &c. Stat. 4 & 5, P. & M. c. 8. This is a force against the parents: and an information will lie for forcing a young man or woman from their parents, against their consents, in order to marry them, &c.

See Gardening Index.\n\nForcing, in the wine trade, a term used by the wine coopers for the fining down wines, and rendering them fit for immediate draught. The principal inconvenience of the common way of fining down the white wines with isinglass, and the red with whites of eggs, is the slowness of the operation; these ingredients not performing their office in less than a week, or sometimes a fortnight, according as the weather proves favourable, cloudy or clear, windy or calm: this appears to be matter of constant observation. But the wine merchant frequently requires a method that shall, with certainty, make the wines fit for taffing in a few hours. A method of this kind there is, but it is kept in a few hands a valuable secret. Perhaps it depends upon a prudent use of a tartarized spirit of wine, and the common forcing, as occasion is, along with gypsum, as the principal; all which are to be well stirred about in the wine, for half an hour before it is suffered to rest.\n\n**Fordoun**, John of, the father of Scottish history, flourished in the reign of Alexander III., towards the end of the 13th century. But of his life there is nothing known with certainty, though there was not a monastery that possessed not copies of his work.

Therefore, \\( \\frac{\\dot{u}}{\\dot{x}} = 4x^3 \\) and \\( \\dot{u} = 4x^3 \\dot{x} \\).\n\nTo resolve the problem generally, or when \\( u = x^n \\), let us suppose \\( x \\) to become \\( x + h \\), and \\( u \\) to become \\( u' \\), then \\( u' = (x + h)^n \\). But this last quantity, when expanded into a series by the binomial theorem (Algebra, Sect. XVII.) is\n\n\\[\n(x + h)^n = p + ph + qh^2 + rh^3 + &c.,\n\\]\n\nor \\( u + ph + qh^2 + rh^3 + &c. \\),\n\nwhere \\( p, q, r, &c. \\) denote functions of \\( x \\), independent of \\( h \\). Therefore,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{u' - u}{h} = p + ph + qh^2 + rh^3 + &c.,\n\\]\n\nand \\( \\frac{\\dot{u}}{\\dot{x}} = p + ph + qh^2 + rh^3 + &c. \\)\n\nTherefore, supposing \\( h \\) to be continually diminished, the limit of \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\) is \\( p \\); but, whatever be the nature of the exponent \\( n \\), \\( p \\) is always \\( nx^{n-1} \\) (Algebra, \u00a7 267.), therefore, the limit of \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\) is \\( nx^{n-1} \\), and consequently \\( \\frac{\\dot{u}}{\\dot{x}} = nx^{n-1} \\), and \\( \\dot{u} = nx^{n-1} \\dot{x} \\).\n\n26. As we shall have frequently occasion to employ the result of this investigation, it will be proper to express it in the form of a practical rule, thus:\n\nTo find the fluxion of any power of a variable quantity. Multiply the fluxion of the variable quantity itself by the exponent of the power, and by a power of the quantity whose exponent is less by unity than the given exponent, and the product will be the fluxion required.\n\n(b) We are here to be understood to mean the ratio of the numerical values of the increments, which may always be compared with each other, whether the variable quantities be of the same kind, as both lines, or both surfaces, &c., or of different kinds, as the one a line, and the other a surface.\n27. In determining the limit of the ratio of the simultaneous increments of \\( x \\) and \\( x^n \\), we have referred to the binomial theorem, but the only application we have had occasion to make of that theorem was to determine the numeral coefficient of the second term of the development of \\((x + h)^n\\), when \\( n \\) is supposed to be any number whatever, which is an inquiry of a more simple nature than the general investigation of the theorem. We shall now show how that coefficient may be deduced from the first principles of algebra. Thus the investigation of the fluxion of \\( x^n \\) will be rendered independent of the general demonstration of the binomial theorem; and we shall hereafter show that the theorem itself is easily investigated by the direct method of fluxions.\n\n28. Since \\( x + h \\) is equal to \\( x(1 + \\frac{h}{x}) \\) it follows that \\((x + h)^n = x^n (1 + \\frac{h}{x})^n\\), thus the development of \\((x + h)^n\\) is reduced to that of \\((1 + \\frac{h}{x})^n\\), or putting \\( \\frac{h}{x} = v \\), to \\((1 + v)^n\\). Now if we give particular values to \\( n \\), and suppose it to be 1, 2, 3, &c. or \u20141, \u20142, &c. or lastly \\( \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\) &c. we can find the series that expresses the powers of \\( 1 + v \\), whose exponents are those numbers, by the operations of multiplication, division, and evolution, and in every particular case we shall find, that the powers of \\( 1 + v \\) are expressed by a series of this form,\n\n\\[ 1 + A v + B v^2 + C v^3 + D v^4 + &c. \\]\n\nWhere \\( A, B, C, D, \\) &c. denote numeral coefficients which depend for their value only on \\( n \\) the exponent of the power, and not on the quantity \\( v \\); and as the form of the series will be found to be the same whatever particular values we may give to the exponent, we may conclude that it is the same, whether the exponent be positive or negative, whole or fractional.\n\n29. First let us suppose that the exponent is a whole positive number, then, because\n\n\\[ (1 + v)^n = 1 + A v + B v^2 + &c. \\]\n\nif we multiply both sides of this equation by \\( 1 + v \\), and collect together the like powers of \\( v \\), it will appear that\n\n\\[ (1 + v)^{n+1} = 1 + A' v + B' v^2 + &c. \\]\n\nHence it appears that the coefficient of the second term of any power of \\( 1 + v \\) exceeds that of the next less power by unity. Now in the case of the first power of \\( 1 + v \\), the coefficient of the second term is obviously 1, therefore, in the second power it is 2, in the third power 3, and universally, in the \\( n \\)th power it is \\( n \\); so that \\( n \\) being a whole positive number,\n\n\\[ (1 + v)^n = 1 + n v + &c. \\]\n\n30. Let us next suppose the exponent to be a fraction denoted by \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\), so that\n\n\\[ (1 + v)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = 1 + A v + B v^2 + &c. \\]\n\nLet both sides of this equation be raised to the power \\( n \\), having first substituted \\( M v \\) for \\( A v + B v^2 + &c. \\), then\n\n\\[ (1 + v)^m = (1 + M v)^n. \\]\n\nNow as we have just found that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) being integers,\n\n\\[ (1 + v)^m = 1 + m v + &c. \\]\nand \\((1 + M v)^n = 1 + n M v + &c.\\)\n\nHere we stop at the second term, that being the only one whose coefficient is required. Substitute now for \\( M v \\) its value \\( A v + &c. \\), then, stopping again at the second term, we get\n\n\\[ (1 + M v)^n = 1 + n A v + &c. \\]\n\ntherefore,\n\n\\[ 1 + m v + &c. = 1 + n A v + &c. \\]\n\nand making the coefficients of \\( v \\) in each series equal to each other,\n\n\\[ n A = m, \\text{ and } A = \\frac{m}{n}. \\]\n\n31. In the last place let us suppose that the exponent is a negative quantity either whole or fractional, so that\n\n\\[ (1 + v)^{-\\frac{m}{n}} = 1 + A' v + B' v^2 + &c. \\]\n\nor\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{(1 + v)^{\\frac{m}{n}}} = 1 + A' v + B' v^2 + &c. \\]\n\nthen, multiplying both sides by \\((1 + v)^{\\frac{m}{n}}\\) we get\n\n\\[ 1 = (1 + v)^{\\frac{m}{n}}(1 + A' v + B' v^2 + &c.) \\]\n\nor, substituting \\( 1 + A v + B v^2 + &c. \\) for \\((1 + v)^{\\frac{m}{n}}\\) and actually multiplying the two series,\n\n\\[ 1 = 1 + A \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{c} v \\\\ + A' \\end{array} \\right\\} v + B \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{c} v^2 \\\\ + A' \\end{array} \\right\\} v^2 + &c. \\]\n\nNow that this equation may subsist, whatever be the value of \\( v \\), it is necessary that\n\n\\[ A + A' = 0, \\]\n\\[ B + A' + B' = 0, \\]\n&c.\n\nand by these equations we may determine \\( A', B', C', \\) &c. It is however only required at present to find the first of these, viz \\( A' \\); now we have \\( A' = -A \\); but \\( A \\) being the coefficient of the second term of the series expressing \\((1 + v)^{\\frac{m}{n}}\\), the exponent of which is positive, we have already found it to be \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\), therefore, \\( A' = -\\frac{m}{n} \\).\n\n32. As we have found that the coefficients of the second term of the developments of \\((1 + v)^n\\), \\((1 + v)^{\\frac{m}{n}}\\) and \\((1 + v)^{-\\frac{m}{n}}\\) are \\( m, \\frac{m}{n}, \\) and \\(-\\frac{m}{n} \\) respectively, it appears that whatever be the number denoted by \\( n \\), the two first terms of the series expressing \\((1 + v)^n\\) are \\( 1 + n v \\), and therefore, substituting for \\( v \\) its value \\( \\frac{h}{x} \\), and multiplying by \\( x^n \\), the two first terms of the series expressing \\((x + h)^n\\) are \\( x^n + nx^{n-1}h \\), agreeing with what we have\n33. The mode of reasoning employed to determine the ratio of the fluxions of \\( u \\) and \\( x \\), when the former is a function of the latter of the form \\( x^n \\), will apply equally when the function has any other assigned form. But instead of investigating in this manner the fluxion of every particular function, it is better to consider a complex function as the sum, or difference, or product or quotient, &c. of other simple functions, and to investigate rules for each of these cases, supposing that the fluxions of the simple functions are previously known.\n\n34. Let us first suppose that \\( u \\), a function of a variable quantity \\( x \\), is equal to the sum of \\( v \\) and \\( w \\), two other functions of \\( x \\). It is required to find the fluxion of \\( u \\), having given the fluxions of \\( v \\) and \\( w \\).\n\nLet \\( x \\) be conceived to change its value, and to become \\( x + h \\), then, as \\( v \\) and \\( w \\) will also change their values, \u00a7 11, the one to\n\n\\[\nv' = v + p'h + q'h^2 + r'h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nand the other to\n\n\\[\nw' = w + p'h + q'h^2 + r'h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nif \\( u' \\) as usual denote the corresponding new value of \\( u \\), we have\n\n\\[\nu' = v' + w'\n\\]\n\n\\[\nu' = \\{ v + p'h + q'h^2 + \\&c. \\}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nu' = \\{ w + p'h + q'h^2 + \\&c. \\}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nu' = (p + p')h + (q + q')h^2 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nIf we now conceive \\( h \\) to be continually diminished, we shall have the limit of \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\) expressed by \\( p + p' \\). But \\( p \\) is the limit of \\( \\frac{v' - v}{h} \\), \u00a7 14, and in like manner \\( p' \\) is the limit of \\( \\frac{w' - w}{h} \\), therefore,\n\n\\[\n\\text{limit of } \\frac{u' - u}{h} = \\text{limit of } \\frac{v' - v}{h} + \\text{limit of } \\frac{w' - w}{h}.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute now the ratio of the fluxions instead of the limiting ratios, and we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} = \\frac{\\dot{v}}{x} + \\frac{\\dot{w}}{x};\n\\]\n\ntherefore, \\( \\dot{u} = \\dot{v} + \\dot{w} \\).\n\n35. If we suppose \\( s \\) to be a function of \\( x \\), and \\( u, v, w, \\&c. \\) other functions of \\( x \\), such that\n\n\\[\ns = au + bv + cw + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a, b, c \\), denote any given numbers, positive or negative, then, by reasoning as above, it is evident that\n\n\\[\n\\dot{s} = a\\dot{u} + b\\dot{v} + c\\dot{w} + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, to find the fluxion of the sum of any number of functions, each multiplied by a constant quantity. Multiply the fluxion of each function by its constant coefficient, and the sum of the products is the fluxion required.\n\n36. If \\( c \\) denote a constant quantity, and \\( u, v \\), be functions of \\( x \\), such that \\( u = c + v \\); then \\( x \\) being supposed to become \\( x + h \\), and consequently \\( v \\) to become \\( v' \\), or \\( v + p'h + q'h^2 + \\&c. \\) and \\( c + v \\) to become \\( c + v' + p'h + q'h^2 + \\&c. \\) we have\n\n\\[\nu = c + v,\n\\]\n\nand hence \\( u' = c + v' + p'h + q'h^2 + \\&c. \\)\n\nor \\( u' = u + v' - v \\),\n\ntherefore, \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} = \\frac{v' - v}{h} \\),\n\nand these ratios being always equal, their limits must also be equal; therefore, substituting for the limiting ratios those of the fluxions, we have \\( \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} = \\frac{\\dot{v}}{x} \\) and \\( \\dot{u} = \\dot{v} \\); that is to say, the fluxion of \\( c + v \\) is \\( \\dot{v} \\), from which it appears, That the fluxion of any variable function is the very same as the fluxion of the same function, increased or diminished by any constant quantity. This is a remark of great importance in the theory of fluxions, as will appear hereafter.\n\n37. Let us now suppose that \\( u, v, w \\), are functions of \\( x \\), such that \\( u = vw \\), it is required to find the fluxion of \\( u \\), supposing the fluxions of \\( v \\) and \\( w \\) to be given.\n\nBy supposing that \\( x, u, v \\) and \\( w \\) change their values as usual, we have\n\n\\[\nu = vw\n\\]\n\n\\[\nu' = (v + p'h + q'h^2 + \\&c.) (w + p'h + q'h^2 + \\&c.)\n\\]\n\nand this last expression by multiplication becomes\n\n\\[\nu' = vw + vp'h + vq'h^2 + wp'h + wp'h^2 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\ntherefore\n\n\\[\nu' - u = (vp' + wp')h + (vq' + wp')h^2 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\ndividing now by \\( h \\), and taking the limit of \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\), we have that limit expressed by \\( vp' + wp' \\); but \\( p' \\) is the limit of \\( \\frac{v' - v}{h} \\), \u00a7 14, and in like manner \\( p \\) is the limit of \\( \\frac{w' - w}{h} \\); therefore\n\n(c) In this investigation we have supposed \\( n \\) to be a rational number. If, however, it were irrational, still the result would be the same; for, corresponding to every such number, two rational numbers, one greater, and the other less than it, may be found, which shall differ from each other by less than any assignable quantity. Therefore, the general properties of these numbers must belong also to the irrational number which is their limit.\nthe limit of \\( \\frac{u'}{h} = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l}\nv \\times \\text{limit of } \\frac{w' - w}{h} \\\\\n+w \\times \\text{limit of } \\frac{v' - v}{h}\n\\end{array} \\right. \\);\n\nHence, by substituting for the limiting ratios the ratios of the fluxions, we have\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} = \\frac{v \\dot{w}}{x} + \\frac{w \\dot{v}}{x} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\dot{u} = v \\dot{w} + w \\dot{v}. \\]\n\nTherefore, to find the fluxion of the product of any two functions, multiply the fluxion of each function by the other function, and the sum of these products is the fluxion required.\n\n38. We have just now seen that when\n\n\\[ u = v w \\]\n\nthen\n\n\\[ \\dot{u} = w \\dot{v} + v \\dot{w}. \\]\n\nLet each side of the latter equation be divided by the corresponding side of the former, thus we get\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{u}}{u} = \\frac{\\dot{v}}{v} + \\frac{\\dot{w}}{w}, \\]\n\nsuppose now that the function \\( w \\) is the product of two other functions \\( s, t \\), so that\n\n\\[ u = v s t, \\]\n\nthen, because \\( w = s t \\), from what has been shewn it follows that \\( \\frac{\\dot{w}}{w} = \\frac{\\dot{s}}{s} + \\frac{\\dot{t}}{t} \\); therefore, substituting this value of \\( \\frac{\\dot{w}}{w} \\) in the equation \\( \\frac{\\dot{u}}{u} = \\frac{\\dot{v}}{v} + \\frac{\\dot{w}}{w} \\), it becomes\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{u}}{u} = \\frac{\\dot{v}}{v} + \\frac{\\dot{s}}{s} + \\frac{\\dot{t}}{t}. \\]\n\nIn general, if we suppose that\n\n\\[ u = v s t r &c. \\]\n\nby reasoning as above it will be found that\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{u}}{u} = \\frac{\\dot{v}}{v} + \\frac{\\dot{s}}{s} + \\frac{\\dot{t}}{t} + \\frac{\\dot{r}}{r} + &c. \\]\n\nwhatever be the number of factors.\n\nSuppose the number of factors to be three, so that\n\n\\[ u = v s t, \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{u}}{u} = \\frac{\\dot{v}}{v} + \\frac{\\dot{s}}{s} + \\frac{\\dot{t}}{t}, \\]\n\nthen substituting \\( v s t \\) for \\( u \\) in this last equation, and taking away the denominators, we find\n\n\\[ \\dot{u} = \\dot{v} \\dot{s} \\dot{t} + v \\dot{s} \\dot{t} + v s \\dot{t}. \\]\n\nAnd as a similar result will be found, whatever be the number of factors, we may conclude that The fluxion of the product of any number of functions is equal to the sum of the products of the fluxion of each function by all the other functions.\n\n39. Let us in the last place suppose that \\( u = \\frac{v}{w} \\), and that it is required to find the fluxion of \\( u \\), having given the fluxions of \\( v \\) and \\( w \\).\n\nFrom the given equation we have \\( v = w u \\), and therefore (\u00a7 37.) \\( \\dot{v} = w \\dot{u} + u \\dot{w} \\), let \\( \\frac{v}{w} \\) be substituted for \\( u \\) in this equation, and it becomes \\( \\dot{v} = w \\dot{u} + \\frac{v \\dot{w}}{w} \\), from which we easily obtain\n\n\\[ \\dot{u} = \\frac{w \\dot{v} - v \\dot{w}}{w^2}. \\]\n\nHence we have the following rule for finding the fluxion of a fraction.\n\nMultiply the fluxion of the numerator by the denominator, and from the product subtract the fluxion of the denominator multiplied by the numerator, and divide the remainder by the square of the denominator; the result is the fluxion required.\n\n40. It will now be proper to shew the application of these general rules for determining the fluxions of variable functions to some particular examples.\n\nExample 1. Suppose \\( u = a + b \\sqrt{x} - \\frac{c}{x} \\). Required the fluxion of \\( u \\).\n\nHere \\( a \\) being a constant quantity, the fluxion of \\( a + b \\sqrt{x} - \\frac{c}{x} \\) is the same as the fluxion of \\( b \\sqrt{x} - \\frac{c}{x} \\), \u00a7 36, or \\( b x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} - c x^{-1} \\). Now, by \u00a7 26 the fluxion of \\( x^n \\) is \\( \\frac{n}{2} x^{n-1} \\), which expression is equivalent to \\( \\frac{b}{2 \\sqrt{x}} \\), or to \\( \\frac{b}{2 \\sqrt{x}} \\), and in like manner the fluxion of \\( x^{-1} \\) is \\( -x^{-2} \\), or \\( -x^{-2} \\), or \\( -x^{-2} \\), therefore, multiplying the fluxion of \\( x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\) by \\( b \\), and the fluxion of \\( x^{-1} \\) by \\( c \\), and taking the sum of the products, agreeably to the rule in \u00a7 35, we have\n\n\\[ \\dot{u} = \\frac{b}{2 \\sqrt{x}} + \\frac{c}{x^2} \\]\n\nor \\( \\dot{u} = \\left( \\frac{b}{2 \\sqrt{x}} + \\frac{c}{x^2} \\right) x. \\)\n\nEx. 2. Suppose \\( u = a + \\frac{b}{3 \\sqrt{x^2}} - \\frac{c}{x^3 \\sqrt{x}} + \\frac{d}{x^2} \\).\n\nBy writing the function thus\n\n\\[ u = a + b x^{-\\frac{2}{3}} - c x^{-\\frac{4}{3}} + d x^{-2} \\]\n\nthe application of the same rules employed in the last example gives us\n\n\\[ \\dot{u} = -\\frac{2}{3} b x^{-\\frac{5}{3}} + \\frac{4}{3} c x^{-\\frac{7}{3}} - 2 d x^{-3} \\]\n\nor, exchanging the fractional indices for the radical sign, and otherwise reducing,\n\n\\[ \\dot{u} = \\frac{-2 b \\dot{x}}{3 x^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\sqrt{x}} + \\frac{4 c \\dot{x}}{3 x^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\sqrt{x}} - \\frac{2 d \\dot{x}}{x^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\]\n\nEx. 3.\nEx. 3. Suppose \\( u = (a + bx)^n \\).\n\nIn order to find the fluxion of this function by the rules already laid down, it will be necessary to consider it first as a function of a variable quantity that is itself a function of \\( x \\). Let us then put \\( a + bx^m \\) equal to \\( v \\), and thus the proposed equation becomes \\( u = v^n \\); then, \\( u \\) being considered as a function of \\( v \\), we have by \u00a7 26,\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = n \\dot{v}^{n-1} \\dot{v}.\n\\]\n\nAgain, \\( v \\) being considered as a function of \\( x \\), from the equation \\( v = a + bx^m \\), we find by \u00a7 36, and \u00a7 26, \\( \\dot{v} = m b x^{m-1} \\dot{x} \\); let this value of \\( \\dot{v} \\) be substituted in the expression for \\( \\dot{u} \\), and it becomes\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = mn b x^{m-1} \\dot{x},\n\\]\n\nwhich, by substituting for \\( v \\) its value \\( a + bx^m \\), is also\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = mn b x^{m-1} (a + bx^m)^{n-1} \\dot{x}.\n\\]\n\nEx. 4. Suppose \\( u = \\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)} \\).\n\nHere we are to proceed as in the last example, and first put \\( a^2 - x^2 = v \\), then \\( u = \\sqrt{v} \\); and therefore\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{\\dot{v}}{2 \\sqrt{v}}.\n\\]\n\nAgain, since \\( v = a^2 - x^2 \\), by \u00a7 26, we find \\( \\dot{v} = -2x \\dot{x} \\). Substitute this value of \\( \\dot{v} \\) in the expression for \\( \\dot{u} \\), and we have\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{-2x \\dot{x}}{2 \\sqrt{v}},\n\\]\n\nwhich, by restoring \\( \\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)} \\) for \\( v \\), and leaving out the number common to the numerator and denominator, becomes\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{-x \\dot{x}}{\\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)}}.\n\\]\n\nEx. 5. Suppose \\( u = \\sqrt{(a + bx + cx^2)} \\).\n\nBy proceeding in the same manner as in last example we find\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{(b + 2cx) \\dot{x}}{\\sqrt{(a + bx + cx^2)}}.\n\\]\n\nEx. 6. Suppose \\( u = \\sqrt{(a^2 + x^2)} \\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)} \\).\n\nHere the proposed function is the product of these three functions, viz \\( x \\), \\( a^2 + x^2 \\), and \\( \\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)} \\). Therefore, its fluxion will be found by proceeding according to the rule in \u00a7 38.\n\nNow the fluxion of \\( x \\) is \\( \\dot{x} \\), and the fluxion of \\( a^2 + x^2 \\) is \\( 2x \\dot{x} \\), and the fluxion of \\( \\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)} \\) has been found in last example to be \\( \\frac{-x \\dot{x}}{\\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)}} \\). Therefore, multiplying the fluxion of each function by the product of the other two functions, and taking the sum of all these products, we find\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\left( \\frac{(a^2 + x^2) \\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)}}{2} \\right) \\dot{x} + \\left( \\frac{x^2 (a^2 + x^2)}{\\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)}} \\right) \\dot{x}.\n\\]\n\nEx. 7. Suppose \\( u = \\frac{a + x}{a^2 + x^2} \\).\n\nHere we employ the rule given in \u00a7 39, for finding the fluxion of a fractional function; thus we find\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{(a^2 + x^2) \\dot{x} - 2x (a + x) \\dot{x}}{(a^2 + x^2)^2},\n\\]\n\nwhich when reduced is\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{(a^2 - 2ax - x^2) \\dot{x}}{(a^2 + x^2)^2}.\n\\]\n\nEx. 8. Suppose\n\n\\[\na = \\sqrt{(a - \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{x}} + \\sqrt{(c^2 - x^2)})}.\n\\]\n\nTo simplify this expression we put\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{\\sqrt{x}} = y, \\quad \\sqrt{(c^2 - x^2)} = z,\n\\]\n\nThus we have\n\n\\[\nu = \\sqrt{(a - y + z)} = (a - y + z)^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\n\\]\n\nNow as the fluxion of \\( a - y + z \\), is \\( -y + z \\) (\u00a7 35), we find from \u00a7 26, that by considering \\( a - y + z \\) as a single variable quantity,\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{1}{2} (a - y + z)^{\\frac{1}{2}} (-y + z),\n\\]\n\nbut, since \\( y = \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{x}} = b x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\), we have, \u00a7 26,\n\n\\[\n\\dot{y} = -\\frac{b}{2x \\sqrt{x}} \\dot{x};\n\\]\n\nand since \\( z = \\sqrt{(c^2 - x^2)} = (c^2 - x^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\), by considering \\( c^2 - x^2 \\) as a single variable quantity, and observing that its fluxion is \\( -2x \\dot{x} \\), we find by \u00a7 26, that\n\n\\[\n\\dot{z} = \\frac{1}{2} (c^2 - x^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}} (-2x \\dot{x}) = \\frac{-4x \\dot{x}}{3 \\sqrt{(c^2 - x^2)}}.\n\\]\n\nInstead of \\( y, z, \\dot{y}, \\dot{z} \\), substitute now their values in the expression for the fluxion of \\( u \\), thus it becomes\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{(a - \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{x}} + \\sqrt{(c^2 - x^2)})} \\left( \\frac{b \\dot{x}}{2x \\sqrt{x}} - \\frac{4x \\dot{x}}{3 \\sqrt{(c^2 - x^2)}} \\right).\n\\]\n\nEx. 9.

As when \\( u \\) denotes that particular function of \\( x \\) which is \\( x^a \\), we have (\u00a7 25.)\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = ax^{a-1};\n\\]\n\nso in general, whatever be the form of the function denoted by \\( u \\), we have always\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = p,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( p \\) denotes a new function of \\( x \\), resulting from the analytical process employed to find the fluxion of the function \\( u \\), and depending for its form upon the particular form of that function: just as in involution, or any of the other operations of algebra, a result is obtained depending upon the particular nature of the operation, and the quantities operated upon.\n\nLet us put \\( p \\) to denote the particular function \\( n x^{n-1} \\),\nor the expression for \\( \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} \\), the ratio of the fluxion of \\( u \\) to the fluxion of \\( x \\) when \\( u = x^n \\), then, supposing that \\( n-1 \\)\nis not equal to 0, (for in that case \\( n x^{n-1} \\) would be simply \\( n \\), a given number,) we may reason concerning the ratio of the fluxions of the variable quantities \\( p \\) and \\( x \\),\nin all respects as concerning the ratio of the fluxions of \\( u \\) and \\( x \\); and accordingly, from the equation\n\n\\[\np = nx^{n-1},\n\\]\n\nwe get, by taking the fluxions,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{p}}{x} = n(n-1)x^{n-2},\n\\]\n\nor, considering \\( p \\) as denoting generally the function of \\( x \\) that results from the operation of finding the fluxion of the original function \\( u \\), whatever be the form of that function, we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{p}}{x} = q,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( q \\) denotes a new function of \\( x \\), derived from \\( p \\), the former function, by the same kind of operation as that by which \\( p \\) was deduced from \\( u \\).\n\nSuppose now \\( q \\) to denote the particular function \\( n(n-1)x^{n-2} \\), then,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{q}}{x} = n(n-1)(n-2)x^{n-3},\n\\]\n\nor \\( \\frac{\\dot{q}}{x} = r \\),\n\nwhere \\( r \\) denotes a function of \\( x \\) derived from \\( q \\), as \\( q \\) was derived from \\( p \\), or \\( p \\) from the original function \\( u \\).\n\nAnd it is evident that we may proceed in this manner as far as we please, unless it happen that in finding the series of functions \\( p, q, r, \\&c. \\) we at last arrive at a result that is a constant quantity, and then the series of operations will terminate. Thus if the function was \\( ax^4 \\), we should have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\dot{u} &= ax^4, \\\\\n\\dot{u} &= 4ax^3 = p, \\\\\n\\dot{p} &= 4.3ax^2 = q, \\\\\n\\dot{q} &= 4.3.2ax = r, \\\\\n\\dot{r} &= 4.3.2.1.a = 24a.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHere the expression for \\( \\frac{\\dot{r}}{x} \\) is a constant quantity, which has no fluxion.\n\nHence it appears, that relatively to any function of a variable quantity, there exists a series of limiting ratios, deducible from that function, and from each other, by a repetition of the operation of finding the fluxion of a variable function.\n\n42. In treating of the fluxion of a function, we have hitherto regarded the fluxion of the variable quantity \\( x \\), from which the function is formed, merely as one of the terms of a ratio, without considering whether it was a constant or a variable quantity.\n\nNow as we may assume any hypothesis respecting the nature of the fluxion of \\( x \\), that is not inconsistent with what has been already delivered, we shall suppose it to be constant. This assumption, if we consider the fluxions of variable quantities as the measures of their respective velocities, or rates of increase, is in effect the same thing as to suppose that the variable quantity \\( x \\) increases uniformly. Then, as in the expressions\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} = p, \\quad \\frac{\\dot{p}}{x} = q, \\quad \\frac{\\dot{q}}{x} = r, \\quad \\&c.\n\\]\n\nor these others, which follow from them,\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = p \\dot{x}, \\quad \\dot{p} = q \\dot{x}, \\quad \\dot{q} = r \\dot{x}, \\quad \\&c.\n\\]\n\nthe symbol \\( \\dot{x} \\) is to be understood as denoting a constant quantity, it follows that if \\( p \\) be variable, then \\( p \\dot{x} \\), or \\( \\dot{u} \\) will be variable; and if \\( q \\) be variable, then \\( q \\dot{x} \\), or \\( \\dot{p} \\), will...\nLet us now recur to the relation in which the succeeding functions \\( p, q, r, \\) &c., stand to the original function \\( u \\).\n\nBy performing that particular analytical operation upon the function \\( u \\), which consists in finding its fluxion, we obtain \\( p \\dot{x} \\) as the expression for its fluxion, that is, we get \\( u = p \\dot{x} \\); and by repeating the operation on the function \\( p \\), we get \\( p = q \\dot{x} \\); and therefore \\( p \\dot{x} = q \\dot{x}^2 \\); but, \\( x \\) being regarded as a constant quantity, \\( p \\dot{x} \\) is deduced from \\( p \\dot{x} \\), considered as a function of \\( x \\), just in the same manner as \\( p \\dot{x} \\) is derived from the original function \\( u \\); therefore the expression \\( q \\dot{x}^2 \\) is deduced from the function \\( u \\) by performing the operation of taking the fluxion twice; that is, first upon the function \\( u \\) itself, and then upon \\( u \\), or \\( p \\dot{x} \\), the expression for its fluxion; and in this second operation \\( \\dot{x} \\) (or the fluxion of the quantity from which the function is formed) is considered as a constant quantity.\n\nThe expression \\( q \\dot{x}^2 \\), obtained in this manner from the function \\( u \\), is called the second fluxion of the function; and to express its relation to the function \\( u \\), it is denoted by \\( u \\), that is, by the letter denoting the function itself with two dots over it. Thus, like as \\( u = p \\dot{x} \\), we have\n\n\\[\nu = q \\dot{x}^2, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\ddot{u} = q.\n\\]\n\nAgain, since \\( q = r \\dot{x} \\), it follows that \\( q \\dot{x}^2 = r \\dot{x}^3 \\); but, as \\( x \\) is constant, \\( q \\dot{x}^2 \\) is derived from \\( q \\dot{x} \\), by the operation of finding its fluxion, considering it as a function of \\( x \\), just in the same manner as \\( q \\dot{x}^2 \\), or \\( u \\), is derived from \\( p \\dot{x} \\), or \\( u \\), and in the same manner as \\( u \\) is derived from the original function \\( u \\); therefore, like as \\( p \\dot{x} \\) or \\( u \\) is the first fluxion of the function, and \\( q \\dot{x}^2 \\) or \\( u \\) is its second fluxion, so \\( r \\dot{x}^3 \\) is called its third fluxion, and is denoted by \\( \\ddot{u} \\), that is by the letter expressing the function itself, having three dots placed over it, so that\n\n\\[\n\\ddot{u} = r \\dot{x}^3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\ddot{\\ddot{u}} = r.\n\\]\n\nThe fourth fluxion of a variable function \\( u \\) is denoted by \\( \\ddot{\\ddot{u}} \\), that is by the letter \\( u \\) with four dots over it, and is derived from the third fluxion, in the same manner as the third is derived from the second, or the second from the first, or the first fluxion from the variable function itself; observing, that in repeating the operation of taking the fluxions, the symbol \\( x \\) (or the fluxion of the variable quantity from which the function is formed) is considered as a constant quantity. And the same mode of notation and deduction is to be understood as applying to a fluxion of any order whatever of a variable function.\n\nTo illustrate what has been said respecting the second and higher orders of fluxions of a function, let us suppose \\( u \\) to denote the particular function \\( a x^n \\); then, proceeding agreeably to what has been laid down in last section, we obtain, by the rule for finding the fluxion of any power of a variable quantity (\\$ 26)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\dot{u} &= n a x^{n-1} \\dot{x}, \\\\\n\\ddot{u} &= n(n-1) a x^{n-2} \\dot{x}^2, \\\\\n\\ddot{\\ddot{u}} &= n(n-1)(n-2) a x^{n-3} \\dot{x}^3, \\\\\n\\ddot{\\ddot{\\ddot{u}}} &= n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) a x^{n-4} \\dot{x}^4, \\quad \\text{&c.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHere we have exhibited the first, second, third, and fourth fluxions of the function \\( a x^n \\); the law of continuation is obvious, and it appears that when \\( n \\) is any positive integer, the function \\( a x^n \\) will have as many orders of fluxions, as there are units in \\( n \\), and no more; for if \\( n \\) were supposed \\( = 3 \\), then, as the fourth fluxion, and all the subsequent ones, are multiplied by \\( n-3 \\), or in that case by \\( 3-3=0 \\), they consequently would vanish, and a similar observation may be made when \\( n \\) is any other whole positive number.\n\nThat we might be able to apply the rules of \\$ 26, \u00a7 34, &c. to the determination of the fluxion of a complex function of a variable quantity, we have found it convenient in some cases to consider such a function as composed of other more simple functions of the same quantity, and we have expressed its fluxion by means of the fluxions of those other functions. In finding the fluxion of any higher order than the first of such a complex function by those rules, we must keep in mind, that it is only the fluxion of \\( x \\), the variable quantity from which the functions are all formed, that is to be considered as constant, and that the fluxions of the functions themselves are in general variable quantities; so that each of them may have a second, third, &c. fluxion, as well as the function which is composed of them.\n\nLet us suppose for example, that\n\n\\[\nu = \\sqrt{(a^2 + x^2)};\n\\]\n\nthen, considering \\( a^2 + x^2 \\) as a function of \\( x \\), and putting \\( v \\) to denote it, we have \\( u = \\sqrt{v} = v^{1/2} \\), and \\( \\dot{u} = \\frac{1}{2} v^{-1/2} \\dot{v} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\dot{v}}{\\sqrt{v}} \\); but since \\( v = a^2 + x^2 \\), it follows that \\( \\dot{v} = 2x \\); therefore, substituting for \\( v \\) and \\( \\dot{v} \\) their respective values, we have\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(a^2 + x^2)}}.\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the second fluxion of \\( u \\), we may either take the fluxion of this last expression, viz. \\( \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(a^2 + x^2)}} \\), and consider the symbol \\( x \\), which is found in it, as denoting a constant quantity; or we may recur to the equation \\( \\dot{u} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\dot{v}}{\\sqrt{v}} \\) and take the fluxion of this other expression for \\( u \\); and in this case, we must consider that both \\( v \\) and \\( \\dot{v} \\) denote variable functions of \\( x \\), and therefore that the fluxion of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\dot{v}}{\\sqrt{v}} \\) may be found by the rule\nfor finding the fluxion of a function; observing that \\( \\dot{v} \\) is to be substituted as the fluxion of \\( v \\). Accordingly, proceeding by this last method, and considering that the fluxion of \\( \\sqrt{v} \\) the denominator of the fraction is \\( \\frac{\\dot{v}}{\\sqrt{v}} \\), we find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\dot{u} &= \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{v} \\cdot \\dot{v} - \\frac{3}{4} \\frac{\\dot{v}^2}{\\sqrt{v}}, \\\\\n&= \\frac{2}{4} \\frac{\\dot{v}^2}{\\sqrt{v}}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNow from the equation \\( v = a + x^2 \\), we have \\( \\dot{v} = 2x \\dot{x} \\), and (observing that \\( x \\) is constant) \\( \\ddot{v} = 2x^2 \\). Let these values of \\( v, \\dot{v}, \\ddot{v} \\), be now substituted in the expression for \\( u \\), and it becomes\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\dot{u} &= \\frac{4(a^2 + x^2)}{4(a^2 + x^2)} \\cdot \\frac{\\dot{x}^2}{\\sqrt{(a^2 + x^2)}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{a^2 x^2}{(a^2 + x^2)^{3/2}}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe very same expression for \\( u \\) would have been found if we had employed the other method.\n\nBy proceeding as in this last example, the rules already delivered for finding the first fluxion of any function of a variable quantity will apply to the finding of the fluxion of any higher order.\n\nThus if we had \\( u = v \\cdot t \\), where \\( v \\) and \\( t \\) denote each a function of another variable quantity \\( x \\), and it were required to find the different orders of fluxions of \\( u \\), considered also as a function of \\( x \\); then, by the rule of \u00a7 37, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\dot{u} &= \\dot{v} \\cdot t + v \\cdot \\dot{t}, \\\\\n\\ddot{u} &= \\text{fluxion of } \\dot{v} \\cdot t + \\text{fluxion of } v \\cdot \\dot{t};\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nbut \\( v \\) and \\( t \\) being variable functions of \\( x \\), we may consider \\( v \\) and \\( t \\) as denoting also variable functions of \\( x \\), the fluxions of which are to be denoted by \\( \\dot{v} \\) and \\( \\dot{t} \\) respectively; now by the rule in \u00a7 37, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{fluxion of } \\dot{v} \\cdot t &= \\dot{v} \\cdot \\dot{t} + \\dot{v} \\cdot \\dot{t}, \\\\\n\\text{and fluxion of } v \\cdot \\dot{t} &= v \\cdot \\dot{t} + v \\cdot \\dot{t},\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\ntherefore, \\( \\ddot{u} = 2 \\dot{v} \\cdot \\dot{t} + \\dot{v} \\cdot \\dot{t} + v \\cdot \\dot{t} \\).\n\nBy considering \\( v, \\dot{v}, \\ddot{v} \\), also \\( t, \\dot{t}, \\ddot{t} \\), as denoting each a distinct function of \\( x \\), we may find the third fluxion of \\( u \\) from the second, in the same manner as the second has been found from the first, and so on for the other orders of fluxions of \\( u \\). If it be now required to express the successive orders of fluxions of \\( u \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and its fluxion, we must find the values of \\( \\dot{v}, \\ddot{v}, \\ddot{v} \\), also of \\( \\dot{t}, \\ddot{t}, \\ddot{t} \\), in terms of \\( x \\) and its fluxion, and these values, also the particular functions of \\( x \\) denoted by \\( v \\) and \\( t \\), being substituted in the expressions found for \\( u, \\dot{u}, \\ddot{u} \\), &c., will give to these expressions the form required.\n\nIf for example we suppose that\n\n\\[ w = a + bx^n, \\quad i = c + dx^n, \\]\n\nthen \\( \\dot{w} = m \\cdot b \\cdot x^{m-1}, \\quad \\dot{i} = n \\cdot d \\cdot x^{n-1} \\),\n\nand, considering \\( x \\) as constant,\n\n\\[ \\ddot{w} = m(m-1)b \\cdot x^{m-2}, \\quad \\ddot{i} = n(n-1)d \\cdot x^{n-2}. \\]\n\nThese values of \\( \\dot{w}, \\dot{i}, \\ddot{w}, \\ddot{i}, \\) &c., being substituted in the expressions of \\( u, \\dot{u}, \\ddot{u}, \\) &c., will give the successive fluxions of \\( u \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( \\dot{x} \\) only.\n\n46. If the fluxion of a variable quantity be considered as the measure of its rate of increase, if that rate be uniform, then its measure will be a constant quantity; but if it be variable, then its measure will be a variable quantity, which will also have a certain rate of increase or decrease; and the measure of this rate will be its fluxion, or will be the fluxion of the fluxion of the original variable quantity; that is, it will be the second fluxion of the original variable quantity. And if this second fluxion is not a constant quantity, then the measure of its rate of variation will be its fluxion, or will be the third fluxion of the original variable quantity, and so on. Thus a quantity will have a successive order of fluxions till some one fluxion become constant, and then it will have no more.\n\n47. We have hitherto supposed the equation expressing the relation between a variable quantity, and a function of that quantity, to be of such a form, that the function was found alone, and of the first degree on one side of the equation, and some power, or combination of powers, of the variable quantity on the other; as in these examples,\n\n\\[ u = ax^n, \\quad u = \\frac{a + bx^n}{c + dx^n}. \\]\n\nIn such cases as these, \\( u \\) is said to be an explicit function of \\( x \\). We are now to consider how the ratio of the fluxions is to be found when the relation between the variable quantity and its function is expressed by an equation, the terms of which involve different powers, both of the function, and the variable quantity; as in the following example,\n\n\\[ y^2 - axy + bx^2 - c = 0, \\]\n\nwhere we are to consider \\( y \\) as a function of \\( x \\); but from the particular manner in which its relation to \\( x \\) is expressed, it is said to be an implicit function of that quantity.\n\nNow in this example, by the resolution of a quadratic equation, we find\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{ax \\pm \\sqrt{(a^2 - 4b)x^2 + 4c}}{2}, \\]\n\nand as \\( y \\) is here an explicit function of \\( x \\), its fluxion, or the ratio of its fluxion to that of \\( x \\), might be determined by the rules already laid down. But it is to be observed that it is only in the particular case of the proposed equation being of the second degree that we can effect the solution generally in this manner. If it were\nwere of a higher order, this particular mode of solution would be often impracticable, for want of a general method of resolving equations.\n\n48. We may however in all cases resolve the problem, without a previous resolution of the equation, by reasoning as follows.\n\nWhatever be the degree of the equation, by giving particular values to \\( x \\), we can, by the theory of equations, obtain corresponding particular values of \\( y \\); therefore, we may be assured that in every case \\( y \\) is expressible by means of \\( x \\) in some way or other, if not in finite terms, at least in the form of a series, the terms of which shall involve powers of \\( x \\). Hence we may infer, as in the case of explicit functions, that when \\( x \\) changes its value, and becomes \\( x + h \\), \\( y \\) will also change its value, and become\n\n\\[\ny + p h + q h^2 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( p, q, \\ldots \\) denote functions of \\( x \\), that are independent of the arbitrary quantity \\( h \\). Let us denote \\( p b + q h^2 + \\ldots \\) the increment of \\( y \\), by the single letter \\( k \\); then \\( y + k \\) is the new value of \\( y \\), corresponding to \\( x + h \\), the new value of \\( x \\). Let these new values be substituted instead of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in the proposed equation\n\n\\[\ny^2 - ax y + bx^2 = c = 0,\n\\]\n\nand as the result must still be \\( = 0 \\), we have\n\n\\[\n(y + k)^2 - a(x + h)(y + k) + b(x + h)^2 = c = 0;\n\\]\n\nwhich equation, by actually involving its terms, substituting for \\( k \\) its value \\( p h + q h^2 + \\ldots \\), and arranging the result in the form of a series proceeding by the powers of \\( h \\), becomes\n\n\\[\n(2py - a(p x + y) + 2b x)h = 0\n\\]\n\nHere \\( Q, R, \\ldots \\) denote quantities independent of \\( h \\), and involving \\( x, y, p, q, \\ldots \\), that is to say, \\( x \\), and functions of \\( x \\), and therefore \\( Q, R, \\ldots \\) are also functions of \\( x \\). Now as this equation must satisfy whatever \\( h \\) may be, which is a quantity quite arbitrary and independent of the coefficients by which its powers are multiplied; it follows (as has been observed when treating of the method of indeterminate coefficients, Algebra, \u00a7 261.) that the coefficients of the different powers of \\( h \\) must be each equal to \\( 0 \\).\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\ny^2 - ax y + bx^2 = c = 0\n\\]\n\nFrom the first of these equations we can infer nothing, as it is no other than the proposed equation itself; but from the second we find\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{ay - 2bx}{2y - ax}.\n\\]\n\nNow \\( h \\), and \\( k = ph + q h^2 + \\ldots \\), being the simultaneous increments of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we have \\( \\frac{k}{h} = p + q h + \\ldots \\), therefore, supposing \\( h \\) to be continually diminished, and putting \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\) equal to the limit of \\( \\frac{k}{h} \\), we have \\( \\frac{y}{x} = p \\), therefore\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{ay - 2bx}{2y - ax};\n\\]\n\nthus we have obtained an expression for the ratio of the fluxions of \\( y \\) and \\( x \\), from which we find\n\n\\[\n2yy' - a(xy + y') + 2bxx' = 0,\n\\]\n\nand this is precisely the expression we should have obtained, had we taken the fluxion of each term of\n\n\\[\ny^2 - ax y + bx^2 = c = 0,\n\\]\n\nthe proposed equation, and put the result equal to \\( 0 \\).\n\n49. But to see that this will always be the case, whatever be the degree of the equation, we have only to observe, that, by the very same process employed to deduce from the original equation\n\n\\[\ny^2 - ax y + bx^2 = c = 0,\n\\]\n\nthese two others\n\n\\[\n2py - a(p x + y) + 2b x = 0,\n\\]\n\nif we suppose the equation to be generally expressed thus,\n\n\\[\ny^l + ay^m \\cdots + bx^r + c = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhere the exponents \\( l, m, n, \\ldots \\) denote constant quantities, we shall obtain\n\n\\[\nly^{l-1}p + a(my^{m-1}x^n + nx^{n-1}x) = 0,\n\\]\n\nand hence, by substituting for \\( p \\) its value \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\), and bringing \\( x \\) from the denominator,\n\n\\[\nly^{l-1}y + a(my^{m-1}x^n + nx^{n-1}x) = 0.\n\\]\n\nFrom which it appears that, when the relation between \\( x \\), a variable quantity, and \\( y \\), a function of that quantity, is expressed by an equation, the terms of which are brought all to one side, so as to produce an expression \\( = 0 \\); the relation of the fluxions will be found, by taking the fluxion of each term of the equation (considering \\( y \\) as a function of \\( x \\)), and putting the sum of these fluxions equal to \\( 0 \\).\n\n50. Having from the equation\n\n\\[\ny^2 - ax y + bx^2 = c = 0,\n\\]\n\nfound that\n\n\\[\ny' = \\frac{(ay - 2bx)x'}{2y - ax},\n\\]\n\nif it be required to find the second fluxion of \\( y \\), we have only to take the fluxion of the latter side of this equation,\nequation, considering \\( x \\) as constant, and \\( y \\) as a function of \\( x \\); thus we have\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{(2y - ax)(ay - 2bx)}{(2y - ax)^2}\n\\]\n\nan equation which abbreviates to\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{(4l - a^2)(ay - bx)}{(2y - ax)^2},\n\\]\n\nand from which we may exterminate \\( y \\) by means of the equation\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{(ay - bx)x}{2y - ax}.\n\\]\n\nBy the same mode of proceeding we may determine the third, or any higher fluxion of the function \\( y \\).\n\n51. As far as we have yet gone in explaining the principles of fluxions, we have had continually occasion to employ the rule for finding the fluxion of the particular function \\( x^n \\), where \\( x \\) denotes a variable quantity, and \\( n \\) any constant number; and we may therefore, in respect of other functions consider \\( x^n \\) as a simple function. Besides the function \\( x^n \\), writers on Analysis have considered each of the following as also constituting a simple analytic function of a variable quantity; viz.\n\n- \\( a^x \\), where \\( a \\) is constant, and \\( x \\) is variable.\n- Log. \\( x \\), that is the logarithm of \\( x \\), a variable number.\n- Sin. \\( x \\), that is the sine of \\( x \\), a variable arch of a circle, radius being unity.\n- Cot. \\( x \\), that is the cotangent of \\( x \\), a variable arch of a circle, radius being as before unity.\n\n52. We have already found the fluxion of \\( x^n \\), and we proceed to find the fluxions of the other simple functions of \\( x \\); and, as in the investigation of these we shall have occasion to employ the binomial theorem, it will be proper to show how that theorem may be deduced from the principles already explained. We are then to find the series that expresses \\((a + x)^n\\), when \\( n \\) is any number whatever. Or, since \\((a + x)^n\\) is equal to \\( a^n (1 + v)^n \\), where \\( v \\) denotes the fraction \\( \\frac{x}{a} \\), we may leave the quantity \\( a^n \\) out of consideration, as has been formerly observed, \u00a7 28, and seek the series that expresses \\((1 + v)^n\\). As we have already pointed out (\u00a7 28) the process of induction by which we may find the general form of the series, we shall not here repeat it, but assume\n\n\\[\n(1 + v)^n = 1 + A v + B v^2 + C v^3 + D v^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A, B, C, D, \\ldots \\) denote numbers that are independent of \\( v \\).\n\nNow, as the fluxion of a variable function must be the same, whether that function be expressed by one term, or developed into a series of terms; by performing the operation of taking the fluxion on each side of the above equation, the results must be equal, that is, \u00a7 26.\n\nLet\n\n\\[\nn(x + v)^{n-1}v = A v + 2B v^2 + 3C v^3 + 4D v^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nor, leaving out the quantity \\( v \\), common to each term,\n\n\\[\nn(x + v)^{n-1} = A + 2B v + 3C v^2 + 4D v^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nLet both sides of this equation be multiplied by \\( 1 + v \\), and divided by \\( n \\), thus we shall have\n\n\\[\n(1 + v)^n = \\frac{A + 2B v + 3C v^2 + 4D v^3 + \\ldots}{n}\n\\]\n\nThus, by performing on the quantities the analytical process of taking their fluxions, we have obtained a new expression for \\((1 + v)^n\\). Let the quantities that are independent of \\( v \\) in each expression be put equal to each other, and also the coefficients of like powers of \\( v \\); thus we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1 &= \\frac{A}{n}, \\\\\nA &= \\frac{A + 2B}{n}, \\\\\nB &= \\frac{2B + 3C}{n}, \\\\\nC &= \\frac{3C + 4D}{n}, \\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nOr, substituting successively the expression for each coefficient in that which follows it,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nA &= n, \\\\\nB &= \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, \\\\\nC &= \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{2 \\cdot 3}, \\\\\nD &= \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4}, \\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHence it appears that\n\n\\[\n(1 + v)^n = 1 + nv + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}v^2 + \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{2 \\cdot 3}v^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nand therefore, substituting \\( \\frac{x}{a} \\) for \\( v \\), and multiplying by \\( a^n \\),\n\n\\[\n(a + x)^n = a^n + na^{n-1}x + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}a^{n-2}x^2 + \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{2 \\cdot 3}a^{n-3}x^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhere the law of continuation is evident.\n\n53. We now proceed to investigate the fluxion of the function \\( u = a^x \\), \\( a \\) being supposed constant, and \\( x \\) the variable quantity, to which the function is referred.\nLet \\( x \\) be supposed, as formerly, to change its value, and to become \\( x + h \\), and put \\( u' \\) for the new value that the function acquires by this change in the magnitude of \\( x \\); then we have\n\n\\[\nu' = a^x + b = a^x \\times a^b,\n\\]\n\nand, taking the difference between the two succeeding values,\n\n\\[\nu' - u = a^x \\times a^b - a^x = a^x (a^b - 1).\n\\]\n\nWe must now develop the expression \\( a^b - 1 \\) into a series, the terms of which are arranged according to the successive powers of the increment \\( h \\). To effect this, let us put \\( b = a - 1 \\), so that \\( a = 1 + b \\), and \\( a^b = (1 + b)^b \\); but by the binomial theorem, this last expression may be expanded into the following series:\n\n\\[\n1 + hb + \\frac{h(h-1)}{2}b^2 + \\frac{h(h-1)(h-2)}{2 \\cdot 3}b^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\na^b = 1 + hb + \\frac{h(h-1)}{2}b^2 + \\frac{h(h-1)(h-2)}{2 \\cdot 3}b^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nAs the terms of this series are not arranged according to the powers of \\( h \\), but according to the powers of \\( b \\), it is necessary that we transform it into another having the required form; now this may be effected by actually multiplying together all the factors that constitute each term, and arranging the series anew in such a manner, that each of its terms may be a power of \\( h \\), multiplied by a coefficient composed only of the powers of \\( b \\), and given numbers;\n\nAccordingly we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nhb &= b^2 \\\\\n\\frac{h(h-1)}{2}b^2 &= \\frac{b^3}{2} + \\frac{b^2}{2} \\\\\n\\frac{h(h-1)(h-2)}{2 \\cdot 3}b^3 &= \\frac{b^4}{3} + \\frac{b^3}{2} + \\frac{b^2}{6} \\\\\n&\\&c.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, by taking the sum of all the quantities on each side of these equations, we get the series,\n\n\\[\n1 + hb + \\frac{h(h-1)}{2}b^2 + \\frac{h(h-1)(h-2)}{2 \\cdot 3}b^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\notherwise expressed thus,\n\n\\[\n1 + A h + B h^2 + C h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A \\) is equal to the infinite series \\( b - \\frac{b^2}{2} + \\frac{b^3}{3} - \\frac{b^4}{4} + \\&c. \\)\n\nthat is, to\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a-1}{1} = \\frac{(a-1)^2}{2} + \\frac{(a-1)^3}{3} - \\frac{(a-1)^4}{4} + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nand \\( B, C, \\&c. \\) are also quantities composed of the powers of \\( b \\), and consequently are independent of \\( h \\); but as these are all to disappear in the course of the investigation, it is not necessary to express them otherwise, than by a general symbol. Therefore, we have now got\n\n\\[\na^b = 1 + A h + B h^2 + C h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nand consequently,\n\n\\[\nu' - u = a^x (a^b - 1) = a^x (A h + B h^2 + C h^3 + \\&c.)\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\frac{u' - u}{h} = A a^x + B a^x h + C a^x h^2 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nHence, when \\( h \\) is conceived to be continually diminished, we have the limit of \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\), expressed by \\( A a^x \\), and therefore \u00a7 21,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{u'}{x} = A a^x, \\text{ and } u = A a^x.\n\\]\n\n54. In the preceding investigation, we have had occasion to develop the exponential expression \\( a^b \\) into a series of this form,\n\n\\[\n1 + A h + B h^2 + C h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nthat is, a series the terms of which are the successive powers of the exponent, each multiplied by a coefficient, which is independent of the exponent.\n\nWe have however only determined the coefficients of the first two terms of the series, these being the only ones we had occasion to employ.\n\nThe result of the investigation however may be applied to determine all the coefficients by the very same kind of process as that which we have employed in \u00a7 53, to determine the coefficients of the terms of the series which constitutes the other expansion of \\( a^b \\).\n\nInstead of denoting the exponent by \\( h \\), let us consider it as a variable quantity, and express it by \\( x \\), then, from what has been shewn it appears that\n\n\\[\na^x = 1 + A x + B x^2 + C x^3 + D x^4 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A, B, C, \\&c. \\) express constant quantities. Let the operation of taking the fluxions be now performed on both sides of this equation, (observing that the fluxion of \\( a^x \\) is \\( A a^x \\)) and let all the terms be divided by \\( x \\), which is common to each, thus we obtain\n\n\\[\nA a^x = A + 2B x + 3C x^2 + 4D x^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nand, dividing by \\( A \\),\n\n\\[\na^x = 1 + 2 \\frac{B}{A} x + 3 \\frac{C}{A} x^2 + 4 \\frac{D}{A} x^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nLet the coefficients of the same powers of \\( x \\) in each of the two series expressing \\( a^x \\) be put equal to each other, then,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2B}{A} = A, \\text{ hence, } B = \\frac{A^2}{2},\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3C}{A} = B, \\text{ } \\frac{3C}{A} = \\frac{A^3}{2 \\cdot 3},\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4D}{A} = C, \\text{ } \\frac{4D}{A} = \\frac{A^4}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4},\n\\]\n\n\\&c.\n\nTherefore,\nTherefore, substituting these values of B, C, D, &c., in the original series, we have\n\n\\[ a^x = 1 + A x + \\frac{A^2 x^2}{2} + \\frac{A^3 x^3}{2 \\cdot 3} + \\frac{A^4 x^4}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} + \\ldots \\]\n\nthe same result as has been found in the article ALGEBRA, \u00a7 293, by proceeding in a different manner.\n\n55. If we suppose \\( x = 1 \\), then the preceding equation becomes\n\n\\[ a = 1 + A + \\frac{A^2}{2} + \\frac{A^3}{2 \\cdot 3} + \\frac{A^4}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} + \\ldots \\]\n\nand if we suppose \\( x = \\frac{1}{A} \\), it becomes\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{a} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3} + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} + \\ldots \\]\n\nthus the quantity \\( a^{\\frac{1}{A}} \\) is equal to a constant number which is the value of \\( a \\) when \\( A = 1 \\), and which, by taking the sum of the first ten terms of the series, is found to be \\( 2.7182818 \\), or, by taking the sum of a greater number of terms, more accurately\n\n\\[ 2.718281828459045\\ldots \\]\n\nWe shall, in the remainder of this treatise, denote this number always by \\( e \\), then \\( a^{\\frac{1}{A}} = e \\), and \\( a = e^A \\), and taking the logarithms, \\( \\log_a = A \\times \\log_e \\), hence\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{\\log_a}{\\log_e}. \\]\n\n56. If we now substitute this value of \\( A \\) in the expression for the fluxion of \\( u = a^x \\), found in \u00a7 53, it becomes\n\n\\[ \\dot{u} = \\frac{\\log_a}{\\log_e} \\cdot a^x \\cdot \\dot{x}. \\]\n\nHence it appears, that the fluxion of the function \\( ax \\) is equal to the fluxion of \\( x \\) multiplied by the function itself, and by the quotient arising from the division of the logarithm of \\( a \\) by the logarithm of \\( e \\), where \\( e \\) denotes \\( 1 + \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{1}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\frac{1}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} + \\ldots \\)\n\nseries whose sum is \\( 2.7182818 \\) nearly.\n\n57. Let us now consider the third simple function of \\( x \\), namely \\( u = \\log_x \\). Let \\( a \\) be the radical number of the particular system, in which \\( u \\) is a logarithm, and \\( x \\) the corresponding number; then from the nature of logarithms (see ALGEBRA, \u00a7 277), we have \\( a^u = x \\). Now, whether we consider \\( u \\) as a function of \\( x \\), or \\( x \\) as a function of \\( u \\), the limiting ratio of their simultaneous increments, and consequently the ratio of their fluxions will be the very same. But by considering \\( x \\) as a function of \\( u \\), we have immediately, from what has been shown in \u00a7 53, and \u00a7 55,\n\n\\[ \\frac{dx}{du} = A \\cdot a^x = Ax, \\]\n\nand therefore, \\( \\dot{u} = \\frac{1}{A} \\cdot \\log_a \\cdot \\dot{x} \\), but as \\( a \\) is the radical number of the system, \\( \\log_a = 1 \\), therefore\n\n\\[ \\dot{u} = \\log_e \\cdot \\dot{x}. \\]\n\nThe number which we have denoted by \\( e \\) occurs very often in analytical investigations; it is the radical number of the system of logarithms first invented by Baron Napier, and called by some writers Hyperbolic logarithms, but by others, with more propriety, Napierian logarithms.\n\nThe expression \\( \\frac{\\log_e}{\\log_a} \\) is called the modulus of the system of logarithms whose radical number is \\( a \\). In the Napierian system \\( \\frac{\\log_e}{\\log_a} = \\log_e \\cdot \\log_e = 1 \\), that is, the modulus is unity; but in the common system, or that in which \\( a = 10 \\), the modulus \\( \\frac{\\log_e}{\\log_a} = 0.434294482 \\). The rule for finding the fluxion of the logarithm of a variable quantity may now be expressed thus:\n\nMultiply the fluxion of the variable quantity by the modulus of the system, and divide the product by the variable quantity itself, the result is the fluxion required.\n\n58. By the application of the rule for finding the fluxion of the logarithm of a variable quantity we may readily find the fluxions of exponential functions in general. Thus, for example, if \\( u = y^x \\), \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) being both functions of any variable quantity \\( z \\), then \\( \\dot{u} = y \\times \\log_z \\times \\dot{z} \\); and taking the fluxions (considering \\( y \\times \\log_z \\) as the product of two functions \\( y \\) and \\( \\log_z \\), and proceeding by the rules of \u00a7 37 and last),\n\n\\[ \\dot{u} = y \\cdot \\log_z \\cdot \\dot{z} + y \\cdot \\frac{\\dot{z}}{z}, \\]\n\nand hence\n\n\\[ \\dot{u} = n \\left( y \\cdot \\log_z \\cdot \\dot{z} + y \\cdot \\frac{\\dot{z}}{z} \\right), \\]\n\n\\[ = z^y \\left( y \\cdot \\log_z \\cdot \\dot{z} + y \\cdot \\frac{\\dot{z}}{z} \\right). \\]\n\n59. We are next to consider the functions \\( u = \\sin x \\) and \\( u = \\cos x \\).\n\nSuppose \\( x \\) to change its value, and to become \\( x + h \\), and \\( u \\) to become \\( u' \\), then, since\n\n\\[ u = \\sin x, \\text{ and } u' = \\sin (x + h), \\]\n\n\\[ u' - u = \\sin (x + h) - \\sin x; \\]\n\nbut by the arithmetic of sines (see ALGEBRA, \u00a7 353),\n\n\\[ \\sin (x + h) = \\sin x \\cdot \\cos h + \\cos x \\cdot \\sin h, \\text{ therefore, } \\]\n\n\\[ u' - u = \\cos x \\cdot \\cos h + \\cos x \\cdot \\sin h - \\sin x, \\]\n\n\\[ = \\cos x \\cdot \\sin h - \\sin x \\cdot (1 - \\cos h). \\]\n\nIn this case, as when treating formerly of other functions, we might consider the above expression for \\( u' - u \\), as resolvable into a series \\( p h + q h^2 + \\ldots \\) proceeding by the powers of the increment, and thence we might\nmight find the limit of \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\) as before. But we may discover the limit otherwise, by proceeding as follows;\n\nBecause\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 h = 1 - \\cos^2 h = (1 + \\cos h)(1 - \\cos h)\n\\]\n\ntherefore,\n\n\\[\n1 - \\cos h = \\frac{\\sin^2 h}{1 + \\cos h}\n\\]\n\nLet this value of \\( 1 - \\cos h \\) be substituted in the expression for \\( u' - u \\), and it becomes\n\n\\[\nu' - u = \\cos x \\sin h - \\frac{\\sin x \\sin^2 h}{1 + \\cos h}\n\\]\n\nAnd hence, dividing by \\( h \\), and arranging the terms so as to exhibit the ratio \\( \\frac{\\sin h}{h} \\), we get\n\n\\[\n\\frac{u' - u}{h} = \\frac{\\sin h}{h} \\left\\{ \\cos x \\cdot \\frac{\\sin h \\sin x}{1 + \\cos h} \\right\\}\n\\]\n\nConceive now \\( h \\) to be continually diminished, and we shall have the limit of \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\) equal to the limit of \\( \\frac{\\sin h}{h} \\) multiplied by the limit of the following expression\n\n\\[\n\\cos x \\cdot \\frac{\\sin h \\sin x}{1 + \\cos h}\n\\]\n\nNow, the sine of an arch being less than the arch itself, we have \\( \\frac{\\sin h}{h} < 1 \\). Again, the arch being less than its tangent, \\( \\frac{\\sin h}{h} > \\frac{\\tan h}{h} \\); but \\( \\tan h = \\frac{\\sin h}{\\cos h} \\)\n\nand therefore \\( \\frac{\\sin h}{\\tan h} = \\cos h \\); consequently \\( \\frac{\\sin h}{h} > \\cos h \\). Hence it appears, that the expression for the ratio \\( \\frac{\\sin h}{h} \\) is less than 1, or radius, but greater than \\( \\cos h \\). But \\( h \\) being conceived to be continually diminished, \\( \\cos h \\) continually approaches to 1, and may come nearer to it than by any assignable difference; therefore, the limit of \\( \\frac{\\sin h}{h} \\) is 1. As to the other expression, \\( \\cos x \\cdot \\frac{\\sin h \\sin x}{1 + \\cos h} \\); when \\( h \\) is supposed to be continually diminished, its second term, to wit, \\( \\frac{\\sin h \\sin x}{1 + \\cos h} \\) may become less than any assignable quantity; therefore the limit of the expression is simply \\( \\cos x \\); thus, upon the whole, we have found that the limit of \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\) is \\( \\cos x \\), and therefore\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\cos x, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\dot{x} = \\dot{x} \\cos x\n\\]\n\nThe fluxion of the other function, \\( u = \\cos x \\), is easily deduced from that which we have just found, by proceeding thus:\n\nPut \\( c \\) to denote a quadrant, then \\( \\cos x = \\sin(c - x) \\), and therefore\n\n\\[\nu = \\sin(c - x)\n\\]\n\nNow, it has been just shewn that\n\n\\[\n\\text{flux. of } \\sin(c - x) = \\cos(c - x) \\times \\text{flux. of } (c - x)\n\\]\n\nbut \\( \\cos(c - x) = \\sin x \\), and the fluxion of \\( c - x \\) is \\( \\dot{x} \\),\n\ntherefore\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = -x \\sin x\n\\]\n\nThus it appears, that the fluxion of the sine of a variable arch is equal to the fluxion of the arch multiplied by its cosine; and that the fluxion of the cosine is equal to the fluxion of the arch (taken with a negative sign) multiplied by the sine.\n\n60. We can now very readily find the fluxion of any other function of an arch of a circle. Thus, suppose \\( u = \\tan x \\); then, because \\( \\tan x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} \\), we have \\( u = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} \\). This expression being considered as a fractional function of \\( x \\), we have, by \u00a7 39, and what has been just now shewn,\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{\\dot{x} \\cos^2 x + \\dot{x} \\sin^2 x}{\\cos^2 x}\n\\]\n\nor, since \\( \\cos^2 x + \\sin^2 x = 1 \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{\\cos x} = \\sec x \\),\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\cos^2 x} = \\dot{x} \\sec^2 x\n\\]\n\nHence also we have \\( \\dot{x} = \\frac{\\dot{u}}{\\sec^2 x} = \\frac{\\dot{u}}{1 + \\dot{u}^2} \\).\n\nIn like manner, if we suppose \\( u = \\sec x \\), then, because \\( \\sec x = \\frac{1}{\\cos x} \\), we have \\( u = \\frac{1}{\\cos x} \\), and\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{\\dot{x} \\sin x}{\\cos^2 x}\n\\]\n\nor, since \\( \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} = \\tan x \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{\\cos x} = \\sec x \\),\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\tan x \\sec x\n\\]\n\nProceeding in this manner, we find that when \\( u = \\cotan x \\), then\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{-\\dot{x}}{\\tan^2 x \\cos^2 x} = \\frac{-\\dot{x}}{\\tan^2 x}\n\\]\n\nAnd when \\( u = \\cosec x \\), then\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{-\\dot{x} \\cos x}{\\sin^2 x} = \\frac{-\\dot{x} \\cotan x \\cosec x}{\\sin^2 x}\n\\]\n\n61. Let us now consider the fluxions of geometrical plane magnitudes: And first let it be required to find the expression for the fluxion of BDPC the area bounded fig. 1. by CP, a curve line, and by CB, PD, the ordinates at its extremities, and BD, the portion of AE, the line of the abscissas, which lies between those ordinates. Let the numerical measures of AD and PD, the co-ordinates at the point P, be denoted by \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), and the numerical measure of the area BDPC by \\( s \\); then\nthen \\( y \\) and \\( x \\) may both be considered as functions of the abscissa \\( x \\).\n\nLet \\( x \\), or \\( AD \\), be supposed to change its value, and to become \\( AD' \\), and let \\( DP' \\) and \\( BD'PC \\) be the corresponding new values of \\( y \\) and \\( s \\); then \\( DD' \\) and \\( DD'P'P \\) will be the geometrical expressions for the simultaneous increments of the abscissa and area. But, as one of these quantities is a line, and the other a space, they cannot be compared in respect of their ratio. Therefore, let us consider \\( a \\) as denoting a line whose numerical value is unity, and then the numerical values of the increments of the abscissa and area may be considered as analogous to the geometrical quantities \\( DD' \\times a \\), and the area \\( DD'P'P \\) respectively, which quantities being homogeneous may now be compared with each other. We are now to investigate the limit of\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{area } DD'P'P}{a \\times DD'}\n\\]\n\nthe general expression for the ratio of the increments of \\( s \\) and \\( x \\). Draw \\( PM \\) and \\( PN \\) parallel to \\( AE \\), meeting the ordinates in \\( M \\) and \\( N \\). The curvilinear area \\( DD'P'P \\) is greater than the rectangle \\( DD'MP \\), that is greater than \\( PD \\times DD' \\); but less than the rectangle \\( DD'PN \\), that is, less than \\( PD' \\times DD' \\), therefore\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{area } DD'P'P}{a \\times DD'} > \\frac{PD \\times DD'}{a \\times DD'} > \\frac{PD'}{a}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{area } DD'P'P}{a \\times DD'} < \\frac{PD' \\times DD'}{a \\times DD'} < \\frac{PD'}{a}\n\\]\n\nBut the increments being supposed to be continually diminished, \\( \\frac{PD}{a} \\) is the limit of \\( \\frac{PD'}{a} \\), therefore \\( \\frac{PD}{a} \\) is also the limit of \\( \\frac{\\text{area } DD'P'P}{a \\times DD'} \\), and hence (\u00a7 21.)\n\n\\[\n\\frac{s}{x} = \\frac{PD}{a} = \\frac{y}{1} = y, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\dot{s} = \\dot{y} \\dot{x}.\n\\]\n\nThat is, the fluxion of a curvilinear area is equal to the product of the ordinate, and the fluxion of the abscissa.\n\n62. Before we proceed to investigate the expression for the fluxion of an arch of a curve, it is necessary that we should inquire what is the limiting ratio of an arch of a curve to its chord.\n\nLet \\( APB \\) be any curve line, all the parts of which are concave towards its chord \\( AP \\). Let \\( AQ, QP \\) be tangents at the extremities of the arch, and let \\( aq \\rho \\) be a triangle similar to \\( APQ \\), but having its base \\( ap \\) of a given magnitude, then\n\n\\[\nAQ + QP : AP :: aq + q \\rho : ap.\n\\]\n\nSuppose now the point \\( P \\) to approach to \\( A \\), then the angles at \\( A \\) and \\( P \\), and consequently the angles at \\( a \\) and \\( \\rho \\), which are equal to them, will decrease, and may become less than any assignable angles; therefore, the limit of the ratio of \\( aq + q \\rho \\) to \\( ap \\) is evidently a ratio of equality; hence also the limit of the ratio of \\( AQ + QP \\) to \\( AP \\) is the ratio of equality; and since the arch \\( AP \\) is less than \\( AQ + QP \\), but greater than its chord \\( AP \\), the limit of the arch \\( AP \\) to its chord \\( AP \\) must also be the ratio of equality.\n\n63. We proceed now to find the fluxion of an arch of a curve. Let \\( APP' \\) be a curve line of any kind, and \\( AB, BP \\) any two co-ordinates at a point \\( P \\) in the curve. Put \\( x \\) for \\( AB \\), the abscissa, \\( y \\) for \\( BP \\), the ordinate, and \\( z \\) for the curve line \\( AP \\), then \\( z \\) and \\( y \\) may be considered as each a function of \\( x \\). Draw \\( P'B' \\) another ordinate, and draw \\( PM \\) parallel to \\( AB \\), meeting \\( P'B' \\) in \\( M \\); and draw the chord \\( PP' \\); then \\( PM, MP' \\) and the arch \\( PP' \\) are the simultaneous increments of \\( x, y, \\) and \\( z \\) respectively. Now we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{arch } PP'}{PM} = \\frac{\\text{arch } PP'}{\\text{chord } PP'} \\times \\frac{\\text{chord } PP'}{PM}.\n\\]\n\nBut chord \\( PP' = \\sqrt{(PM^2 + MP'^2)} = PM \\sqrt{(1 + \\frac{MP'^2}{PM^2})} \\);\n\ntherefore,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{arch } PP'}{PM} = \\frac{\\text{arch } PP'}{\\text{chord } PP'} \\times \\sqrt{(1 + \\frac{MP'^2}{PM^2})}.\n\\]\n\nSuppose now the increments to be continually diminished, then, as \\( \\frac{z}{x} = \\text{limit of } \\frac{\\text{arch } PP'}{PM} \\), and \\( \\frac{y^2}{x^2} = \\text{limit of } \\frac{\\text{chord } PP'}{\\text{chord } PP'} \\) (inf. \u00a7) we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{z}{x} = \\sqrt{(1 + \\frac{y^2}{x^2})}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\dot{z} = \\sqrt{(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2)}.\n\\]\n\nHence it appears that the square of the fluxion of a curve line of any kind is equal to the sum of the squares of the fluxions of the co-ordinates.\n\n64. The expression for the fluxion of a solid may be found by the same mode of reasoning as that which we have employed, \u00a7 61., to find the fluxion of a curvilinear area. Let \\( APQP \\) be a portion of a solid generated by the revolution of \\( APB \\), a curve line, about \\( AC \\), a line taken in the plane of the curve, as an axis. Let \\( PD \\rho, P'D' \\rho' \\) be the lines in which \\( BA \\rho \\), a plane passing along the axis \\( AC \\), meets \\( PQ \\rho, P'Q' \\rho' \\), the planes of two circles formed by sections of the solid perpendicular to its axis. Draw \\( PM \\) and \\( PN \\) parallel to \\( AD \\). Put \\( AD = x, DP = y \\), let \\( s \\) denote the solid \\( APQP \\), having \\( y \\) for the radius of its circular base, and \\( x \\) for its altitude; put \\( \\pi \\) for the number \\( 3^{14159} \\), viz. the circumference of a circle having its diameter \\( = 1 \\), and let \\( a \\) denote an area, having its numerical measure expressed by unity; then, \\( DD', \\) or \\( a \\times DD' \\) being considered as the increment of \\( x \\), the portion of the solid comprehended between the parallel planes \\( PQ \\rho, P'Q' \\rho' \\) will be the corresponding increment of \\( s \\), which we are to consider as a function of \\( x \\); hence (\\$ 21.) \\( \\frac{s}{x} \\) is equal to the limiting ratio of the portion of the solid, comprehended between the planes \\( PQ \\rho, P'Q' \\rho' \\) to the solid \\( a \\times DD' \\). But the former of these solids being evidently greater than a cylinder \\( Pm \\), having the circle \\( PQ \\rho \\) for its base, and \\( DD' \\) for its altitude, that is greater than \\( \\pi PD^2 \\times DD' \\), and less than a cylinder \\( N \\rho' \\), having the circle \\( P'Q' \\rho' \\) for its base, and \\( DD' \\) for its altitude, that is less than \\( \\pi P'D'^2 \\times DD' \\);\nDirect Method. It follows, that as long as DD' has an assignable magnitude,\n\n\\[ \\frac{s}{x} > \\pi PD' \\times DD' \\times \\frac{1}{a \\times DD'} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{s}{x} > \\frac{\\pi PD'^2}{a} \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ \\frac{s}{x} < \\pi P'D'^2 \\times DD' \\times \\frac{1}{a \\times DD'} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{s}{x} < \\frac{\\pi P'D'^2}{a} \\]\n\nbut the increment DD' being continually diminished, \\( \\frac{\\pi P'D'^2}{a} \\), the greater limit of \\( \\frac{s}{x} \\) approaches continually to its lesser limit \\( \\frac{\\pi y^2}{a} = \\frac{\\pi y^2}{a} \\) (because \\( a = 1 \\)) \\( \\pi y^2 \\),\n\nso as to come nearer to it than by any assignable difference, therefore \\( \\frac{s}{x} = \\pi y^2 \\), and \\( s = \\pi y^2 x \\). Now, if we observe that \\( \\pi y^2 \\) is the area of the circle PQ, it will appear, that the fluxion of a solid generated by the revolution of a curve about its axis is equal to the fluxion of the axis multiplied by the general expression for the area of a circle formed by supposing the solid to be cut by a plane perpendicular to its axis.\n\n65. To find the fluxion of the surface of the solid, let us denote that surface by \\( s \\), and let \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) denote as before; then the surface contained between the circles PQ and P'Q' will be the increment of \\( s \\), corresponding to DD' the increment of \\( x \\). Draw the chord PP'; then, the curve line PP' being supposed to revolve about the axis AC, and thus to generate the increment of the surface of the solid, the chord PP' will generate at the same time the convex surface of a frustum of a cone; now the limiting ratio of the curve line PP' to its chord PP' being the ratio of equality, the limiting ratio of the surfaces generated by the revolution of those lines will also be the ratio of equality; therefore \\( \\frac{s}{x} \\), which is equal to the limit of\n\n\\[ \\text{surf. gener. by arch PP'} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{x \\times DD'} \\]\n\nwill also be equal to the limit of\n\n\\[ \\text{surf. gener. by chord PP'} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{DD'}{DD'} \\]\n\nbut the convex surface of a frustum of a cone is equal to the product of its slant side into half the sum of the circumferences of its two bases (see Geometry), and in the present case these circumferences are equal to \\( 2 PD \\times \\pi \\), and \\( 2 P'D' \\times \\pi \\), therefore \\( \\frac{s}{x} \\) is equal to the limit of\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\pi (PD + P'D') PP'}{DD'} = \\pi (PD + P'D') \\frac{PP'}{DD'} \\]\n\nbut the point D' being supposed to approach to D, the limit of \\( PD + P'D' \\), will manifestly be \\( 2 PD = 2 y \\); and since\n\n\\[ \\frac{PP'}{DD'} = \\sqrt{(DD'^2 + P'M^2)} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{DD'}{DD'} = \\sqrt{(1 + \\frac{P'M^2}{DD'^2})} \\]\n\nthe limit of this expression (if we consider that P'M and DD' are the simultaneous increments of \\( y \\) and \\( x \\)) is evidently equal to \\( \\sqrt{(1 + \\frac{y^2}{x^2})} \\), therefore\n\n\\[ \\frac{s}{x} = 2 \\pi y \\sqrt{(1 + \\frac{y^2}{x^2})} \\]\n\nand consequently\n\n\\[ s = 2 \\pi y \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)} \\]\n\nIf we now observe that \\( 2 \\pi y \\) is the circumference of the circle PQ, and \\( \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)} \\) is the fluxion of the curve line AP, \u00a7 63, it will appear, that the fluxion of the surface of a solid generated by the revolution of a curve about its axis is equal to the fluxion of the curve line multiplied by the general expression for the circumference of a circle formed by supposing the curve to be cut by a plane perpendicular to its axis.\n\nSect. III. The Application of the Direct Method of Fluxions.\n\nHaving explained the principles of the direct method of fluxions at as great a length as we think suitable to the work of which this treatise forms a part, we proceed to show how the calculus may be applied to the resolution of some general problems in Analysis and Geometry.\n\nInvestigation of a general formula for expanding a Function into a Series.\n\n66. In treating of the principles of the method of fluxions, we have from an examination of particular functions, inferred by induction, that \\( u \\) being any function of a variable quantity \\( x \\), which was either actually expressed, or capable of being expressed by a combination of the powers of \\( x \\), then, \\( x \\) being supposed to change its value, and to become \\( x + h \\), the new value which the function \\( u \\) will acquire when \\( x + h \\) is substituted in it instead of \\( x \\) will always be capable of being expanded into a series of this form,\n\n\\[ u + p h + q h^2 + r h^3 + &c. \\]\n\nwhere \\( p, q, &c. \\) denote functions of \\( x \\) that are quite independent of \\( h \\).\n\nWe have shewn that, from the particular form of this development, it happens that the ratio of \\( p h + q h^2 + r h^3 + &c. \\) the increment of the function, to \\( h \\) the increment of the variable quantity \\( x \\) itself, admits of a limit, which is always expressed by \\( p \\), the coefficient of its second term; and as we have defined this limit to be the expression for the ratio of the fluxions of \\( u \\) and \\( x \\), so that \\( p = \\frac{u}{x} \\), the new value of the function may also be expressed thus\n\n\\[ u + \\frac{u}{x} h + q h^2 + r h^3 + &c. \\]\nAnd this expression may be considered as indicating not only the general form of the series, but also the particular relation subsisting between \\( u \\), the original function, and \\( p \\), the coefficient of the second term of the series, the latter being in every case that function of \\( x \\) which results from the operation of taking the fluxion of the former, and dividing by \\( x \\).\n\nWe are now to investigate the relation that fulfills between each of the remaining coefficients and the original function.\n\n67. First let us suppose the function \\( u \\) to have the particular form \\( x^n \\), \\( n \\) being a constant number. When \\( x \\) changing its value to \\( x + h \\), \\( u \\) changes to \\( u' = (x + h)^n \\), therefore, by the binomial theorem (\\$52),\n\n\\[\nu' = x^n + nx^{n-1}h + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}x^{n-2}h^2 + \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3!}x^{n-3}h^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nBut since \\( u = x^n \\), by taking the successive fluxions of \\( u \\), and considering \\( x \\) as constant, we have,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{u}{x} &= nx^{n-1}, \\\\\n\\frac{u}{x^2} &= n(n-1)x^{n-2}, \\\\\n\\frac{u}{x^3} &= n(n-1)(n-2)x^{n-3}, \\\\\n\\frac{u}{x^4} &= n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)x^{n-4}, \\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nLet \\( u, \\frac{u}{x}, \\frac{u}{x^2}, \\ldots \\) be now substituted for \\( x^n, nx^{n-1}, n(n-1)x^{n-2}, \\ldots \\) respectively, in the series for \\( u' \\), and we have\n\n\\[\nu' = u + \\frac{u}{x}h + \\frac{u}{x^2}h^2 + \\frac{u}{x^3}h^3 + \\frac{u}{x^4}h^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\n68. This manner of expressing the development of \\( u' \\), or \\( (x + h)^n \\), indicates directly the relation that each of the coefficients of the successive powers of \\( h \\) has to the original function.\n\nThe first term of the series is the original function \\( u \\), or \\( x^n \\) itself, or it is what the function \\( (x + h)^n \\) becomes upon the supposition that \\( h = 0 \\). The second term is \\( h \\), or \\( \\frac{h}{1} \\), multiplied by the coefficient \\( \\frac{u}{x} \\), which coefficient is a function of \\( x \\) derived from the original function by the operation of taking its fluxion, and dividing the result by \\( x \\). The third term is \\( \\frac{h^2}{1 \\cdot 2} \\) multiplied by the coefficient \\( \\frac{u}{x^2} \\), that is, by a function of \\( x \\) derived from the preceding coefficient \\( \\frac{u}{x} \\) by the same operation as that coefficient was derived from the original function, namely by taking the fluxion of \\( \\frac{u}{x} \\), considering \\( x \\) as constant, and dividing by \\( x \\). The fourth term is \\( \\frac{h^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} \\) multiplied by \\( \\frac{u}{x^3} \\), that is, by a function of \\( x \\) deduced from the third coefficient by the very same operation as that by which the third was derived from the second, or the second from the first. And so on with respect to all the other terms of the series, the \\( n \\)th term being the product of \\( \\frac{h^{n-1}}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots (n-1)} \\), and the \\( (n-1) \\)th fluxion of the function \\( u \\) divided by \\( x^{n-1} \\).\n\n69. Let us now suppose that \\( u \\) denotes any other function of \\( x \\), then, whatever be its nature, it may always be conceived as capable of being expressed by a series, the terms of which are powers of \\( x \\), in this manner;\n\n\\[\nA x^a + B x^b + C x^c + D x^d + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A, B, C, \\ldots \\) denote constant numbers. Thus we have\n\n\\[\nu = A x^a + B x^b + C x^c + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nThen, \\( x \\) being supposed to become \\( x + h \\), and (in consequence of the change in the value of \\( x \\)) \\( u \\) to become \\( u' \\), we have\n\n\\[\nu' = A (x + h)^a + B (x + h)^b + C (x + h)^c + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nLet us now denote \\( A x^a \\) by \\( P \\), \\( B x^b \\) by \\( Q \\), \\( C x^c \\) by \\( R \\), &c., then by last \u00a7\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nA (x + h)^a &= P + \\frac{P}{x}h + \\frac{P}{x^2}h^2 + \\frac{P}{x^3}h^3 + \\ldots \\\\\nB (x + h)^b &= Q + \\frac{Q}{x}h + \\frac{Q}{x^2}h^2 + \\frac{Q}{x^3}h^3 + \\ldots \\\\\nC (x + h)^c &= R + \\frac{R}{x}h + \\frac{R}{x^2}h^2 + \\frac{R}{x^3}h^3 + \\ldots \\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, substituting these developments in the series expressing \\( u' \\),\n\n\\[\nu' = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{l}\nP + Q + R + \\ldots \\\\\n+ \\left( \\frac{P}{x} + \\frac{Q}{x} + \\frac{R}{x} + \\ldots \\right) h \\\\\n+ \\left( \\frac{P}{x^2} + \\frac{Q}{x^2} + \\frac{R}{x^2} + \\ldots \\right) \\frac{h^2}{2} \\\\\n+ \\left( \\frac{P}{x^3} + \\frac{Q}{x^3} + \\frac{R}{x^3} + \\ldots \\right) \\frac{h^3}{2 \\cdot 3} \\\\\n+ \\ldots\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\]\nBut\n\n\\[ u = P + Q + R + \\&c. \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} = \\frac{\\dot{P}}{x} + \\frac{\\dot{Q}}{x} + \\frac{\\dot{R}}{x} + \\&c. \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2} = \\frac{\\ddot{P}}{x^2} + \\frac{\\ddot{Q}}{x^2} + \\frac{\\ddot{R}}{x^2} + \\&c. \\]\n\n\\&c.\n\nTherefore, substituting \\( u, \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x}, \\&c. \\) for the series to which they are respectively equal,\n\n\\[ u' = u + \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} \\cdot \\frac{h}{1} + \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2} \\cdot \\frac{h^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^3} \\cdot \\frac{h^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\&c. \\]\n\nHence it appears that \\( u \\) being any function of \\( x \\) whatever, if \\( x + h \\) be substituted in that function instead of \\( x \\), the series expressing the development of this new value of the function will have the general properties which have been thrown, in last \\( \\&c. \\) belong to it in the case of the function having the particular value \\( x^n \\).\n\nThe very general theorem which we have just now investigated is one of the most elegant and important in analysis. It was first published by Dr Brooke Taylor in a work entitled Methodus Incrementorum, which made its appearance about the year 1716. The theorem itself is generally known by the name of Taylor's theorem. It is more general than the celebrated Binomial theorem, inasmuch as this last, and innumerable others, are comprehended in it as particular cases.\n\n70. We shall now give some examples to shew the manner of applying Taylor's theorem, as well as its great utility as an instrument of analysis.\n\nExample 1. Suppose \\( u = a^x \\), \\( a \\) being constant and \\( x \\) variable. Then \\( x \\) becoming \\( x + h \\), \\( u \\) becomes \\( u' = a^{x+h} \\).\n\nNow from the equation \\( u = a^x \\) we derive (\\$ 56.)\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} = A \\cdot a^x \\] (here \\( A \\) denotes \\( \\log_a e \\)).\n\nAgain, considering \\( x \\) as constant, and repeating the operation of taking the fluxion on \\( \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} = A \\cdot a^x \\), we get \\( \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2} = A^2 \\cdot a^x \\), and hence again \\( \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2} = A^3 \\cdot a^x \\), \\&c. Therefore, substituting for \\( u', \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x}, \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2}, \\&c. \\) their values in the general theorem\n\n\\[ u' = u + \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} \\cdot \\frac{h}{1} + \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2} \\cdot \\frac{h^2}{2} + \\&c. \\] it becomes\n\n\\[ a^{x+h} = a^x \\left( 1 + A \\cdot h + \\frac{A^2}{2} \\cdot h^2 + \\frac{A^3}{2 \\cdot 3} \\cdot h^3 + \\&c. \\right) \\]\n\nSuppose now, that \\( x = 0 \\), then, as in this case \\( a^x = 1 \\), we have\n\n\\[ d^h = 1 + A \\cdot h + \\frac{A^2}{2} \\cdot h^2 + \\frac{A^3}{2 \\cdot 3} \\cdot h^3 + \\&c. \\]\n\nor, exchanging \\( h \\) for \\( x \\)\n\n\\[ a^x = 1 + A \\cdot x + \\frac{A^2}{2} \\cdot x^2 + \\frac{A^3}{2 \\cdot 3} \\cdot x^3 + \\&c. \\]\n\nthe same result as we formerly obtained in \u00a7 54.\n\nEx. 2. Suppose \\( u = \\log_x x \\). Then, \\( x \\) becoming \\( x + h \\), \\( u \\) becomes \\( u' = \\log_x (x + h) \\). Now from the equation \\( u = \\log_x x \\), we find (by \u00a7 57.) \\( \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} = \\frac{M}{x} \\).\n\nHere \\( M \\) denotes the modulus of the system. Again, supposing \\( x \\) constant, we find by \u00a7 26, \\( \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2} = -\\frac{M}{x^2} \\),\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^3} = -\\frac{2M}{x^3}, \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^4} = -\\frac{3M}{x^4} \\&c. \\]\n\nTherefore, substituting as before the values of \\( u', \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x}, \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2}, \\&c. \\) in the general formula \\( u' = u + \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} \\cdot \\frac{h}{1} + \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2} \\cdot \\frac{h^2}{2} + \\&c. \\) it becomes\n\n\\[ \\log_x (x + h) = \\log_x x + \\frac{M}{x} \\cdot \\frac{h}{1} - \\frac{M}{2x^2} \\cdot \\frac{h^2}{2} + \\frac{M}{3x^3} \\cdot \\frac{h^3}{3} + \\&c. \\]\n\nIf we suppose \\( x = 1 \\), and change \\( h \\) into \\( y \\), we have, because \\( \\log_1 x = \\log_1 x = 0 \\),\n\n\\[ \\log_1 (1 + y) = M \\left( y - \\frac{y^2}{2} + \\frac{y^3}{3} - \\&c. \\right) \\]\n\nFor the particular method of applying these two series to the calculation of logarithms, see Algebra \u00a7 285 to \u00a7 291. See also Logarithms.\n\nEx. 3. Suppose now \\( u = \\sin x \\). Then \\( u' = \\sin (x + h) \\). From \\( u = \\sin x \\), by the application of the rule in \u00a7 59, we deduce \\( \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} = \\cos x, \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2} = -\\sin x, \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^3} = -\\cos x, \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^4} = \\sin x, \\&c. \\)\n\nTherefore, substituting for \\( u', \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x}, \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2}, \\&c. \\) their values in the general formula as before, we have\n\n\\[ \\sin (x + h) = \\sin x + \\cos x \\cdot \\frac{h}{1} - \\sin x \\cdot \\frac{h^2}{1 \\cdot 2} - \\cos x \\cdot \\frac{h^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\&c. \\]\n\nor \\( \\sin (x + h) \\) is equal to\n\n\\[ \\sin x \\left( 1 - \\frac{h^2}{2} + \\frac{h^4}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} - \\&c. \\right) + \\cos x \\left( \\frac{h^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\frac{h^5}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5} - \\&c. \\right) \\]\n\nIf we suppose \\( x = 0 \\), then, as in that case \\( \\sin x = 0 \\), the preceding formula becomes\nNow, \\( u' \\) being the value that \\( u \\) assumes when \\( x + h \\) is substituted in it instead of \\( x \\), if we suppose \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( u' \\) becomes the very same function of \\( h \\) that \\( u \\) is of \\( x \\).\n\nLet us denote the values which each of the functions \\( u, \\frac{u}{x}, \\frac{u}{x^2}, \\ldots \\) acquire, when \\( x = 0 \\), by \\( U, U', U'' \\ldots \\) respectively.\n\nThen \\( (x) u' \\) (considered as the same function of \\( h \\) that \\( u \\) is of \\( x \\)) is equal to\n\n\\[\nU + U' \\frac{h}{1} + U'' \\frac{h^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + U''' \\frac{h^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nLet \\( x \\) be now supposed to be substituted both in \\( u' \\) and the series which is its development instead of \\( h \\); then \\( u' \\) becomes \\( u \\), and we have\n\n\\[\nu = U + U' \\frac{x}{1} + U'' \\frac{x^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + U''' \\frac{x^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nand in this formula it is to be considered, as already stated, that \\( U, U', U'' \\ldots \\) denote the particular values which the functions \\( u, \\frac{u}{x}, \\frac{u}{x^2}, \\ldots \\) acquire respectively, by supposing that in each of them \\( x \\) is taken \\( = 0 \\).\n\n72.

The theory of tangents to curve lines furnishes a good illustration of the truth of the principle which we have considered as the foundation of the method of fluxions, namely, that whatever be the form of a function, the ratio of its increment to the increment of the variable quantity from which the function is formed, is in every case susceptible of a limit.\n\nLet \\( AB \\), the abscissa of a curve, be the geometrical expression of a variable quantity \\( x \\), and let \\( BP \\) the corresponding ordinate, be the expression for \\( y \\), any function of \\( x \\); then the curve line itself is the locus of the equation expressing the relation between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Let \\( PT \\), a tangent to the curve at \\( P \\), meet \\( AB \\) the abscissa in \\( T \\); through \\( P \\) draw any straight line meeting the abscissa in \\( D \\), and the curve in \\( P \\); draw the ordinate \\( PB \\), and from \\( P \\) draw \\( PN \\) parallel to the abscissa, meeting the ordinate \\( BD \\) in \\( N \\).\n\nThe triangles \\( DBP, PN \\) are similar; therefore\n\n\\[\nPN : NP :: PB : BD.\n\\]\n\nNow \\( PN \\), and \\( NP \\), or \\( BB \\), are the increments of \\( PB \\) and \\( BA \\), or of \\( y \\) and \\( x \\) respectively, therefore the ratio of the simultaneous increments of \\( PB \\) and \\( BA \\), or \\( y \\) and \\( x \\), whatever be their magnitudes, is equal to the ratio of \\( PB \\) to \\( BD \\). Conceive now the point \\( P \\) to approach continually to \\( P \\), then the angle contained by the straight line \\( PD \\), and the tangent \\( PT \\), will decrease, and the point \\( D \\) will approach to \\( T \\); at the same time \\( NP \\), and \\( NP \\), the increments of \\( y \\) and \\( x \\) will be continually diminished; still, however, they will have to each other the ratio of \\( PB \\) to \\( BD \\), but this ratio approaches continually to the ratio of \\( PB \\) to \\( BT \\), and becomes at last more nearly equal to it than any assignable ratio; therefore the ratio of \\( PB \\) to \\( BT \\) is the limit of the ratio of \\( PB \\) to \\( BD \\), and consequently is also the limit of the ratio of \\( p \\) to \\( n \\), the increment of \\( y \\) to \\( n \\), the increment of \\( x \\). And as this conclusion does not depend upon the particular nature of the curve, or upon any particular relation supposed between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we may conclude, that whatever be the form of the function, the ratio of the simultaneous increments of the function, and the variable quantity from which it is formed, has a limit to which it approaches when the increments are conceived to be continually diminished.\n\nIt is now easy to see how the method of fluxions may be applied to the determination of tangents to curves, for since the ratio of the ordinate \\( PB \\) to the subtangent \\( BT \\) is always the limiting ratio of the increments of the ordinate and abscissa, it is equal to the ratio of their fluxions, that is\n\n\\[\n\\dot{y} : \\dot{x} :: y : \\text{subtan. } BT.\n\\]\n\nHence in any curve whatever, referred to an axis, the subtangent, (that is, the segment of the abscissa between the ordinate and tangent) is equal to \\( \\frac{\\dot{y}}{\\dot{x}} \\) where \\( x \\) denotes the abscissa, and \\( y \\) the ordinate at the point of contact; and the subtangent being found, the position of the tangent is thereby determined.\n\nLet us apply the above general formula to some examples.\n\nExample 1. Let the proposed curve be a circle. It is required to determine the position of \\( PT \\), a tangent Fig. 7- at any point \\( P \\) in its circumference.\n\nPut \\( 2a \\) for \\( AE \\) the diameter, also \\( x \\) for \\( AB \\) the abscissa, and \\( y \\) for \\( BP \\) the ordinate at the point of contact.\n\nFrom the nature of the curve, we have\n\n\\[\nAB \\times BE = BP^2, \\text{ that is }\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx(2a - x) = y^2.\n\\]\n\nHence taking the relations of the fluxions of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we have\n\n\\[\n2ax - 2x\\dot{x} = 2y\\dot{y},\n\\]\n\ntherefore \\( \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\dot{y}} = \\frac{y}{a-x}, \\)\n\nand \\( BT = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\dot{y}} = \\frac{y^2}{a-x}; \\)\n\nfrom which it appears that \\( BT \\) the subtangent is a third proportional to \\( a-x \\) and \\( y \\), that is, to \\( CB \\) the distance of the ordinate from the centre, and \\( BP \\) the ordinate, agreeing with what is known from the elements of geometry.\n\nEx. 2. Let the curve be a parabola, required the same as before.\n\nPut \\( x \\) for \\( AB \\), the abscissa, and \\( y \\) for \\( BP \\) the ordinate at \\( P \\) the point of contact; also \\( a \\) for the parameter; then, from the nature of the curve\n\n\\[\nPB^2 = a \\times AB, \\text{ that is }\n\\]\n\n\\[\nax = y^2,\n\\]\n\ntherefore...\ntherefore, taking the fluxions, we get \\( \\dot{x} = 2y \\), and\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{x}}{y} = \\frac{2y}{a}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nBT = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{y} y = \\frac{2y^2}{a} = \\frac{2ax}{a} = 2x;\n\\]\n\nfrom which it appears that the sub-tangent \\( BT \\) is double the abscissa \\( BA \\).\n\nEx. 3. Let the curve be an ellipse.\n\nPut \\( AB = x \\), \\( BP = y \\), \\( AC \\), the semi-transverse axis \\( = a \\), \\( CH \\) the semi-conjugate axis \\( = b \\).\n\nThe nature of the curve is such, that\n\n\\[\nAC^2 : CH^2 :: AB \\times BE : BP^2\n\\]\n\nor \\( a^2 : b^2 :: (2a - x)x : y^2 \\)\n\nHence \\( a^2 y^2 = b^2 (2a - x)x \\),\n\nand taking the relation of the fluxions,\n\n\\[\n\\dot{x} y \\dot{y} = b^2 (a - x) \\dot{x};\n\\]\n\nTherefore \\( \\frac{\\dot{x}}{y} = \\frac{a^2 y}{b^2 (a - x)} \\), and\n\n\\[\nBT = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{y} y = \\frac{a^2 y^2}{b^2 (a - x)}.\n\\]\n\nBut from the preceding equation expressing the nature of the curve, \\( \\frac{ay^2}{b^2} = (2a - x)x \\); therefore\n\n\\[\nBT = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{y} y = \\frac{(2a - x)x}{a - x}.\n\\]\n\nTo this expression for \\( BT \\), let \\( BC = a - x \\) be added, and we have\n\n\\[\nCT = a - x + \\frac{(2a - x)x}{a - x} = \\frac{a^2}{a - x};\n\\]\n\nfrom which it appears that \\( CB : CA :: CA : CT \\).\n\nEx. 4.

Suppose the curve \\( APD \\) to be a cycloid, of Fig. 11, which \\( AE \\) is the axis, and \\( AQE \\) a semicircle described on the axis as a diameter. Suppose \\( AC \\), the radius, to be unity; put \\( AB = x \\), \\( BP = y \\), and the arch \\( AQ = v \\); then, \\( AB = 1 - \\text{col. } v \\), and \\( BQ = \\text{fin. } v \\). Now, from the nature of the curve, \\( PB = \\text{arch } AQ + BQ \\); hence we have\n\n\\[\nx = 1 - \\text{col. } v, \\quad y = \\text{fin. } v,\n\\]\n\nand taking the fluxions, by \u00a7 59,\n\n\\[\n\\dot{x} = \\text{v fin. } v, \\quad \\dot{y} = \\text{v col. } v;\n\\]\n\ntherefore,\n\n\\[\nBT = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{y} y = \\frac{\\text{v fin. } v}{\\text{v col. } v} = \\frac{\\text{PB} \\times \\text{BQ}}{\\text{EB}};\n\\]\n\nbut from the nature of the circle \\( \\frac{\\text{BQ}}{\\text{EB}} = \\frac{\\text{AB}}{\\text{BQ}} \\), therefore, \\( BT = \\frac{\\text{PB} \\times \\text{AB}}{\\text{BQ}} \\), and consequently \\( BQ : BA :: BP : BT \\), from which it appears that if the chord \\( AQ \\) be drawn, the tangent \\( PT \\) is parallel to the chord \\( QA \\).\n\n74. If \\( PT \\) be a tangent to the curve \\( AP \\) at the point \\( P \\), and \\( PC \\) be drawn perpendicular to the tangent, meeting \\( AC \\) the axis of the curve in \\( C \\), then the line \\( PC \\) is called a normal to the curve at the point \\( P \\); and \\( BC \\), the distance between the ordinate and the extremity of the normal, is called the sub-normal.\n\nThe triangles \\( TBP \\), \\( BPC \\) being similar, we have\n\n\\[\nTB : BP :: BP : BC; \\quad \\text{or, since } TB : BP :: \\dot{x} : \\dot{y}, (\\$ 73)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\dot{x} : \\dot{y} :: y : BC, \\quad \\text{hence in any curve, BC the sub-normal}\n\\]\n\nis equal to \\( \\frac{y}{\\dot{x}} \\), and from this expression, we may find the sub-normal in the same way as we have found the sub-tangent in the examples of last \u00a7.\n\n75.

In like manner we have\n\n\\[\n\\dot{y} : \\dot{x} :: BP : BD :: CB : BP :: 1 : \\tan.

If a variable quantity be supposed to change its magnitude, then any function of that quantity will also change its magnitude. When the variable quantity is supposed to increase continually so as to acquire successively all degrees of magnitude, there are some functions of such a form, that they either increase continually, or decrease continually; but there are others again which either increase to a certain limit, after which they decrease; or else they decrease to a certain limit, after which they increase.\n\nIf, in consequence of the continual increase of a variable quantity, a function of that quantity first increases to a certain limit, and afterwards decreases, when it arrives at that limit it is then said to be a maximum. Or if it decrease to a certain limit, and afterwards increase, when it arrives at that limit, it is then said to be a minimum.\n\n77. Let us consider the function \\( y = b - (x-a)^2 \\). If we suppose \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( y = b - a^2 \\). Suppose now \\( x \\) to be at first very small, and to increase; then as \\( (x-a)^2 \\) will decrease, \\( y \\) will also increase, till \\( x \\) become \\( a \\), and then \\( y \\) will become \\( b \\), when it is a maximum; for \\( x \\) being supposed to become greater than \\( a \\), \\( y \\) will be less than \\( b \\). By supposing \\( x \\) to increase till \\( (x-a)^2 \\) become equal to \\( b \\), then \\( y \\) will decrease to \\( 0 \\); and \\( x \\) being still supposed to increase, \\( y \\) will become negative.\n\nLet us next suppose \\( y = b + (x-a)^2 \\). In this case when \\( x = 0 \\), \\( y = b + a^2 \\); as \\( x \\) increases, \\( (x-a)^2 \\) decreases, and consequently \\( y \\) decreases, till \\( x = a \\), and then \\( y = b \\), a minimum; for \\( x \\) becoming greater than \\( a \\), \\( y \\) becomes greater than \\( b \\).\n\n78. Every function that either increases or decreases continually has neither maximum nor minimum; for whatever value such a function may acquire, in the one case it may always have a greater, and in the other a less value.\n\nThe characteristic property of a maximum value of a function, by which it is made the object of analytical inquiry, consists in its being greater than the values immediately preceding, and also greater than the values immediately following it; and that of a minimum consists in its being less than the values immediately preceding, and also less than the values immediately following it.\n\nIn some cases a function may increase to a certain limit and then decrease, and afterwards increase again indefinitely; or the contrary. Hence it may happen that such a function may have values greater than its maximum or less than its minimum as they have been here defined. And indeed it is easy to conceive that a function may increase and decrease alternately several times; in such a case it must be considered as having several maxima and minima.\n\n79. Since \\( y \\) any function of a variable quantity \\( x \\) may be considered as the ordinate of a curve, of which \\( x \\) is the abscissa, it is evident that to determine the greatest or least value of such a function, we have only to seek the greatest or least ordinate of the curve which is the locus of the equation expressing the relation between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Let us suppose this curve to be \\( DPE \\), and that \\( AB \\) is the value of \\( x \\), corresponding to \\( BP \\), the maximum or minimum value of the ordinate \\( y \\); it is evident, that in the case of a maximum, the curve must be concave towards \\( AC \\), at least to a certain extent, on each side of the point \\( P \\), as in fig. 12, but that in the case of a minimum it must be convex towards \\( AC \\), as in fig. 13; and also, that in either case, if a straight line be drawn through \\( P \\) parallel to \\( AC \\), the curve must be wholly on one side of that line, to a certain extent on each side of the point \\( P \\), and therefore, that the line \\( PQ \\) must be a tangent to the curve at the point \\( P \\).\n\nNow when \\( PQ \\) a tangent to a curve at \\( P \\) (fig. 8) meets the axis in \\( T \\), it has been shewn, \u00a7 75, that \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\) is the expression for the tangent of the angle \\( T \\), radius being unity; but this angle vanishes, when \\( PQ \\), instead of meeting \\( AC \\), is parallel to it, as in fig. 12, and fig. 13; therefore, as in this case the tangent of the angle is \\( = 0 \\), we have \\( \\frac{y}{x} = 0 \\).\n\nHence it appears, that to determine the maximum or minimum of \\( y \\), a function of \\( x \\), we must find the fluxion of the function, and divide it by \\( x \\), and put the result equal to \\( 0 \\).\n\n80. We proceed to illustrate this rule by some examples.\n\nEx. 1. To divide a given number \\( a \\) into two such parts, that their product may be the greatest possible.\n\nLet \\( x \\) denote the one part, then \\( a-x \\) will be the other part, and \\( x(a-x) \\) the product of the two parts. Therefore, by the question\n\n\\[\ny = x(a-x) = ax - x^2, \\text{ a maximum},\n\\]\n\nhence, taking the fluxion of the function,\n\n\\[\n\\dot{y} = a - 2x, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\dot{y}}{x} = a - 2x,\n\\]\n\ntherefore, \\( a - 2x = 0 \\), and \\( x = \\frac{a}{2} \\).\n\nThus it appears that the product of the parts will be the greatest possible, when each is half the given number.\n\nEx. 2. To find the fraction which shall exceed its cube by the greatest quantity possible.\n\nLet \\( x \\) denote the fraction, then its cube is \\( x^3 \\), so that we have\n\n\\[\ny = x - x^3, \\text{ a maximum};\n\\]\n\ntherefore, taking the fluxion of the function,\n\n\\[\n\\dot{y} = 1 - 3x^2, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\dot{y}}{x} = 1 - 3x^2 = 0,\n\\]\n\nhence \\( 3x^2 = 1 \\), and \\( x = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} \\), the fraction required.\n\nEx. 3. To determine the greatest rectangle that can be inscribed in a given triangle.\n\nPut the base \\( AC \\) of the triangle \\( = b \\), and its altitude \\( BD = a \\), and let \\( B \\) \\( n \\), the altitude of the rectangle Fig. 14. \\( pqr \\), considered as variable, be denoted by \\( x \\), then, because\nbecause of the parallel lines AC, pq, it will be, as BD : AC :: Dn : pq, that is \\(a : b : a - x : pq\\), hence \\(pq = \\frac{b(a-x)}{a}\\), and the area of the rectangle, or \\(pq \\times Bn\\), will be \\(\\frac{b(a-x)x}{a}\\), therefore \\(y = \\frac{b(a-x)x}{a}\\) must be a maximum, and hence \\(y' = \\frac{ba - 2bx}{a} :\\) thus we have,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{ba - 2bx}{a} = 0,\n\\]\n\nand \\(ba - 2bx = 0\\), and \\(x = \\frac{a}{2}\\); hence it appears that the greatest inscribed rectangle is that whose altitude is half the altitude of the triangle.\n\n81. It is proper to observe that the value of a quantity, when a maximum or minimum may often be determined more readily by considering that any given multiple, or part of the function, likewise any power or root of it, must then be also a maximum or minimum. Thus in the preceding example, in which the function to be a maximum is \\(\\frac{b(a-x)x}{a}\\), we may reject the constant multiplier \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\), and then the function to be a maximum is \\(y = (a-x)x = ax - x^2\\), the fluxion of which being taken, we have \\(y' = ax - 2x\\) and \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = a - 2x = 0\\), hence \\(x = \\frac{a}{2}\\), the same value as before.\n\nEx. 4. Of all the right-angled plane triangles having the same given hypotenuse, to find that whose area is greatest.\n\nLet ABC be the triangle; put AB = a, and AC, the given hypotenuse, = a, then BC = \\(\\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)}\\), and consequently the area of the triangle is \\(\\frac{x^2(a^2 - x^2)}{4}\\), which being a maximum, its square \\(\\frac{x^2(a^2 - x^2)}{4}\\), also four times that square, or \\(x^2(a^2 - x^2)\\), will likewise be a maximum, therefore, \\(y = x^2(a^2 - x^2) = ax^3 - x^4\\), a max., hence \\(y' = 2ax^2 - 4x^3 = 0\\), and\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = 2ax^2 - 4x^3 = 0,\n\\]\n\nhence \\(2x^2 = a^2\\), and \\(x = a\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{2}}\\).\n\nEx. 5. To determine the greatest cylinder that can be inscribed in a given cone.\n\nPut AC the base of the cone = b, BH its altitude = a, and DF, the diameter of the end of the cylinder DIGF inscribed in the cone, = x. From the similar triangles BAC, BDF, we have AC : BH :: DF : BE, that is \\(b : a :: x : BE\\), hence \\(BE = \\frac{ax}{b}\\), and \\(EH = BH - BE = a - \\frac{ax}{b} = \\frac{ab - ax}{b}\\). Put c for the number .78539, then the area of the base of the cylinder is (by the Elements of Geometry) \\(c \\times DF^2\\), and its solid content \\(c \\times DF^2 \\times EH = \\frac{ca^3(b-x)}{b}\\), hence \\(\\frac{ca^3(b-x)}{b}\\) is to be a maximum, therefore, leaving out the constant multiplier \\(\\frac{ca}{b}\\), we have \\(y = x^2(b-x) = bx^2 - x^3\\), a maximum; taking now the fluxions, we get\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = 2bx - 3x^2, \\text{ and } \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 2b - 3x = 0,\n\\]\n\nhence \\(3x^2 = 2bx\\), and \\(x = \\frac{2b}{3}\\), and consequently HE = \\(\\frac{1}{3}BH\\).\n\nEx. 6. To find the sun's place in the ecliptic, when that part of the equation of time which arises from the obliquity of the ecliptic is a maximum.\n\nLet EQ be the equator, EC the ecliptic, S the sun's place, and SA his declination, then this part of the equation of time is the difference of the sun's longitude ES, and right ascension EA, turned into time. Put the arch ES = x, the arch EA = v, which is to be considered as a function of x, and put a for the cosine of the angle E = 23\u00b0 28'. Then, by Spherical Trigonometry, in the right-angled spherical triangle LAS, we have tan. EA = cot. EX tan. ES; therefore, to determine x we have tan. v = a tan. x, and \\(y = x - v\\), a maximum.\n\nFrom the second of these equations we get\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{v}{x} = 1 - \\frac{v}{x} = 0,\n\\]\n\nand from the first, by \u00a7 60,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v}{x} \\sec^2 v = ax \\sec^2 x, \\text{ and } \\frac{v}{x} = \\frac{a \\sec^2 x}{\\sec^2 v},\n\\]\n\ntherefore, \\(1 + \\frac{a \\sec^2 x}{\\sec^2 v} = 0\\), and \\(\\sec^2 v = a \\sec^2 x\\),\n\nor \\(1 + \\tan^2 v = a - a \\tan^2 x\\), but from the first equation \\(\\tan^2 v = a \\tan^2 x\\), therefore,\n\n\\[\n1 + a^2 \\tan^2 x = a + a \\tan^2 x,\n\\]\n\nor \\(a(a - 1) \\tan^2 x = a - 1\\),\n\nhence \\(\\tan x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}} = 1.04416\\), the tangent of 46\u00b0 14', the sun's longitude when this part of the equation is a maximum.\n\n83. We have deduced the rule of \u00a7 79. for determining when a function is a maximum, or minimum, from the consideration of curve lines. The whole theory of maxima and minima may however be explained in a manner purely analytical, as follows:\n\nLet us suppose that \\(y\\) is any function whatever of \\(x\\), and that \\(x\\) has acquired the value that produces the maximum or minimum of the function; then, if we suppose \\(x = h\\) and \\(x + h\\) to be substituted successively in the function instead of \\(x\\), the two resulting values ought to be both less than the maximum or both greater than the minimum value.\nLet us denote the value of the function that results from the substitution of \\( x - h \\) by \\( y \\) and that which results from the substitution of \\( x + h \\) by \\( y' \\), then by the theorem given in \u00a7 69,\n\n\\[\ny = y - \\frac{y}{x} h + \\frac{y}{x^2} h^2 + \\frac{y}{x^3} h^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny' = y + \\frac{y}{x} h + \\frac{y}{x^2} h^2 + \\frac{y}{x^3} h^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nIn each of these values, \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\), the coefficient of \\( h \\), must either be equal to some quantity, positive or negative, or else it must \\( = 0 \\). Let us suppose, if possible, that it is equal to some quantity, positive or negative; now as \\( h \\) may be conceived to be so small that the term \\( \\frac{y}{x} h \\),\n\nor any other term, shall exceed the sum of all the terms that follow it in each series, (n) if we suppose \\( h \\) to have such a value, then, because of the term \\( \\frac{y}{x} h \\) having the sign \u2014 in the one series, and + in the other, it follows that the one value of the function is greater, and the other less than \\( y \\), the maximum or minimum value: But this conclusion is inconsistent with the nature of a maximum or minimum, therefore \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\) cannot in the case of a maximum or minimum be equal to any positive or negative quantity whatever.\n\nIf however we assume \\( \\frac{y}{x} = 0 \\), so that the two values are,\n\n\\[\ny = y + \\frac{y}{x^2} h^2 + \\frac{y}{x^3} h^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny' = y + \\frac{y}{x^2} h^2 + \\frac{y}{x^3} h^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nthen as the second term \\( \\frac{y}{x^2} h^2 \\) has the same sign in both, when that term is greater than all the terms that follow\n\nit, we shall have both values greater than \\( y \\) when \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\) is positive, and both less when it is negative, the first case corresponding to a maximum, and the second to a minimum.\n\nHence, to determine the maximum or minimum of the function \\( y \\), it appears that we must take the fluxion of \\( y \\), and divide it by \\( x \\), and put the result equal to 0, which agrees with what was shown in \u00a7 79.\n\n84. Although in the case of a function admitting of a maximum or minimum we have always \\( \\frac{y}{x} = 0 \\), yet we must not conclude that conversely the one or the other of these has place every time that \\( \\frac{y}{x} = 0 \\). For if it happens that the value of \\( x \\) that renders \\( \\frac{y}{x} = 0 \\), causes also \\( \\frac{y}{x^2} \\) to vanish, without at the same time making \\( \\frac{y}{x^3} \\) to disappear, then we have\n\n\\[\ny = y - \\frac{y}{x^2} h^2 + \\frac{y}{x^3} h^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny' = y + \\frac{y}{x^2} h^2 + \\frac{y}{x^3} h^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nand as by giving a proper value to \\( h \\), \\( \\frac{y}{x^2} h^2 \\) may be rendered greater than the sum of all the following terms in each series, it follows, that \\( \\frac{y}{x^3} \\) being supposed to be any quantity either positive or negative, because of its sign being different in the two values, the one of them will be greater, and the other less than \\( y \\), the maximum or minimum value, which result is inconsistent with the nature of a maximum or minimum. If however \\( \\frac{y}{x^3} \\) be assumed \\( = 0 \\), then\n\n(d) If this should not appear sufficiently obvious, let\n\n\\[\nA + Bh + Ch^2 + Dh^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nbe such a series, where \\( A, B, C, D, \\ldots \\) denote quantities either positive or negative, but which are independent of \\( h \\). Then, writing the series thus,\n\n\\[\nh(A + Bh + Ch^2 + Dh^3 + \\ldots)\n\\]\n\nit is obvious that if \\( h \\) be conceived to be continually diminished, and at last to become \\( = 0 \\), the part\n\n\\[\nBh + Ch^2 + Dh^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwill also become \\( = 0 \\), therefore before it vanishes it will be less than \\( A \\), or any other assignable quantity, therefore \\( Bh + Ch^2 + Dh^3 + \\ldots \\) may become less than \\( A/h \\).\n\\[ y = y + \\frac{y}{x^4} \\cdot \\frac{h^4}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} + \\text{&c.} \\]\n\n\\[ y' = y + \\frac{y}{x^4} \\cdot \\frac{h^4}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} + \\text{&c.} \\]\n\nhere again, the coefficient of the second term having in both values the same sign, the conditions of the maximum or minimum are fulfilled, and the sign of \\( \\frac{y}{x^4} \\) shews when the one or the other is to have place.\n\nIt must now be sufficiently evident, without proceeding any further, that a function can only admit of a maximum or a minimum when the first of its fluxions that does not vanish, is of an even order (or is its second or fourth fluxion, &c.), and that the sign of that fluxion is negative in the case of a maximum, but positive in the case of a minimum.\n\n85. We shall conclude this theory by applying it to an example. Let \\( y \\) be such a function of \\( x \\) that\n\n\\[ y^2 - 2mxy + x^2 - a^2 = 0, \\]\n\nthen by \u00a7 49,\n\n\\[ (y - mx)y' - (my - x)x' = 0, \\]\n\nand hence\n\n\\[ \\frac{y'}{x} = \\frac{my - x}{y - mx} = 0, \\]\n\ntherefore \\( my - x = 0 \\), and \\( y = \\frac{x}{m} \\).\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), let this value of \\( y \\) be substituted in the original equation, it thus becomes\n\n\\[ x^2 - x^2 - a^2 = 0, \\]\n\nhence we find\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{ma}{\\sqrt{(1 - m^2)}}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{(1 - m^2)}}. \\]\n\nWe must now examine what is the nature of the expression for \\( \\frac{y}{x^2} \\). Taking the fluxion of the equation\n\n\\[ \\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{my - x}{y - mx}, \\]\n\nand considering that \\( x \\) is constant, we have\n\n\\[ \\frac{y'}{x} = \\frac{(1 - m^2)(xy - yx')}{(y - mx)^2}, \\]\n\ntherefore, dividing by \\( x \\),\n\n\\[ \\frac{y'}{x^2} = \\frac{x - m^2}{(y - mx)^2} \\left\\{ \\frac{y'}{x} - y \\right\\}, \\]\n\nbut as in the present case \\( \\frac{y'}{x} = 0 \\), and \\( y = \\frac{x}{m} \\), this expression becomes simply\n\n\\[ \\frac{y'}{x^2} = \\frac{-m}{x(1 - m^2)}, \\]\n\nwhich equation, by putting instead of \\( x \\) its value \\( \\frac{ma}{\\sqrt{(1 - m^2)}} \\), becomes\n\n\\[ \\frac{y'}{x^2} = \\frac{1}{a \\sqrt{(1 - m^2)}}, \\]\n\nand as this result is negative, we conclude that the value which we have found for \\( y \\) is a maximum.\n\nOf the values of fractions, the numerators and denominators of which vanish at the same time.\n\n86. There are some fractional functions of such a nature, that by giving a particular value to the variable quantity, both the numerator and denominator of the fraction vanish, and thus the fraction is reduced to this form \\( \\frac{O}{O} \\), an expression from which nothing can be concluded. We have an example of this in the fraction \\( \\frac{x-a}{x^2-a^2} \\), which, by supposing \\( x = a \\) becomes \\( \\frac{a-a}{a^2-a^2} = \\frac{0}{0} \\); we must not however conclude that the fraction has no determinate value in this particular case, for if we consider that its numerator and denominator have a common divisor, viz. \\( x-a \\), it is evident that by taking this divisor out of both, the fraction \\( \\frac{x-a}{x^2-a^2} = \\frac{x-a}{(x-a)(x+a)} \\)\n\nbecomes \\( \\frac{1}{x+a} \\), an expression, which in the case of \\( x = a \\) is equal to \\( \\frac{1}{2a} \\).\n\n87. In general, if we make \\( x = a \\) in an expression of this form \\( \\frac{P(x-a)^m}{Q(x-a)^n} \\), it becomes \\( \\frac{0}{0} \\); however its true value is either nothing, or finite, or infinite, according as \\( m > n \\), or \\( m = n \\), or \\( m < n \\); for by taking out the factors common to the numerator and denominator, the fraction becomes \\( \\frac{P(x-a)^{m-n}}{Q} \\) in the first case, \\( \\frac{P}{Q} \\) in the second, and \\( \\frac{P}{Q(x-a)^{n-m}} \\) in the third; here we suppose that \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are such functions as neither become nothing, nor infinite, by the supposition of \\( x = a \\).\n\n88. Therefore, when by giving a particular value to \\( x \\) a function of that quantity assumes the form \\( \\frac{0}{0} \\), to discover the true value of the function in this particular case, we must disengage the factors which are common to the numerator and denominator. This may be done in most cases by finding their common measure (Algebra, \u00a7 49.) but the direct method of fluxions furnishes us with another method.\n\nIn the expression \\( P(x-a) \\), where \\( P \\) denotes any function of \\( x \\) that is independent of \\( x-a \\), if we suppose \\( x = a \\), then the expression vanishes; the fluxion however of the expression, viz. \\( (x-a)P + Px \\), is a quantity which does not vanish when \\( x = a \\), but is then reduced to its last term, that is to \\( Px \\).\nDirect Method.\n\nAgain, the function \\( P(x-a)^n \\) vanishes by supposing \\( x = a \\), but if we take its fluxion, viz. \\((x-a)^n \\dot{P} + 2(x-a) \\dot{P} x + 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot P \\ddot{x}^2 \\), an expression which does not vanish upon the hypothesis of \\( x = a \\), but is reduced to its last term, viz. \\( 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot P \\ddot{x}^2 \\). By proceeding in this manner, it is easy to see that by taking the fluxion of a function of the form \\( P(x-a)^m \\) \\( m \\) times successively (\\( m \\) being a whole number) we shall finally obtain an expression, all the terms of which, except the last, vanish by supposing that \\( x = a \\); and that the last term will be \\( 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots m \\cdot P \\ddot{x}^m \\), an expression free from the factor \\((x-a)^m \\), and involving only the function \\( P \\).\n\n89. It is not necessary that we should know the number \\( n \\), nor that we should exhibit the factor \\((x-a)^n \\), in order to determine when the expression \\( P(x-a)^n \\) is freed from that factor. We have only to ascertain after each operation of taking the fluxion, whether the result vanishes or not, when we substitute \\( a \\) instead of \\( x \\); for in the last case the operation is finished, and the result is the quantity \\( 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots P \\ddot{x}^m \\). Suppose for example the function to be \\( x^3 - ax^2 - a^2x + a^3 \\), which vanishes when \\( x = a \\); its first fluxion also vanishes when \\( x = a \\), but not its second fluxion, which is \\((6x-2a)x^2 \\), hence we may conclude that the function has the form \\( P(x-a)^2 \\), which is besides obvious, because\n\n\\[ x^3 - ax^2 - a^2x + a^3 = (x+a)(x-a)^2. \\]\n\n90. In applying these observations to the fraction \\( \\frac{P(x-a)^m}{Q(x-a)^n} \\), it appears, that by repeating the operation of taking the fluxions of its numerator and denominator, they will be freed at once from the factor \\( x-a \\), if \\( m=n \\). If a result, which does not vanish, be obtained first from the numerator, then we may be assured, that the factor \\((x-a)\\) is found in the numerator raised to a less power than in the denominator, and in this case the fraction is infinite when \\( x=a \\). If on the contrary the first result that does not vanish is found from the denominator, then the numerator contains a higher power of \\((x-a)\\) than the denominator, and in this case, when \\( x=a \\), the fraction vanishes.\n\nThe rule for finding the value of a function which becomes \\( \\frac{0}{0} \\) by giving a particular value to \\( x \\) may therefore be expressed thus. Take the successive fluxions of both the numerator and denominator until a result which does not vanish be obtained from either the one or the other, or from both at the same time; in the first case the function is infinite, in the second it is equal to 0, and in the last case its value is finite.\n\n91. We proceed to illustrate this rule by a few examples.\n\nEx. 1. The value of the function \\( \\frac{x^3-1}{x^2-1} \\) is required when \\( x=1 \\).\n\nThe fluxion of the numerator is \\( 3x^2 \\), and that of the denominator is \\( 2x \\), neither of which quantities vanish when \\( x=1 \\), therefore in this particular case, the value of the fraction is \\( \\frac{3x^2}{2x} = \\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\nEx. 2. Suppose the fraction to be \\( \\frac{ax^2-2acx+ac^2}{bx^2-2bcx+bc^2} \\), which vanishes when \\( x=c \\).\n\nBy taking the fluxions of the numerator and denominator we obtain \\( \\frac{2ax-2ac}{2bx-2bc} = \\frac{a-x-ac}{b-x-bc} \\), a fraction, the numerator and denominator of which still vanish upon the hypothesis of \\( x=c \\), we therefore take the fluxions a second time, and get \\( \\frac{2ax^2}{2bx^2} = \\frac{a}{b} \\) for the value of the proposed fraction in the particular case of \\( x=c \\).\n\nEx. 3. Suppose the fraction to be \\( \\frac{x^3-ax^2+a^2x-a^3}{x^2-a^2} \\), which vanishes when \\( x=a \\). In this example, by taking the fluxions of the numerator and denominator once, we get\n\n\\[ \\frac{3x^2-2ax+a^2}{2x} = \\frac{3x^2-2ax+a^2}{2x}, \\]\n\nan expression, of which only the numerator vanishes upon the supposition of \\( x=a \\), hence we may conclude the true value of the fraction in this case to be 0.\n\nThe contrary happens in the fraction\n\n\\[ \\frac{ax-n^2}{a^2-2an+2an^2-n^4}; \\]\n\nwe may therefore conclude that when \\( x=a \\) this last fraction becomes infinite.\n\n92. The rule of \u00a7 90 can only be applied when the factors common to the numerator and denominator are integer powers of \\( x-a \\), or as by taking the fluxions, the index of \\((x-a)^m\\) is diminished by an unit at each operation; when \\( m \\) is a fraction we shall at last arrive at a result containing negative powers of \\( x-a \\), which therefore, when \\( x=a \\), will become infinite. The following mode of proceeding will however apply to all cases whatever.\n\nLet \\( X \\) be a fraction of which the numerator and denominator both vanish when \\( x=a \\); by substituting in it \\( a+h \\) instead of \\( x \\), the functions \\( X \\) and \\( X' \\) may be expanded into a series of this form,\n\n\\[ A h^\\alpha + B h^\\beta + \\&c., \\quad A' h'^\\alpha + B' h'^\\beta + \\&c. \\]\n\nwhich are ascending, that is, having the exponents of the powers positive and increasing; because the series must become 0, upon the hypothesis that \\( h=0 \\). We have therefore\n\n\\[ \\frac{A h^\\alpha + B h^\\beta + \\&c.}{A' h'^\\alpha + B' h'^\\beta + \\&c.} \\]\n\ninstead of the proposed fraction.\nNow if \\(a = a'\\), by dividing the numerator and denominator of this expression by the factor \\(h\\), which is common to all the terms of each, it becomes\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A + B h^2 - a'}{A' + B h^3 - a'} + \\text{&c.}\n\\]\n\na quantity which, by supposing \\(h = 0\\), is reduced to \\(\\frac{0}{A'}\\), that is to 0. If again \\(a = a'\\), the expression for the fraction, after dividing the numerator and denominator by \\(h\\), is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A + B h^2 - a'}{A' + B h^3 - a'} + \\text{&c.}\n\\]\n\nwhich, by supposing \\(h\\) to be \\(= 0\\), becomes simply \\(\\frac{A}{A'}\\), a finite quantity. If, however, \\(a < a'\\), then the expression for the fraction is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A + B h^2 - a'}{A h^2 - a'} + \\text{&c.}\n\\]\n\nwhich, when \\(h = 0\\), becomes \\(\\frac{A}{0}\\), an expression which may be considered as infinite. Thus it appears that in each case the true value of the fraction depends only on \\(A\\) and \\(A'\\), the first terms of the series.\n\nThe following rule is applicable to every function that can appear under the indeterminate form \\(\\frac{0}{0}\\).\n\nFind the first term of each of the ascending series which express the developments of the numerator and denominator when \\(a + h\\) is substituted in them instead of \\(x\\). Reduce the new function formed of these first terms to its most simple form, and make \\(h = 0\\); the results shall be the different values of the proposed function when \\(x\\) is made equal to \\(a\\).\n\nExample. Suppose the function to be\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{x} - \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{(x-a)}}{\\sqrt{(x^2-a^2)}},\n\\]\n\nwhich, when \\(x = a\\), becomes \\(\\frac{0}{0}\\). By substituting \\(a + h\\) instead of \\(x\\), and developing the results into series, the numerator becomes \\(h^2 + \\frac{h}{2\\sqrt{a}} + \\text{&c.}\\) and the denominator \\(\\sqrt{2a} h^2 + \\frac{h}{2\\sqrt{2a}} + \\text{&c.}\\). Taking now the first term of each series, we have \\(\\frac{h^2}{2\\sqrt{2a}} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2a}}\\), an expression in which \\(h\\) is not found; therefore the value of the function is \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2a}}\\), when \\(x = a\\).\n\nOf the Radii of Curvature.\n\n93. Let HC'CF represent a material curve, or mould. Let a thread be fastened to it at H, and made to pass along the curve, so as to coincide with it in its whole extent from H to F. Let the thread be now unlooped or evolved from the curve, then its extremity F will describe another curve line FAPP'. The curve HCF is called the Evolute of the curve FAP; and the curve FAP is called the Involute of the curve HCF.\n\n94. From this mode of conceiving the curve to be generated, we may draw the following conclusions.\n\n1st. Suppose PC to be a portion of the thread detached from the evolute, then PC will be a tangent to the evolute at C.\n\n2dly. The line PC will be perpendicular to a tangent to the curve FAP at the point P, or will be a normal to the curve at that point. For the point P may be considered as describing at the same time an element of the curve FAP, and an element of a circle \\(qPq'\\) whose momentary centre is C, and which has PC for its radius.\n\n3dly. That part of the curve between F and P, which is described with radii all of which are shorter than CP is more incurvated than a circle described on P as a centre, with a radius equal to CP. And in like manner PP', the part of the curve on the other side of P, which is described with radii greater than PC, is less incurvated than that circle.\n\n4thly. The circle \\(qPq'\\) has the same curvature as the curve APP' itself has at P; hence it is called an Equicurve circle, and its radius PC is called the Radius of Curvature at the point C.\n\n95. We are now to investigate how the radius of curvature at any point in FAP any proposed curve may be found.\n\nLet AB and BP be the co-ordinates at P any point in the curve, and PC its radius of curvature; and let PC meet AB in E. Put the abscissa \\(AB = x\\), the ordinate \\(BP = y\\), the arch \\(AP = z\\), the angle AEP (that is, the arch which measures that angle, radius being unity) \\(= v\\), the radius of curvature \\(PC = r\\). Take P' another point in the curve, and let \\(P'C'\\) be the radius of curvature at that point. Let \\(P'C'\\) meet \\(AB\\) in \\(E'\\), and PC in D, and on D as a centre, with a radius \\(= r\\), describe an arch of a circle, meeting the radii PC, \\(P'C'\\) in m and n. Then the arch \\(PP'\\) will be the increment of \\(z\\); and since the angle \\(PDP'\\) is the difference of the angles \\(PEA, P'E'A\\), the arch \\(m n\\) will be the corresponding increment of \\(v\\).\n\nSuppose now the point \\(P'\\) to approach continually to \\(P\\), then the points \\(C'\\) and \\(D\\) will approach to \\(C\\), and the ratio of the arch \\(PP'\\), the increment of \\(z\\), to the arch \\(m n\\) the increment of \\(v\\), will approach to the ratio of CP to \\(C m\\), that is to the ratio of \\(r\\) to 1; therefore the ratio of \\(r\\) to 1 is the limit of the ratio of \\(PP'\\) to \\(mn\\), or \\(r = \\lim_{PP' \\to mn} \\frac{PP'}{mn}\\), and passing to the ratio of the fluxions, \\(r = \\lim_{PP' \\to mn} \\frac{PP'}{mn}\\), thus we have obtained a formula expressing the radius of curvature, by means of the fluxion of the arch of the curve, and the fluxion of the angle which a normal to the curve makes with the line of the abscissas. We proceed to deduce from this formula other\nother expressions which may involve the fluxions of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) only.\n\n96. Because PE is a normal to the curve at E, the tangent of the angle PEA or \\( v \\) is equal to \\( \\frac{x}{y} \\) (\\$75.), put \\( \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\dot{y}} = i \\), then because tan. \\( v = t \\), we have by taking the fluxions (\\$60.), \\( \\dot{v} \\) fec. \\( ^2 \\) \\( v = i \\), but fec. \\( ^2 \\) \\( v = -\\frac{1}{t} \\tan. \\( ^2 \\) \\( v \\) \\( = 1 + \\frac{\\dot{x}^2}{\\dot{y}^2} = \\frac{x^2 + y^2}{y^2} \\) (\\$63.), therefore \\( \\frac{\\dot{v}}{\\dot{y}^2} = i \\)\n\nand \\( \\dot{v} = \\frac{\\dot{y}^2}{x^2} \\).\n\nSubstituting now this value of \\( \\dot{v} \\) in the formula \\( r = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\dot{v}} \\)\n\nit becomes \\( r = \\frac{\\dot{x}^3}{\\dot{y}^3} \\).\n\nIf we now recollect that \\( t = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\dot{y}} \\), and that \\( \\dot{x}^2 = \\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 \\), it will appear that this other expression which we have found for \\( r \\) involves in effect the fluxions of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) only.\n\n97. In computing the values of \\( t = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\dot{y}} \\), and \\( \\frac{\\dot{x}^3}{\\dot{y}^3} \\) we may consider any two of the three quantities \\( x, y, z \\), as a function of the remaining quantity; and upon that hypothesis compute their fluxions.\n\nThus if we suppose that \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) are functions of \\( x \\), then, as in taking the fluxions of \\( y, t, \\) and \\( z \\), we must consider \\( x \\) as a given or constant quantity, from the equation \\( t = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\dot{y}} \\) we have \\( i = -\\frac{\\dot{x}^2}{\\dot{y}^2} \\) (\\$39.), and substituting this value of \\( i \\) in \\( \\frac{\\dot{x}^3}{\\dot{y}^3} \\), the value last found for \\( r \\), it becomes\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{\\dot{x}^3}{\\dot{y}^3} = \\frac{(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{\\dot{x}^2} \\]\n\nIf again, instead of considering \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) as functions of \\( x \\), we consider \\( x \\) and \\( z \\) as functions of \\( y \\), then from the equation \\( t = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\dot{y}} \\) (as \\( \\dot{y} \\) must now be reckoned constant),\n\nwe get \\( i = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\dot{y}} \\), thus the formula \\( r = \\frac{\\dot{x}^3}{\\dot{y}^3} \\) becomes\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{\\dot{x}^3}{\\dot{y}^3} = \\frac{(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{\\dot{x}^2} \\]\n\nWe shall now apply these formulae to some examples.\n\n98. Example 1.\u2014It is required to find the general expression for the radius of curvature of a parabola.\n\nThe equation of the parabola is \\( y = a^{\\frac{1}{2}} x^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\), there-\n\nfore, \\( \\dot{y} = \\frac{a^{\\frac{1}{2}} x^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{2 x^{\\frac{1}{2}}} \\), and, making \\( \\dot{x} \\) constant,\n\n\\[ \\dot{y} = \\frac{-a^{\\frac{1}{2}} x^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{4 x^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\]\n\ntherefore, \\( \\dot{x} = \\sqrt{(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2)} \\)\n\n\\[ \\dot{x} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{4a^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x} \\right) \\]\n\nand, putting \\( r \\) for the radius of curvature,\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{\\dot{x}^3}{\\dot{y}^3} = \\frac{(a + 4x)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{2 \\sqrt{a}} \\]\n\nIf in this general expression, we put \\( x = 0 \\), we find \\( \\frac{a^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{2 \\sqrt{a}} = \\frac{1}{2} a \\) for the radius of curvature at the vertex of the curve.\n\nEx. 2. Suppose the curve to be an ellipse, required as in the last example.\n\nPutting \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) to denote the two axes, the equation of the ellipse is \\( a^2 y^2 = c^2 (a x - x^2) \\). Therefore taking the first and second fluxions, we have \\( 2 a^2 y \\dot{y} = c^2 \\dot{x} (a - 2x) \\),\n\nand \\( 2 a^2 \\dot{y}^2 + 2 a^2 y \\ddot{y} = -2 c^2 x \\dot{x} \\); whence \\( \\dot{y} = \\frac{c^2 \\dot{x} (a - 2x)}{2 a^2 y} \\), and \\( \\dot{y} = \\frac{a^2 \\dot{y}^2 + c^2 \\dot{x}^2}{a^2 y} \\), which expressions, by substituting the values of \\( y \\) and \\( \\dot{y} \\) become\n\n\\[ \\dot{y} = \\frac{c \\dot{x} (a - 2x)}{2a \\sqrt{(ax - x^2)}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\dot{y} = \\frac{a^2 c^2 \\dot{x} (a - 2x)^2}{4 a^3 c (a x - x^2) \\sqrt{(a x - x^2)}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\dot{y} = \\frac{c \\dot{x} (a - 2x)^2}{4 (a x - x^2) \\sqrt{(a x - x^2)}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\dot{y} = \\frac{c \\dot{x}^3}{4 (a x - x^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\]\n\ntherefore,\n\n\\[ \\dot{x} = \\sqrt{(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2)} \\]\n\n\\[ \\dot{x} = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{c^2 \\dot{x}^2 (a - 2x)^2}{4 a^2 (a x - x^2)} + \\dot{x}^2 \\right)} \\]\n\n\\[ \\dot{x} = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{2a} \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{c^2 \\dot{x}^2 + (a^2 - c^2) (a x - x^2)^2}{a x - x^2} \\right)} \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{\\dot{x}^3}{\\dot{y}^3} = \\frac{(a^2 c^2 + 4 (a^2 - c^2) (a x - x^2)^2)}{2 a^4 c} \\]\n\nwhich expression, when \\( x = 0 \\), becomes simply \\( \\frac{c^2}{2a} \\), the radius of curvature at the vertices of the transverse axis; but when \\( x = \\frac{a}{2} \\), it becomes \\( \\frac{a^2}{2c} \\), the radius of curvature at the vertices of the conjugate axis.\nPART II. THE INVERSE METHOD OF FLUXIONS.\n\n99. AS the Direct Method of fluxions treats of finding the relation between the fluxions of variable quantities, having given the relation subsisting between the quantities themselves; so the Inverse Method treats of finding the relation subsisting between the variable quantities, having given the relation of their fluxions.\n\nWhatever be the relation between variable quantities, we can in every case assign the relation of their fluxions; therefore the direct method of fluxions may in this respect be considered as perfect. But it is not the same with the inverse method, for there are no direct and general rules, by which we can in every case determine from the relation of the fluxions, that of their flowing quantities or fluents. All we can do is to compare any proposed fluxion with such fluxions as are derived from known fluents by the rules of the direct method, and if we find it to have the same form as one of these, we may conclude that the fluents of both, or at least the variable parts of these fluents, are identical.\n\n100. In the direct method we have shewn, that by proper transformations, the finding of the fluxion of any proposed function is reducible to the finding of the fluxions of a few simple functions, and of the sums, or products, or quotients of such functions. In like manner, in the inverse method we must endeavour to transform complex fluxionary expressions into others more simple, so as to reduce them, if possible, to some fluxion, the fluent of which we already know.\n\nSect. I. Of the Fluents of Fluxions involving one variable quantity.\n\n101. As when $y$ is such a function of a variable quantity $x$, that $y = A x^m + C$, where $A$, $m$ and $C$ denote constant quantities, we find by the direct method (\u00a7 36. and \u00a7 26.) that $\\dot{y} = m A x^{m-1} \\dot{x}$, or (putting $a$ instead of $m A$, and $n$ instead of $m-1$), $\\dot{y} = a x^n \\dot{x}$; so on the contrary, as often as we have the fluxional equation\n\n$$\\dot{y} = a x^n \\dot{x},$$\n\nwe may conclude that the relation of the fluents is expressed by the equation\n\n$$y = \\frac{a x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C,$$\n\nfor by substituting $m A$ instead of $a$, and $m-1$ instead of $n$ in this equation, it becomes $y = A x^m + C$, the same equation as that from which the fluxional equation was derived.\n\n102. The value of the constant quantity $C$, which is generally called by writers on fluxions, the correction of the fluent, is to be determined from the particular inquiry in which the fluxional equation $\\dot{y} = a x^n \\dot{x}$ occurs. If it be known that $y = 0$, when $x$ acquires some known magnitude, which may be denoted by $b$, then the general equation $y = \\frac{a x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$, becomes in that particular case\n\n$$0 = \\frac{a b^{n+1}}{n+1} + C;$$\n\nHence, by subtracting each side of this last equation from the corresponding side of the former, we get\n\n$$y = \\frac{a (x^{n+1} - b^{n+1})}{n+1}$$\n\nan equation that is independent of the constant and arbitrary quantity $C$.\n\n103. By giving particular values to $n$ in the fluxional equation $\\dot{y} = a x^n \\dot{x}$, and in that of the fluents $y = \\frac{a (x^{n+1} - b^{n+1})}{n+1}$, we may obtain particular fluxional equations, and corresponding equations of the fluents. There is, however, one case which requires to be noticed; it is when $n = -1$; then the equation of the fluxions is $\\dot{y} = a x^{-1} \\dot{x} = \\frac{a \\dot{x}}{x}$, and that of the fluents, according to the general formula $y = \\frac{a (x^{n+1} - b^{n+1})}{n+1}$\n\n$$= \\frac{a (x^0 - b^0)}{0} = \\frac{a (1 - 1)}{0} = 0,$$\n\nbut from this expression it is manifest, that nothing can be concluded. The value of the function $\\frac{a (x^{n+1} - b^{n+1})}{n+1}$, in the particular case of $n+1 = 0$, may be found by the rule given in \u00a7 90 for determining the value of a function when it assumes the form $\\frac{0}{0}$; but it may be otherwise found by proceeding thus. Put $n+1 = m$, and let $p = \\log_e x$, and $q = \\log_e b$; then, by the formula of \u00a7 54,\n\n$$x^m = 1 + p m + \\frac{p^2 m^2}{2} + &c.,$$\n\n$$b^m = 1 + q m + \\frac{q^2 m^2}{2} + &c.,$$\n\nand therefore\n\n$$x^m - b^m = (p-q) m + \\left(\\frac{(p-q)^2}{2}\\right) m^2 + &c.,$$\n\nand $$\\frac{x^m - b^m}{m} = (p-q) + \\left(\\frac{(p-q)^2}{2}\\right) m + &c.$$\nThus we have $\\frac{a^m - b^m}{m}$ or $\\frac{a^{n+1} - b^{n+1}}{n+1}$ expressed generally by a series, all the terms of which, except the first, being multiplied by $m$ or $n+1$, will vanish when $n+1=0$, or when $n=-1$, hence it appears, that the general equation $y = \\frac{a(x^n + bx^{n+1})}{n+1}$ becomes in the particular case of $n=-1$, $y = a(p-q)$, which, substituting for $p$ and $q$ their values, and observing that\n\n$$\\log_e x \\log_e b = \\frac{1}{\\log_e e} \\times \\log_e \\frac{x}{b},$$\n\nbecomes\n\n$$y = \\frac{a}{\\log_e e} \\times \\log_e \\frac{x}{b},$$\n\nwhere $\\log_e e$, and $\\log_e \\frac{x}{b}$ are to be taken according to the same system, which may be any system of logarithms whatever. So that if we take the Napierian system, in which $\\log_e e = 1$, then\n\n$$y = a \\cdot \\frac{x}{b} = a \\cdot x - a \\cdot b = a \\cdot x + C,$$\n\nwhere $C$ denotes a constant quantity, and where the letter $l$, in this formula, and in others in which it may occur, is put as an abbreviation of the words Napierian logarithm, so that by $a \\cdot l \\cdot x$ is meant $a$ multiplied by the Napierian logarithm of $x$, &c.\n\nThis expression which we have found for the value of $y$ in the particular case of $y = ax^{-1}x$, or $\\frac{ax}{x}$, coincides with what we might have found by considering that when $y = 1 \\cdot x$, it has been shewn ($\u00a7 57$) that $y = \\frac{x}{x}$; so that conversely, when $y = \\frac{ax}{x}$, we may conclude that $y = a \\cdot x + C$ where $C$ denotes a constant quantity, to be determined from the particular question in which the fluxional equation may occur.\n\n104. It must now be evident that if\n\n$$y = ax^m + bx^n + cx^p + \\ldots + C,$$\n\nwhere $m$, $n$, $p$, &c. are constant numbers, then\n\n$$y = \\frac{ax^{m+1}}{m+1} + \\frac{bx^{n+1}}{n+1} + \\frac{cx^{p+1}}{p+1} + \\ldots + C;$$\n\nhere $C$ denotes a constant arbitrary quantity that may be considered as the sum of the constant quantities which ought to be added to the terms $\\frac{ax^{m+1}}{m+1}$, $\\frac{bx^{n+1}}{n+1}$, &c., each being regarded as a distinct fluent.\n\n105. In general, since that when\n\n$$y = at + bv + cu + \\ldots + C,$$\n\nwhere $t$, $v$, $u$, &c. denote any functions of a variable quantity, and $C$ a constant quantity, we have ($\u00a7 35$, and \u00a7 36.)\n\n$$y = at + bv + cu + \\ldots + C.$$\n\nSo on the contrary, if we have any fluxional equation of this last form, we may conclude that\n\n$$y = at + bv + cu + \\ldots + C.$$\n\nAnd since that when $u = v + C$, where $u$, $v$ and $t$ denote any function of a variable quantity, and $C$ a constant quantity, we have ($\u00a7 37$), $u = v + tv$, so on the contrary, if\n\n$$u = v + tv,$$\n\nwe may conclude that\n\n$$u = v + C,$$\n\nand in like manner if we have,\n\n$$\\frac{tv}{t} = \\frac{v}{t},$$\n\nwe may infer from ($\u00a7 39$) that\n\n$$u = \\frac{v}{t} + C.$$\n\n106. It is often convenient to denote the fluent of a fluxional expression without actually exhibiting that fluent. For this purpose we shall employ the sign $\\int$, putting it before the fluxion whose fluent we mean to denote. Thus, by the expression $\\int ax^n x$, is to be understood the fluent of $ax^n x$; and as this fluent has been found to be $\\frac{ax^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$, we may express this conclusion in symbols shortly thus,\n\n$$\\int ax^n x = \\frac{ax^{n+1}}{n+1} + C.$$\n\n107. Suppose we have $y = (ax + b)^m x$, we may expand $(ax + b)^m$ into a series, and multiply the series by $x$, and find the fluent of each term of the result. But we may also find the fluent of this expression without employing the development of $(ax + b)^m$, by proceeding thus. Put $ax + b = z$, then $x = \\frac{z-b}{a}$, and $x = \\frac{z}{a}$.\n\nSubstitute now these values of $ax + b$, and $x$, in the expression for $y$, and it becomes $y = \\frac{z^{m+1}}{a}$; hence we have ($\u00a7 101$) $y = \\frac{z^{m+1}}{a(m+1)} + C$, and consequently, by substituting $(ax + b)$ for $z$,\n\n$$y = \\frac{(ax + b)^{m+1}}{a(m+1)} + C.$$\n\n108. Suppose that $y = (ax^n + b)^m x^n - 1$. By putting as before $ax^n + b = z$, we have $nax^n - 1x^n = z$, and $x^n = \\frac{z}{na}$; hence $y = \\frac{z^{m+1}}{na} + C$, and, substituting for $z$ its value $ax^n + b$,\nLet us now consider fractional functions, and to begin with a simple case, let us suppose that \\( y = \\frac{Ax^n}{(ax+b)^n} \\). Put \\( ax + b = z \\), then \\( x = \\frac{z - b}{a} \\), and consequently,\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{A(z-b)^n}{a^n + z^n};\n\\]\n\nWe have now only to find the development of \\((z-b)^n\\), to multiply each of its terms by \\( z \\) and divide it by \\( z^n \\), and take the fluent of the result.\n\nLet us take for example the case of \\( m = 3 \\), and \\( n = 2 \\), then\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{A(z-b)^3}{a^4 z^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{A}{a^4} \\left\\{ z^3 - 3b^2z + 3b^3z^{-1} - b^4z^{-2} \\right\\}\n\\]\n\nHence, taking the fluents of the several terms, as in \u00a7 105, we have\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{A}{a^4} \\left\\{ \\frac{z^3}{2} - 3b^2z + 3b^3z^{-1} + b^4z^{-2} \\right\\} + C.\n\\]\n\nLet us now restore the value of \\( z \\), and then it appears, that when\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{Ax^n}{(ax+b)^m},\n\\]\n\nthen, we may write the equation thus,\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{Ax^n}{(ax+b)^m} + \\frac{Bx^n}{(ax+b)^m} + \\frac{Cx^n}{(ax+b)^m} + \\ldots + C,\n\\]\n\nand take the fluent of each term, in the same manner as we have found the fluent of \\( \\frac{Ax^n}{(ax+b)^m} \\).\n\nOf the Fluents of rational Fractions.\n\nEvery fluxion that is a rational fraction is comprehended under this general formula,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(Ax^n + Bx^n + Cx^n + \\ldots + C)}{Ax^n + Bx^n + Cx^n + \\ldots + C},\n\\]\n\nwhich, by putting \\( U \\) to denote the expression between the parentheses in the numerator, and \\( V \\) the denominator, may be represented by \\( \\frac{Ux}{V} \\). Now in the first place, we remark that the greatest exponent of the powers of \\( x \\) in the numerator may be supposed to be less than that of its powers in the denominator. For if it were not so, by dividing \\( U \\) by \\( V \\), and calling \\( Q \\) the quotient, and \\( R \\) the remainder, we should have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Ux}{V} = Qx + \\frac{R}{V},\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{Ux}{V} = \\int Qx + \\int \\frac{R}{V}.\n\\]\n\nNow, \\( Q \\) being a rational and integer function, \\( \\int Qx \\) may be found, as in \u00a7 101, and it only remains to find \\( \\int \\frac{R}{V} \\), an expression in which the highest exponent of the powers of \\( x \\) in \\( R \\) is less by unity than in \\( V \\); so that the fraction \\( \\frac{R}{V} \\) may be generally expressed thus,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(Ax^n + Bx^n + Cx^n + \\ldots + T)x}{x^n + A'x^{n-1} + B'x^{n-2} + C'x^{n-3} \\ldots + T'}.\n\\]\n\nThe general method of finding the fluent of a fractional expression of this form consists in decomposing it into a series of other fractions, the denominators of which are more simple. These fractions may be found by proceeding as follows: By putting the denominator of the proposed fraction equal to 0, we get this equation,\n\n\\[\nx^n + A'x^{n-1} + B'x^{n-2} \\ldots + T' = 0.\n\\]\n\nSuppose now that the roots of this equation are found, and that they are denoted by\n\n\\[\n-a, -a', -a'', -a''', \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhich quantities we shall suppose in the first place, are all unequal. Then the expression which has been assumed as equal to 0, may (ALGEBRA, Sect. X.) be considered as the product of \\( n \\) factors\n\n\\[\nx + a, x + a', x + a'', x + a''',\n\\]\n\nLet the proposed fraction \\( \\frac{R}{V} \\) be now assumed as equal to the sum of the simple fractions\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N}{x+a}, \\frac{N'}{x+a'}, \\frac{N''}{x+a''}, \\ldots\n\\]\n\nhaving for their denominators the simple factors of the denominator of the proposed fraction, and for their numerators quantities which are constant, but as yet are indetermined.\n\nThat we may avoid complicated calculations, and present a determinate object to the mind, let us suppose that the fluxion of which we are to find the fluent is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(Ax^2 + Bx + C)x}{x^3 + A'x^2 + B'x + C'},\n\\]\n\nand that we have by the resolution of the cubic equation \\( x^3 + A'x^2 + B'x + C' = 0 \\) found\n\n\\[\nx^3 + A'x^2 + B'x + C' = (x+a)(x+a')(x+a'').\n\\]\nThe fractions\n\n\\[ \\frac{N}{x+a}, \\frac{N'}{x+a'}, \\frac{N''}{x+a''} \\]\n\nwhen reduced to a common denominator are\n\n\\[ \\frac{N(x+a')(x+a'')}{(x+a)(x+a')(x+a'')}, \\frac{N'(x+a)(x+a'')}{(x+a)(x+a')(x+a'')} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{N''(x+a)(x+a')}{(x+a)(x+a')(x+a'')} \\]\n\nThe common denominator of these fractions is the same as that of the proposed fraction, and each of the numerators, as well as their sum, is a function of \\( x \\) of a degree lower than the denominator, that is, in the present case, it is a function of the second degree. By taking the actual products of the factors in the numerators, and adding the results, we find the sum of the fractions equal to\n\n\\[ V = \\left\\{ \\frac{(N+N'+N'')x^3}{x+a} + \\left\\{ N(a+a') + N'(a+a') + N''(a+a') \\right\\} x \\right\\} \\]\n\nwhere \\( V \\) denotes the common denominator \\((x+a)(x+a')(x+a'')=x^3+A'x^2+B'x+C'\\). Setting aside the factor \\( \\frac{x}{V} \\) of the above expression, we are now to compare that part of it which involves the three indeterminate quantities \\( N, N', N'' \\), with \\( A'x^2+B'x+C' \\), the numerator of the proposed fraction, thus we obtain these three equations\n\n\\[ N+N'+N''=A, \\]\n\\[ N(a+a') + N'(a+a') + N''(a+a')=B, \\]\n\\[ Na'a''+N'a'a''+N''a'=C. \\]\n\nBy these equations, which are all of the first degree, we may determine the values of \\( N, N', N'' \\), and thus we have the proposed fraction\n\n\\[ \\frac{(Ax^2+Bx+C)x}{x^3+A'x^2+B'x+C'} \\]\n\nequal to\n\n\\[ \\frac{Nx}{x+a} + \\frac{N'x}{x+a'} + \\frac{N''x}{x+a''} \\]\n\nwhere \\( N, N', N'' \\), and \\( a, a', a'' \\), are constant and known quantities.\n\nPut \\( x+a=z \\), then \\( x=z-a \\), and the fraction \\( \\frac{Nx}{x+a} \\) is transformed to \\( \\frac{Nz}{z} \\), of which the fluent is \\( N1.z=N1. \\)\n\n\\[ (x+a) (\\S 103). \\] In like manner we find \\( \\int \\frac{N'x}{x+a'} = N'1.(x+a') \\), and \\( \\int \\frac{N''x}{x+a''} = N''1.(x+a'') \\), and consequently\n\n\\[ \\int \\frac{(Ax^2+Bx+C)x}{x^3+A'x^2+B'x+C'} = N1.(x+a)+N'1.(x+a') + N''1.(x+a'') + \\text{const}. \\]\n\n\\[ = 1. \\left\\{ (x+a)^N(x+a')^{N'}(x+a'')^{N''} \\right\\} + \\text{const}. \\]\n\nwhere by const. is meant a constant quantity.\n\nIt is easy to extend this mode of proceeding to the general formula given at the beginning of this \u00a7; and it is obvious, that as often as the denominator of a rational fraction can be decomposed into real and unequal factors, the determination of the fluent of that fraction is attended with no other difficulty than this decomposition, which requires the numerical resolution of equations.\n\n112. We have supposed that the factors of the denominator of the proposed fraction are unequal among themselves, and it is only when this is the case that the fraction can be decomposed into others, having all this form \\( \\frac{N}{x+a} \\). If we suppose that the denominator \\( x^n+A'x^{n-1}+B'x^{n-2}+\\ldots+T' \\) has a factor of the form \\((x+a)^p\\), then the proposed fraction\n\n\\[ \\frac{(Ax^{n-1}+Bx^{n-2}+Cx^{n-3}+\\ldots+T)x}{x^n+A'x^{n-1}+B'x^{n-2}+C'x^{n-3}+\\ldots+T} \\]\n\nmust be assumed equal to\n\n\\[ \\frac{(P_{x^{p-1}}+Q_{x^{p-2}}+R_{x^{p-3}}+\\ldots+Y)x}{(x+a)^p} \\]\n\n\\[ + \\frac{N'x}{x+a'} + \\frac{N''x}{x+a''} \\ldots \\]\n\nwhere \\( P, Q, R, \\ldots, Y, N, N', \\ldots \\) denotes indeterminate but constant quantities, and \\( x+a, x+a', x+a'' \\), &c., are the remaining factors of the denominator of the proposed fraction. To determine the quantities \\( P, Q, R, \\ldots, Y, N, N', \\ldots \\) we must now proceed in all respects as in last \u00a7, that is, we must reduce the fractions involving these quantities to a common denominator, which will be the same as the denominator of the proposed fraction; then we must add the numerators, and put the coefficient of each power of \\( x \\) in the sum equal to the coefficient of the same power in the numerator of the proposed fraction. Thus we shall have as many equations as indeterminate quantities, and by resolving these equations, the values of these quantities will be found.\n\nHaving thus determined all the quantities \\( P, Q, R, \\ldots, Y \\), which enter into the fraction\n\n\\[ \\frac{(P_{x^{p-1}}+Q_{x^{p-2}}+\\ldots+Y)x}{(x+a)^p} \\]\n\nits fluent may be found as shown in \u00a7 109. But we may also assume it equal to\n\n\\[ \\frac{Mx}{(x+a)^p} + \\frac{M'x}{(x+a)^{p-1}} + \\frac{M''x}{(x+a)^{p-2}} \\ldots + \\frac{M''''x}{x+a} \\]\n\nand, it is easy to see, that by reducing these fractions to\na common denominator and adding them, the numerator of their sum will have the same form as that of the fraction whose fluent we are seeking; so that the values of the indeterminate quantities $M$, $M'$, &c. will be found by putting the coefficients of the same power of $x$ in both numerators equal to each other. To find the fluent of\n\n$$\\frac{M \\dot{x}}{(x+a)^p}$$\n\nwe may assume $x+a=z$, then $\\dot{x}=\\dot{z}$, and\n\n$$\\int \\frac{M \\dot{x}}{(x+a)^p} = \\int \\frac{M \\dot{z}}{z^p} = M \\frac{1}{1-p}.$$ \n\nIn like manner\n\n$$\\int \\frac{M' \\dot{x}}{(x+a)^{p-1}} = \\frac{M'}{(2-p)(x+a)^{p-2}}$$\n\nand so on, all the fluents being algebraic, except the last $\\int \\frac{M'' \\dot{x}}{x+a}$ which is $M''(x+a)$, a logarithmic function.\n\n113. In resolving the equation\n\n$$x^n + A'x^{n-1} + B'x^{n-2} + \\ldots + T = 0,$$\n\nit may happen that some of its roots $a, a', a''$, &c. are imaginary quantities, and then some of the simple factors $x+a, x+a', x+a''$, &c. will be imaginary. These factors always occur in pairs (ALGEBRA, \u00a7 179.) and have this form\n\n$$x+a+\\beta \\sqrt{-1}, \\quad x+a-\\beta \\sqrt{-1},$$\n\nso that their product\n\n$$x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2$$\n\nis a real factor of the second degree. As every corresponding pair of imaginary simple factors may be united in this manner into a real factor of the second degree, if these factors are all unequal, we may avoid introducing imaginary quantities into the fluent of the proposed fraction by proceeding thus. Let $x+a+\\beta \\sqrt{-1}$ and $x+a-\\beta \\sqrt{-1}$ denote two corresponding imaginary simple factors of the denominator. Instead of the two simple fractions\n\n$$\\frac{N \\dot{x}}{x+a+\\beta \\sqrt{-1}}, \\quad \\frac{N' \\dot{x}}{x+a-\\beta \\sqrt{-1}},$$\n\nwhich would have been assumed if the factors had been real, assume a single fraction\n\n$$\\frac{(Kx+L) \\dot{x}}{x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2}$$\n\nthe denominator of which is a real function of $x$ of the second degree, viz. that which is the product of the two imaginary factors. Here $K$ and $L$ denote two constant but indeterminate coefficients, the values of which, as\n\nVOL. VIII. Part II.\n\nalso those of the other indeterminate coefficients are to be found as before.\n\nIf the denominator of the proposed fraction have several equal factors of the second degree resulting from its imaginary simple factors, so that the product of those equal factors is\n\n$$(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2)^q;$$\n\nthen, corresponding to this product, we must, among the fractions having indeterminate coefficients, assume one of this form\n\n$$\\frac{(Q'x^{2q-1} + R'x^{2q-2} + \\ldots + Y') \\dot{x}}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2)^q},$$\n\nwhere $Q', R', \\ldots Y'$ denote constant and indeterminate coefficients, the values of which will be found in all respects as those of the others.\n\nWe are now to find the fluents of these two fluxional expressions, beginning with the first, viz.\n\n$$\\frac{(Kx+L) \\dot{x}}{x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{(Kx+L) \\dot{x}}{(x+a)^2 + \\beta^2}.$$\n\nPut $x+a=z$, then it becomes\n\n$$\\frac{(Kz+L-Ka) \\dot{z}}{z^2 + \\beta^2};$$\n\nand this again, by putting $L-Ka=M$, is resolved into these two fluions\n\n$$\\frac{Kz \\dot{z}}{z^2 + \\beta^2} + \\frac{M \\dot{z}}{z^2 + \\beta^2}.$$\n\nWe can immediately find the fluent of the first of these, by putting $z^2 + \\beta^2=v$, for then $z \\dot{z} = \\frac{\\dot{v}}{2}$, and\n\n$$\\int \\frac{Kz \\dot{z}}{z^2 + \\beta^2} = \\frac{K}{2} \\int \\frac{\\dot{v}}{v} = K \\ln v, (\\S 103.),$$\n\n$$= K \\ln (z^2 + \\beta^2).$$\n\nWith respect to the other fluxion, if we put $z=\\beta y$, we have\n\n$$\\frac{M \\dot{z}}{z^2 + \\beta^2} = \\frac{M \\dot{y}}{1+y^2},$$\n\nbut we have seen ($\\S 60.$) that $\\frac{\\dot{y}}{1+y^2}$ is the fluxion of an arch of which the tangent is $y$, therefore\n\n$$\\int \\frac{M \\dot{y}}{1+y^2} = \\frac{M}{\\beta} \\arctan \\left(\\frac{y}{\\beta}\\right) + \\text{const.}$$\n\nIt is proper to remark that if $\\frac{z}{\\beta}$ be the tangent of an arch, then the sine of that arch is $\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{(z^2 + \\beta^2)}}$, and its cosine is $\\frac{\\beta}{\\sqrt{(z^2 + \\beta^2)}}$, thus we may express the fluent under\nunder different forms, by introducing the fine or cofine of the arch instead of its tangent.\n\nIf instead of \\( x \\) we substitute in these two fluents \\( x + a \\), we find that the fluent of \\( \\frac{(Kx + L)x}{x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2} \\) is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L - Kx}{b} \\arctan \\left( \\tan \\frac{x}{b} \\right) + \\text{const}.\n\\]\n\n114. To find the fluent of the expression\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(Qx^{2q-1} + R'x^{2q-2} + \\cdots + Y')x}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2)^q},\n\\]\n\nwe first transform it to\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(Kx + L)x}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2)^q} + \\frac{(K'x + L')x}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2)^{q-1}} + \\cdots + \\frac{(K''x + L''x)}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2)^3},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( K, L, K', L' \\), &c. denote indeterminate but constant coefficients, which may be determined by reducing these fractions to a common denominator, and proceeding as in the two preceding \u00a7\u00a7. Then the whole difficulty is reduced to the finding of the fluxion of the expression\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(Kx + L)x}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2)^q} = \\frac{(Kx + L)x}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2)^q},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( q \\) denotes some integer number. To simplify this expression put \\( x + a = z \\), and \\( L - K = M \\), then it becomes \\( \\frac{(Kz + M)z}{(z^2 + b^2)^q} \\), which we shall now show may be reduced to \\( \\int \\frac{H'z}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-1}} \\). To effect this reduction we decompose its fluent into two parts\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{Kz}{(z^2 + b^2)^q} + \\int \\frac{Mz}{(z^2 + b^2)^q}.\n\\]\n\nThe fluent of the first part may be immediately found by putting \\( z^2 + b^2 = v \\); for then \\( z = \\frac{\\sqrt{v}}{2} \\) and\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{Kz}{(z^2 + b^2)^q} = \\int \\frac{Kv}{2v^q} = \\frac{K}{2(1-q)}.\n\\]\n\nLet us now suppose that the fluent of the second part \\( \\frac{Mz}{(z^2 + b^2)^q} \\) is equal to the sum of the algebraic function\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Gz}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-1}}, \\quad \\text{and another function, which is the fluent of } \\frac{H'z}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-1}}, \\text{ that is, let us assume}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{Mz}{(z^2 + b^2)^q} = \\frac{Gz}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-1}} + \\int \\frac{H'z}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-1}},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( G \\) and \\( H \\) are constant but indeterminate coefficients. To determine these let the fluxion of each side of this equation be taken (observing that the fluxion of a quantity having the sign \\( \\int \\) prefixed to it is the same quantity only without that sign); thus we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Mz}{(z^2 + b^2)^q} = \\frac{Gz}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-1}} - \\frac{2(q-1)Gz^2z}{(z^2 + b^2)^q} + \\frac{H'z}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-1}},\n\\]\n\nand from this equation, by rejecting what is common to each term, we find\n\n\\[\nM = G(z^2 + b^2) - 2(q-1)Gz^2 + H(z^2 + b^2),\n\\]\n\nand hence\n\n\\[\nM = Gz^2 + Hb^2 + (G - 2(q-1)G + H)z^2;\n\\]\n\nTherefore by comparing together like terms we find\n\n\\[\nM = Gz^2 + Hb^2, \\quad G - 2(q-1)G + H = 0;\n\\]\n\nand from these equations we get\n\n\\[\nG = \\frac{M}{(2q-2)b^2}, \\quad H = \\frac{(2q-3)M}{(2q-2)b^2}.\n\\]\n\nLet these values of \\( G \\) and \\( H \\) be now substituted in our assumed equation, and it becomes\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{Mz}{(z^2 + b^2)^q} = \\frac{M}{(2q-2)b^2} \\frac{z}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-1}} + \\frac{M(2q-3)}{(2q-2)b^2} \\int \\frac{z}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-1}}.\n\\]\n\nThus we have reduced the determination of the fluent of \\( \\frac{Mz}{(z^2 + b^2)^q} \\) to that of \\( \\frac{z}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-1}} \\), and by proceeding in the same manner with this last fluxion, its fluent may be made to depend on that of \\( \\frac{z}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-2}} \\); but this will be more readily effected by simply substituting \\( q-1 \\) instead of \\( q \\), and supposing \\( M = 1 \\) in the preceding equation.\n\nThus\nThus we shall obtain\n\n\\[ \\int \\frac{z}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-1}} = \\frac{1}{(2q-4)\\beta^3} \\left( \\frac{x}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-2}} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ + \\frac{(2q-5)}{(2q-4)\\beta^3} \\int \\frac{z}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-2}} \\]\n\nSubstituting now this value of \\( \\int \\frac{z}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-1}} \\) in the former equation, we have \\( \\int \\frac{M}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^q} \\) equal to\n\n\\[ \\frac{M}{(2q-2)\\beta^3} \\left( \\frac{x}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-1}} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ - \\frac{(2q-3)M}{(2q-2)(2q-4)\\beta^4} \\left( \\frac{x}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-2}} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ + \\frac{(2q-3)(2q-5)M}{(2q-2)(2q-4)\\beta^4} \\int \\frac{z}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-2}} \\]\n\nIt is easy to see, that like as we obtained an expression for the fluent of \\( \\frac{z}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-1}} \\) by substituting \\( q-1 \\) for \\( q \\), and supposing \\( M=1 \\), in the equation preceding the last; so by substituting \\( q-2 \\) for \\( q \\), we shall obtain an expression for the fluent of \\( \\frac{z}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-2}} \\), which expression will consist of two terms, one an algebraic function of \\( x \\), and the other \\( \\int \\frac{z}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-3}} \\) multiplied by a constant and given coefficient. This value of \\( \\frac{z}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-2}} \\) when substituted in the last equation will produce an expression for \\( \\int \\frac{M}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^q} \\) consisting of algebraic quantities and \\( \\int \\frac{z}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-3}} \\). By continuing this process it is evident that we shall at last have \\( \\int \\frac{M}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^q} \\) expressed by a series of algebraic quantities, and \\( \\int \\frac{z}{x^2 + \\beta^2} \\), and here we must stop, for if we repeat the process with a view to make the fluent depend on \\( \\int \\frac{z}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^q} \\), that is on \\( \\int z \\), or \\( z \\), we shall find that the coefficient of this quantity becomes infinite. As to the fluent of \\( \\frac{z}{x^2 + \\beta^2} \\) we have exhibited the expression for it in last \u00a7.\n\nIn comparing together the results which have been obtained in the preceding articles, it must appear that when a fluxion is expressed by a rational fraction, if we grant the resolution of equations, the fluent may always be assigned either algebraically, or by means of arches of a circle or logarithms; and that to prepare it for a solution, we must decompose the fraction into others whose denominators may be either binomial or trinomial quantities. This decomposition may always be effected by the method of indeterminate coefficients. There are, however, several analytical artifices by which the labour of calculation may be greatly shortened. These we now proceed to explain.\n\n115. Let us recur to the fraction \\( \\frac{U}{V} \\) and suppose that \\( x+a \\) is one of the unequal factors of the denominator \\( V \\), so that we have \\( V=(x+a)Q \\); let us now put \\( \\frac{U}{V} = \\frac{A}{x+a} + \\frac{P}{Q} \\), \\( A \\) being supposed a constant quantity, and \\( P \\) an indeterminate function of \\( x \\), but such as not to be divisible by \\( x+a \\). Then we have \\( U=AQ+P(x+a) \\), and hence \\( P=\\frac{U-AQ}{x+a} \\). As \\( P \\) is an integer function with respect to \\( x \\), it follows from this equation that \\( U-AQ \\), which is also a rational and integer function of \\( x \\), is divisible by \\( x+a \\), and consequently has \\( x+a \\) for a factor; therefore, the function \\( U-AQ \\) will vanish when we substitute \\(-a\\) in it instead of \\( x \\), seeing that \\(-a\\) is the value of \\( x \\) that makes the factor \\( x+a=0 \\). Let us denote by \\( u \\) and \\( q \\), what \\( U \\) and \\( Q \\) become by this substitution, which however will not affect the indeterminate quantity \\( A \\), because it is independent of \\( x \\). We have therefore \\( u-Aq=0 \\), and consequently \\( A=\\frac{u}{q} \\).\n\nThis value of \\( A \\) requires that we should know the function \\( Q \\) given by the equation \\( V=(x+a)Q \\), and we may always find it by dividing \\( V \\) by \\( a+x \\). The direct method of fluxions affords also a very simple method of determining it. For by taking the fluxion of the above equation we have\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{V}}{x}=Q+(x+a)\\frac{\\dot{Q}}{x} \\]\n\nif in this result we make \\( x+a=0 \\), or \\( x=-a \\), and denote by \\( v \\) what \\( \\frac{\\dot{V}}{x} \\) becomes by that substitution, we shall have \\( v=q \\), and consequently \\( A=\\frac{u}{v} \\).\n\nThe expression \\( A=\\frac{u}{q} \\) has always a finite value, for the numerator and denominator can never become \\( =0 \\), because we suppose the fraction \\( \\frac{U}{V} \\) reduced to its lowest terms, and consequently, that the numerator \\( U \\) has not for a factor \\( x+a \\), which is a factor of the denominator, but which being contained in it only once does not enter into \\( Q \\).\n\n116. Let us now consider how the numerators of the fractions, into which the proposed fraction \\( \\frac{U}{V} \\) is to be decomposed, are to be found in the case of the denominator.\nThe direct method of fluxions facilitates greatly the preceding operations. For the numerator of \\( P \\) being divisible by \\((x+a)^n\\) is necessarily of this form \\( X(x+a)^n \\), \\( X \\) being an integer function of \\( x \\), but which does not contain the factor \\( x+a \\). Now agreeably to what has been shown in \u00a7 88, the successive fluxions of this numerator, as far as the \\( n-1 \\) order inclusive, vanish when \\( x+a \\) is supposed \\( =0 \\). By giving to the numerator the following form\n\n\\[\nQ \\left( \\frac{U}{Q} - A - B(x+a) - C(x+a)^2 \\ldots \\right)\n\\]\n\nand observing that the function \\( Q \\) does not contain the factor \\( x+a \\), it is manifest that it is only the part of this expression between the parentheses which ought to be divisible by \\((x+a)^n\\). Let us put \\( \\frac{U}{Q} = Z \\), then the successive fluxions of that part are\n\n\\[\nZ - Bx - 2C(x+a)x^2 - 3D(x+a)^3x^3 \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\\[\nZ - 2C(x+a)x^2 - 3D(x+a)^3x^3 \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\\[\nZ - 2 \\cdot 3D(x+a)^3x^3 \\ldots\n\\]\n\n&c.\n\nand these results brought all to vanish when we put \\( x+a=0 \\). Thus we have\n\n\\[\nZ - A = 0, \\quad A = \\frac{u}{q},\n\\]\n\n\\[\nZ - Bx = 0, \\quad B = \\frac{Z}{x},\n\\]\n\n\\[\nZ - 2C(x+a)x^2 = 0, \\quad C = \\frac{Z}{2x^2},\n\\]\n\n\\[\nZ - 2 \\cdot 3D(x+a)^3x^3 = 0, \\quad D = \\frac{Z}{2 \\cdot 3x^3},\n\\]\n\n&c. &c.\n\nobserving that in each of these functions \\( \\frac{Z}{x}, \\frac{Z}{2x^2}, \\ldots \\) we must substitute \\(-a\\) instead of \\( x \\).\n\nThe most simple way to find the value of \\( Q \\) in this case is to divide \\( V \\) by \\((x+a)^n\\), but we may also find it by the direct method of fluxions, as in the preceding \u00a7; for, since \\( V = Q(x+a)^n \\), if we take the fluxion of each side of this equation \\( n \\) times, and then make \\( x+a=c \\), we shall find, \u00a7 88, the \\( n \\)th fluxion of \\( V \\) equal to \\( 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots n \\cdot Q \\cdot x^n \\), and consequently\n\n\\[\nQ = \\frac{n \\text{th flux. of } V}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdots n \\cdot x^n}.\n\\]\n\n117. Let us now consider how we are to find the numerator of the fraction which forms a part of \\( \\frac{U}{V} \\) when it has this form\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A(x+B)}{x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2}.\n\\]\n\nAssume\nAssume\n\n\\[ \\frac{U}{V} = \\frac{Ax + B}{x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2} + \\frac{P}{Q}; \\]\n\nthen, reducing the latter part of this equation to a common denominator, we find\n\n\\[ U = Q(Ax + B) + P(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2). \\]\n\nHence we deduce\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{U - Q(Ax + B)}{x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2}. \\]\n\nAs \\( P \\) is supposed to be an integer function with respect to \\( x \\), it follows that \\( U - Q(Ax + B) \\) is divisible by \\( x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2 \\); therefore, the former of these quantities must contain among its factors those of the latter, and the quantities, which, being substituted for \\( x \\), cause the latter to vanish, must also make the former vanish. But the factors of \\( x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2 \\) are \\( x + a + \\beta \\sqrt{-1} \\), and \\( x + a - \\beta \\sqrt{-1} \\), and these, being put each equal to zero, give us \\( x = -(a + \\beta \\sqrt{-1}) \\), and \\( x = -(a - \\beta \\sqrt{-1}) \\); therefore, each of these values of \\( x \\) being substituted in \\( U - Q(Ax + B) \\) ought to make that quantity vanish. Let us denote by \\( u = u' \\sqrt{-1} \\), and by \\( q = q' \\sqrt{-1} \\) what \\( U \\) and \\( Q \\) respectively become when \\( -(a + \\beta \\sqrt{-1}) \\) is substituted in each instead of \\( x \\), then, after this transformation, we have\n\n\\[ \\frac{u - u'}{\\sqrt{-1}} \\left\\{ -A(a + \\beta \\sqrt{-1}) + B \\right\\} = 0. \\]\n\nThis equation is twofold, because of the sign \\( \\pm \\) with which several of its terms are affected, and it is equivalent to those which would be formed by putting the real part equal to zero, and the imaginary part equal to zero; from this consideration we have\n\n\\[ u + q = A - q' \\beta A - q B = 0, \\]\n\\[ u' + q' \\beta A + q' \\beta A - q' B = 0, \\]\n\ntwo equations which give us the values of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nThe function \\( Q \\) may be found as in \u00a7 115. For, if we take the fluxions of each side of the equation\n\n\\[ Q(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2) = V, \\]\n\nand afterwards make\n\n\\[ x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2 = 0, \\]\n\nwe find \\( Q(2x + 2a) = \\dot{V} \\) and hence\n\n\\[ Q = \\frac{\\dot{V}}{2x + 2a}. \\]\n\nLet the two values of \\( x \\), to wit \\( -(a + \\beta \\sqrt{-1}) \\), be substituted instead of \\( x \\) in this equation, then, putting \\( v = v' \\sqrt{-1} \\) to denote what the expression becomes by that substitution, and writing \\( q = q' \\sqrt{-1} \\) instead of \\( Q \\), we have\n\n\\[ q = q' \\sqrt{-1} = \\frac{v - v'}{\\sqrt{-1}}, \\]\n\nwhich, by multiplying the terms of the fraction on the latter side of the equation by \\( \\sqrt{-1} \\), becomes\n\n\\[ q = q' \\sqrt{-1} = \\frac{v - v'}{\\sqrt{-1}}. \\]\n\nHence, by putting the real part of each side of this equation equal to each other, and also the imaginary parts equal to each other, we find\n\n\\[ q = -\\frac{v'}{\\beta}, \\quad q' = \\frac{v}{\\beta}. \\]\n\n118. If the factor \\( x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2 \\) is found several times in the denominator of \\( V \\), so that\n\n\\[ V = Q(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2)^n, \\]\n\nthen, \u00a7 113, we assume in this case\n\n\\[ \\frac{U}{V} \\text{ equal to } \\frac{Ax + B}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2)^n} + \\frac{A'x + B'}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2)^n-1} + \\cdots + \\frac{P}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2)^n}. \\]\n\nReducing this expression to a common denominator, and ordering the equation as to bring \\( P \\) to stand alone on one side, we find \\( P \\) equal to\n\n\\[ U - Q \\left\\{ \\frac{Ax + B + (A'x + B')(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2)}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2)^n} + \\cdots \\right\\}. \\]\n\nBy reasoning in this as in the preceding case, it may be concluded that the numerator of this expression ought to vanish when \\( -(a + \\beta \\sqrt{-1}) \\) is substituted in it instead of \\( x \\); therefore, putting \\( u = u' \\sqrt{-1} \\), and \\( q = q' \\sqrt{-1} \\) to denote the same things as before, we deduce from that substitution\n\n\\[ \\frac{u - u'}{\\sqrt{-1}} \\left\\{ -A(a + \\beta \\sqrt{-1}) + B \\right\\} = 0. \\]\n\nThe very same equation for the determination of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), as we have already found in last \u00a7.\n\nHaving found the values of these quantities, they may be substituted in the numerator of \\( P \\), and the terms \\( U - Q(Ax + B) \\) becoming divisible by \\( x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2 \\), the whole expression becomes divisible by the same quantity. Calling therefore \\( U' \\) the quotient arising from the division of \\( U - Q(Ax + B) \\) by \\( x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2 \\), we have \\( P \\) equal to\n\n\\[ U' - Q \\left\\{ \\frac{Ax + B + (A'x + B')(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2)}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2)^n} \\right\\}. \\]\n\nIf in this numerator we substitute instead of \\( x \\) its values deduced from the equation \\( x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2 = 0 \\), and put the result \\( = 0 \\), we may determine \\( A' \\) and \\( B' \\) in the very same way that we have already determined \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), and by proceeding in this manner we shall find the remaining coefficients \\( A'' \\), \\( B'' \\), &c.\n\nThis case is quite analogous to that which has been already treated in \u00a7 116, and the direct method of fluxions applies to it in the same manner as to the other. For since \\( Q \\) does not contain the factor \\( x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2 \\), if the numerator of \\( P \\) be divided by the function \\( Q \\), the result, which may be denoted by \\( r \\), ought to be of this form\nform \\( r = X(x^3 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2) \\) and consequently ought to vanish, as well as all its fluxions, from the first order to the \\( n-1 \\) order, inclusively, when \\( x^3 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2 = 0 \\); this being the case, we have these equations\n\n\\[ r = c, \\quad r' = 0, \\quad r'' = 0, \\ldots \\]\n\nand so on to the \\( n-1 \\) fluxion of \\( r \\), which ought also to be \\( = 0 \\); each of these equations becomes twofold when we substitute instead of \\( x \\), the values of which it is susceptible in consequence of the equation \\( x^3 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2 = 0 \\). By putting the real and the imaginary parts separately \\( = 0 \\), we shall obtain as many equations as are sufficient to determine \\( A, B, A', B' \\), &c.\n\nIt may also be remarked, that from the equation\n\n\\[ V = Q(x^3 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2) \\]\n\nwe find \\( Q \\) equal to the quotient arising from the division of the \\( n \\)th fluxion of \\( V \\) by the \\( n \\)th fluxion of \\( x^3 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2 \\), observing to assume\n\n\\[ x^3 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2 = 0. \\]\n\n119. We shall now give some applications of what has been said relative to the fluents of rational fractions. Suppose the fraction to be\n\n\\[ \\frac{x^8 + x^7 - x^4 - x}{x^8 + x^7 - x^4 - x} ; \\]\n\nThe factors of its denominator are easily found, for it may be put under this form\n\n\\[ x^3(x^5 + x^4 - x - 1) = x^3(x + 1)(x^4 - 1), \\]\n\nthe factor \\( x^4 - 1 \\) may be decomposed into \\( x^2 - 1 \\) and \\( x^2 + 1 \\), or \\( x - 1, x + 1, \\) and \\( x^2 + 1 \\), thus we have the denominator equal to\n\n\\[ x^3(x - 1)(x + 1)^2(x^2 + 1) \\]\n\ntherefore (\\$ 111, \u00a7 112, and \u00a7 113.) the proposed fraction is to be decomposed as follows\n\n\\[ \\frac{A}{x - 1} + \\frac{B}{(x + 1)^2} + \\frac{C}{x + 1} + \\frac{D}{x^2} + \\frac{E}{x^3} + \\frac{F}{x^4} + \\frac{(Gx + H)}{x^5} \\]\n\nBy reducing these fractions to a common denominator, and comparing the numerator of their sum with that of the proposed fraction, we might determine the unknown quantities \\( A, B, C, \\) &c. we shall, however, rather employ the methods that have just been explained.\n\nBy comparing this particular example\n\n\\[ \\frac{x^8 + x^7 - x^4 - x^3}{x^8 + x^7 - x^4 - x^3} \\]\n\nwith the general expression \\( \\frac{U}{V} \\), it appears that \\( U = 1 \\), and \\( V = x^8 + x^7 - x^4 - x^3 \\). First let us investigate the numerator of the fraction \\( \\frac{A}{x - 1} \\), and for this purpose we employ the formula \\( A = \\frac{u}{v} \\) (\\$ 115.). As we have \\( U = 1 \\), it is evident that \\( u = 1 \\); and since \\( V = x^8 + x^7 - x^4 - x^3 \\)\n\n\\[ -x^4 - x^3, \\text{ therefore } \\frac{V}{x} = 8x^7 + 7x^6 - 4x^3 - 3x^4. \\]\n\nIf in this expression we substitute \\( -1 \\) instead of \\( x \\) (viz. the value of \\( x \\) deduced from the equation \\( x - 1 = 0 \\)) we find the result to be 8, therefore \\( v = 8 \\). So that\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{u}{v} = \\frac{1}{8}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{A}{x - 1} = \\frac{1}{8}. \\]\n\nLet us next investigate the values of \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) in the fractions \\( \\frac{B}{(x + 1)^2} \\) and \\( \\frac{C}{x + 1} \\), by means of the rule of \u00a7 116, and that we may make the symbols expressing the quantity under consideration agree with those employed in that formula, let us exchange the letters \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), so that we are to consider\n\n\\[ \\frac{A}{(x + 1)^2} + \\frac{B}{x + 1}. \\]\n\nIn the first place we have\n\n\\[ Q = \\frac{x^8 + x^7 - x^4 - x^3}{(x + 1)^2} = x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3; \\]\n\nPut \\( x + 1 = 0 \\), then \\( x = -1 \\); substituting now this value of \\( x \\) in the value of \\( Q \\), the result is \\( 4 = 9 \\), therefore \\( A = \\frac{u}{q} = \\frac{1}{4} \\). Let this value of \\( A \\) be substituted for \\( A \\) in the expression for \\( U' \\) in the \u00a7 above cited, and we have\n\n\\[ U' = \\frac{U - AQ}{x + 1} = \\frac{4 - x^6 + x^5 - x^4 + x^3}{4(x + 1)} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{-x^8 + 2x^7 - 3x^6 + 4x^5 - 4x^4 + 4}{4} \\]\n\nHence putting \\( -1 \\) instead of \\( x \\) in the expression for \\( U' \\), we have \\( u' = \\frac{9}{2} \\) and \\( B = \\frac{9}{8} \\). Thus the two fractions under consideration are found to be \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(x + 1)^2} \\) and \\( \\frac{9}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x + 1} \\). We might have deduced the value of \\( B \\) from the formula \\( B = \\frac{Z}{x} \\), \u00a7 116, where \\( Z \\) is put for \\( \\frac{U}{Q} \\) for we have\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{U}{Q} = \\frac{x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3}{x^8 + x^7 - x^4 - x^3} \\]\n\nand \\( \\frac{Z}{x} = \\frac{6x^8 - 5x^7 + 4x^6 - 3x^5}{(x^8 + x^7 - x^4 - x^3)^2} \\).\n\nIf in this expression we substitute \\( -1 \\) instead of \\( x \\), it becomes \\( \\frac{18}{16} = \\frac{9}{8} \\), the same value for \\( B \\) as before.\n\nLet us now consider the fractions \\( \\frac{D}{x^2} + \\frac{E}{x^3} + \\frac{F}{x^4} \\), or exchanging the symbols \\( D, E, F \\) for \\( A, B, C \\),\n\n\\[ \\frac{A}{x^2} + \\frac{B}{x^3} + \\frac{C}{x^4}. \\]\n\nThe numerators \\( A, B, C \\) may all be found from these formulas of \u00a7 116.\nThe union of all the algebraic terms produces the fraction \\(\\frac{2-2x-5x^2}{4x^2(1+x)}\\), and that of the logarithmic quantities gives\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{8}l.(x-1) + \\frac{1}{8}l.(x+1) + l.(x+1)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{8}l.\\left(\\frac{x^2-1}{x^2+1}\\right) + l.\\left(\\frac{x+1}{x}\\right).\n\\]\n\nWe have therefore upon the whole \\(f(x^6+x^7-x^4-x^3)\\) equal to\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2-2x-5x^2}{4x^2(1+x)} + \\frac{1}{8}l.\\left(\\frac{x^2-1}{x^2+1}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n+ l.\\left(\\frac{x+1}{x}\\right) - \\frac{1}{4} \\text{arc (tan. } x) + \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\n120. When a fluxion is a rational fraction having either of these forms\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^m}{x^n+a^n}, \\quad \\frac{x^m}{x^n+2\\rho a^n x^n+a^n},\n\\]\n\nwe can always, by the application of a particular theorem in analysis, resolve its denominator into real factors of the first and second degrees. The theorem to which we allude is this. Let \\(n\\) be any positive integer, and let \\(z\\) denote any arch of a circle, of which the radius is unity, then\n\n\\[\n(\\text{cof. } z = \\sqrt{-1} \\text{ fin. } z)^n = \\text{cof. } n z = \\sqrt{-1} \\text{ fin. } n z.\n\\]\n\nWe proceed to prove this theorem. Because\n\n\\[\n(\\text{cof. } z + \\sqrt{-1} \\text{ fin. } z)(\\text{cof. } z - \\sqrt{-1} \\text{ fin. } z)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\text{cof. } z + \\text{fin. } z = 1.\n\\]\n\nIf we put \\(\\text{cof. } z = \\sqrt{-1} \\text{ fin. } z = v\\),\n\nThen \\(\\text{cof. } z = \\sqrt{-1} \\text{ fin. } z = \\frac{1}{v}\\);\n\nTherefore taking the sum of these two equations,\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ cof. } z = v + \\frac{1}{v}.\n\\]\n\nNow by the arithmetic of lines (Algebra, \u00a7 358.)\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ cof. } 2 z = 2 (\\text{cof. } z \\times \\text{cof. } z - 1),\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ cof. } 3 z = 2 (\\text{cof. } z \\times \\text{cof. } 2 z - \\text{cof. } z),\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ cof. } 4 z = 2 (\\text{cof. } z \\times \\text{cof. } 3 z - \\text{cof. } 2 z),\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ cof. } 5 z = 2 (\\text{cof. } z \\times \\text{cof. } 4 z - \\text{cof. } 3 z).\n\\]\n\n&c.\n\nTherefore, substituting in the first of these equations \\(v + \\frac{1}{v}\\) instead of \\(2 \\text{ cof. } z\\), we have\n\\[2 \\text{ cof. } 2 z = (v + \\frac{1}{v})(v + \\frac{1}{v}) - 2\\]\n\n\\[= v^2 + \\frac{1}{v^2}.\\]\n\nIn like manner, substituting in the second equation, \\(v + \\frac{1}{v}\\) instead of \\(2 \\text{ cof. } z\\), and \\(v^2 + \\frac{1}{v^2}\\) instead of \\(2 \\text{ cof. } 2 z\\), we have\n\n\\[2 \\text{ cof. } 3 z = (v + \\frac{1}{v})(v^2 + \\frac{1}{v^2}) - (v + \\frac{1}{v})\\]\n\n\\[= v^3 + \\frac{1}{v^3}.\\]\n\nProceeding in the same way with the third and following equations, we find\n\n\\[2 \\text{ cof. } 4 z = v^4 + \\frac{1}{v^4},\\]\n\n\\[2 \\text{ cof. } 5 z = v^5 + \\frac{1}{v^5};\\]\n\nso that we may conclude in general that\n\n\\[2 \\text{ cof. } n z = v^n + \\frac{1}{v^n};\\]\n\nHence we have this quadratic equation\n\n\\[v^n - 2 \\text{ cof. } n z \\times v^n + 1 = 0,\\]\n\nfrom which, by completing the square, we find\n\n\\[v^n = \\text{ cof. } n z \\pm \\sqrt{(\\text{ cof. } n z - 1)};\\]\n\ntherefore, by substituting for \\(v\\) the quantity it was put to represent, and observing that \\(\\sqrt{(\\text{ cof. } n z - 1)} = \\sqrt{(-\\sin^2 n z)} = \\sqrt{-1} \\sin n z\\), we have\n\n\\[(\\text{ cof. } z \\pm \\sqrt{-1} \\sin n z)^n = \\text{ cof. } n z \\pm \\sqrt{-1} \\sin n z,\\]\n\nas was to be proved.\n\n121. The function \\(x^n = a_n\\) is transformed to \\(a^n(y^n = 1)\\) by putting \\(x = ay\\), and to discover its factors, we must resolve the equation\n\n\\[y^n = 1 = 0.\\]\n\nThe expression \\(y = \\text{ cof. } z + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin n z\\) satisfies this equation, by a very simple determination of the arch \\(z\\); for we have \\(y^n = (\\text{ cof. } z + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin n z)^n = \\text{ cof. } n z + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin n z\\), and as by putting \\(z\\) to denote half the circumference, and \\(m\\) any whole number, we have (Algebra, \u00a7 352)\n\n\\[\\sin m z = 0, \\text{ cof. } m z = \\pm 1,\\]\n\nwhere the sign \\(+\\) is to be taken, if \\(m\\) be an even number, but \\(-\\) if it be odd, we have only to suppose \\(n z = m z\\), in order to obtain \\(y^n = \\pm 1\\).\n\nThat we may distinguish the case in which \\(m\\) is even,\n\n\\[n z = 2m \\pi, \\text{ and } n z = (2m + 1) \\pi.\\]\n\nBy the first hypothesis, we find\n\n\\[y^n = +1, y = \\text{ cof. } \\frac{2m \\pi}{n} + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\frac{2m \\pi}{n},\\]\n\nand by the second\n\n\\[y^n = -1,\\]\n\n\\[y = \\text{ cof. } \\frac{(2m + 1) \\pi}{n} + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\frac{(2m + 1) \\pi}{n}.\\]\n\n122. By means of the indeterminate number \\(n\\), each of these expressions for \\(y\\) furnishes all the values of which this quantity is susceptible, for we may take successively\n\n\\[m = 0, m = 1, m = 2, m = 3, \\text{ &c.}\\]\n\nThe first formula gives\n\n\\[y = \\text{ cof. } 0.z = 1\\]\n\n\\[y = \\text{ cof. } \\frac{2\\pi}{n} + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\frac{2\\pi}{n},\\]\n\n\\[y = \\text{ cof. } \\frac{4\\pi}{n} + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\frac{4\\pi}{n},\\]\n\n&c.\n\nIt is evident that we shall always have different results as far as \\(m = n - 1\\). If, however we suppose \\(m = n\\); then we have \\(y = \\text{ cof. } 2 = 1 \\pi\\), which is the same as the first of the values already obtained, and if we suppose \\(m = n + 1\\), then (Algebra, \u00a7 25.)\n\n\\[\\text{ Cof. } \\frac{(2n + 2)\\pi}{n} = \\text{ cof. } (2\\pi + \\frac{2\\pi}{n}) = \\text{ cof. } \\frac{2\\pi}{n},\\]\n\n\\[\\text{ Sin. } \\frac{(2n + 2)\\pi}{n} = \\text{ fin. } (2\\pi + \\frac{2\\pi}{n}) = \\text{ fin. } \\frac{2\\pi}{n},\\]\n\nwhich is the same as the second value, and so on with respect to the others.\n\nBy this mode of proceeding we shall not only obtain the \\(n\\) roots of the equation \\(y^n = 1\\), or \\(y^n - 1 = 0\\), but, with a little attention, we shall discover that these roots may be arranged in pairs, by bringing together those that only differ in the sign of the radical \\(\\sqrt{-1}\\); for since\n\n\\[\\text{ Cof. } (2\\pi - p) = \\text{ cof. } p, \\text{ and fin. } (2\\pi - p) = -\\text{ fin. } p,\\]\n\nit follows that\n\n\\[y = \\text{ cof. } \\frac{(2n - 2m)\\pi}{n} + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\frac{(2n - 2m)\\pi}{n}\\]\n\n\\[= \\text{ cof. } \\frac{2m\\pi}{n} - \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\frac{2m\\pi}{n}.\\]\n\nHence it appears that we may comprehend all the roots of the equation \\(y^n - 1 = 0\\) in the single expressions\nby giving to \\( m \\) only these values\n\n\\[ 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, \\frac{n}{2}, \\]\n\nif \\( n \\) is even, and these values\n\n\\[ 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, \\frac{n-1}{2}, \\]\n\nif \\( n \\) is odd; and it may be observed that in the former case the last value of \\( y \\) is\n\n\\[ y = \\text{cof. } \\pi = -1, \\]\n\nbecause then the equation \\( y^n - 1 = 0 \\) has two real roots.\n\nThe two values comprehended in the formula,\n\n\\[ y = \\text{cof. } \\frac{2m\\pi}{n} + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\frac{2m\\pi}{n}, \\]\n\ngive for factors of the first degree of the quantity \\( y^n - 1 \\), the two imaginary expressions\n\n\\[ y - (\\text{cof. } \\frac{2m\\pi}{n} + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\frac{2m\\pi}{n}), \\]\n\\[ y - (\\text{cof. } \\frac{2m\\pi}{n} - \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\frac{2m\\pi}{n}), \\]\n\nand the product of these is the expression\n\n\\[ y^2 - 2y \\text{cof. } \\frac{2m\\pi}{n} + 1, \\]\n\nwhich comprehends all the real factors of the second degree.\n\nAs an example of the formula\n\n\\[ y = \\text{cof. } \\frac{2m\\pi}{n} + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\frac{2m\\pi}{n}, \\]\n\nthe simple factors, or those of the first degree, contained in the function \\( y^6 - 1 \\) will be\n\n\\[ y - 1, \\]\n\\[ y - (\\text{cof. } \\frac{2\\pi}{6} + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\frac{2\\pi}{6}), \\]\n\\[ y - (\\text{cof. } \\frac{4\\pi}{6} + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\frac{4\\pi}{6}), \\]\n\\[ y + 1. \\]\n\nThe formula\n\n\\[ y^2 - 2y \\text{cof. } \\frac{2m\\pi}{n} + 1 \\]\n\ngives as factors of the second degree\n\n\\[ y^2 - 2y + 1, \\]\n\\[ y^2 - 2y \\text{cof. } \\frac{2\\pi}{6} + 1, \\]\n\\[ y^2 - 2y \\text{cof. } \\frac{4\\pi}{6} + 1, \\]\n\\[ y^2 + 2y + 1. \\]\n\nThe first and the last of the factors of the second degree are the squares of \\( y - 1 \\) and \\( y + 1 \\), factors of the first degree each of which only enters once into the proposed function; it will therefore be necessary, when we employ the factors of the second degree, to reject the first and last, and take instead of them\n\n\\[ (y - 1)(y + 1) = y^2 - 1. \\]\n\nThe factors of the first degree of the function \\( y^5 - 1 \\) are\n\n\\[ y - 1, \\]\n\\[ y - (\\text{cof. } \\frac{2\\pi}{5} + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\frac{2\\pi}{5}), \\]\n\\[ y - (\\text{cof. } \\frac{4\\pi}{5} + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\frac{4\\pi}{5}). \\]\n\nThose of the second degree are\n\n\\[ y^2 - 2y + 1, \\]\n\\[ y^2 - 2y \\text{cof. } \\frac{2\\pi}{5} + 1, \\]\n\\[ y^2 - 2y \\text{cof. } \\frac{4\\pi}{5} + 1; \\]\n\nbut it is to be observed that the first factor of the second degree is the square of \\( y - 1 \\), which enters only once into the proposed function.\n\n123.

When a fluxionary expression involves irrational functions, we must endeavour either to transform it into another that is rational, or to reduce it to a series of irrational terms of this form \\( A x^n \\), and then, in either case its fluent may be found by the rules already delivered.\n\nLet us take for example the fluxion\n\n\\[ \\frac{(1 + \\sqrt{x} - 3\\sqrt{x^2})}{1 + 3\\sqrt{x}}. \\]\n\nIt is evident that by putting \\( x = z^6 \\), all the extractions indicated by the radical signs may be effected, and the fluxion may be transformed to\n\n\\[ \\frac{6z^5(1 + z^3 - z^4)z}{1 + z^3}, \\]\n\nwhich, by dividing the numerator by \\( 1 + z^3 \\), may be otherwise expressed thus,\n\n\\[ -6(z^7 - z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 - z^2 - z). \\]\n\nThe fluent of which is\n\n\\[ -6 \\left\\{ \\frac{z^8}{8} - \\frac{z^7}{7} - \\frac{z^6}{6} + \\frac{z^5}{5} - \\frac{z^3}{3} \\right\\} + \\text{const}. \\]\n126. We shall first consider such fluxions as contain the irrational function \\( \\sqrt{(A+Bx+Cx^2)} \\), and which have necessarily one or other of these forms\n\n\\[\n\\frac{X}{\\sqrt{(A+Bx+Cx^2)}} = \\frac{X}{\\sqrt{(A+Bx+Cx^2)}}.\n\\]\n\n\\( X \\) being put for any rational function of \\( x \\); and it may be remarked, that the latter form comprehends the former, which may be written thus\n\n\\[\n\\frac{X}{\\sqrt{(A+Bx+Cx^2)}} \\times \\sqrt{(A+Bx+Cx^2)} = \\frac{X}{\\sqrt{(A+Bx+Cx^2)}}.\n\\]\n\nand here the numerator of the fluxion is a rational function of \\( x \\).\n\nBefore we transform the expression \\( \\sqrt{(A+Bx+Cx^2)} \\) into another that is rational with respect to the variable quantity it contains, we shall put the quantity \\( A+Bx+Cx^2 \\) under this form\n\n\\[\nC\\left(\\frac{A}{C} + \\frac{B}{C} x + x^2\\right);\n\\]\n\nand, in order to abridge, we shall put\n\n\\[\nC = c, \\quad \\frac{A}{C} = a, \\quad \\frac{B}{C} = b,\n\\]\n\nthen we have\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(A+Bx+Cx^2)} = c\\sqrt{(a+bx+x^2)}.\n\\]\n\nLet us now assume \\( \\sqrt{(a+bx+x^2)} = z + x \\), then squaring both sides of the equation, we find \\( a+bx = 2xz+x^2 \\), hence we get \\( x = \\frac{a-z^2}{2z-b} \\), and consequently\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(A+Bx+Cx^2)} = c(z+x) = c\\left(\\frac{a-bz+z^2}{2z-b}\\right).\n\\]\n\nBy means of these values the fluxion \\( \\frac{X}{\\sqrt{(A+Bx+Cx^2)}} \\) is transformed into another fluxion \\( Z \\dot{z} \\), where \\( Z \\) denotes a rational function of \\( z \\), which is real when \\( C \\) or \\( c \\) is positive; but as when \\( C \\) is negative \\( c \\) becomes imaginary, the fluxion \\( Z \\dot{z} \\) which involves \\( c \\) becomes also imaginary.\n\nIn this case we have to consider \\( \\sqrt{(A+Bx-Cx^2)} \\), and making\n\n\\[\nC = c, \\quad \\frac{A}{C} = a, \\quad \\frac{B}{C} = b,\n\\]\n\nit becomes \\( c\\sqrt{(a+bx-x^2)} \\). The quantity \\( x^2-bx-a \\) may always be decomposed into real factors of the first degree; let us represent these factors by \\( x-\\alpha \\), and \\( x-\\beta \\), then it is evident that\n\n\\[\na+bx-x^2 = (x-\\alpha)(x-\\beta).\n\\]\n\nLet us now assume\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x-\\alpha)(x-\\beta)} = (x-\\alpha)x,\n\\]\n\nthen, squaring both sides of the equation it becomes divisible by \\( x-\\alpha \\), and we have \\( x-\\alpha = (x-\\alpha)x^2 \\), from which we find\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{a-z^2}{z^2+1}, \\quad (x-z) = \\frac{(a-z^2)}{z^2+1},\n\\]\n\nvalues which render the proposed fluxion \\( \\frac{X}{\\sqrt{(A+Bx-Cx^2)}} \\) rational.\n\n127. Let us now take for example the fluxion \\( \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(A+Bx+Cx^2)}} \\); by applying to it the first of the preceding transformations it becomes \\( \\frac{-2z}{c(2z-b)} \\), the fluent of which is \\( -\\frac{1}{c} \\cdot l.(2z-b) + \\text{conf} \\).

As it is not possible, in every case, to express in finite terms the formula \\( \\int x^{m-1} \\cdot \\frac{x}{(a + bx^n)^q} \\), we may try to reduce it to its most simple case, as we have done.\nPart II.\n\nInverse Method. done with respect to \\( \\int \\frac{\\dot{v}}{(x^2 + b^2)^q} \\) in \u00a7 114, which we have succeeded in reducing to \\( \\int \\frac{\\dot{v}}{x^2 + b^2} \\). To effect this reduction, we remark, that, since when \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) denote any functions of a variable quantity, the fluxion of \\( uv \\) is \\( u \\dot{v} + v \\dot{u}, (\\$ 37.) \\) therefore \\( \\int u \\dot{v} = u - \\int v \\dot{u} \\). Now if we can decompose the expression \\( x^{m-n-1} \\cdot (a + bx^n)^p \\) into two factors such, that we can find the fluent of one of them, then, denoting that factor by \\( v \\), and the other by \\( u \\), the fluent of the proposed fluxion will be made to depend on that of \\( v \\dot{u} \\), which in some cases will be more simple than the proposed fluxion.

This result coincides with what we have already found, \u00a7 129.\n\n131. We may also obtain a reduction, by which the exponent \\( p \\) shall be diminished by unity.

It is evident, that if \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) were negative, the formulas (A) and (B) would not answer the purpose for which they have been investigated, because, in that case they would increase the exponents instead of diminishing them.

Let the fluxion be \\( \\frac{a \\dot{x}}{a^2 + x^2} \\), which may be put under this form \\( \\frac{\\dot{x}}{1 + \\frac{x^2}{a^2}} \\), and which consequently belongs to the arch of which the tangent \\( = \\frac{x}{a} \\) (\u00a7 60).

The determination of this number is of great importance in every branch of mathematics.\n\n138. By proceeding with the fluxion \\( \\frac{x^m \\dot{x}}{a^n + x^n} \\), in the same manner as we have done with \\( \\frac{a \\dot{x}}{a^2 + x^2} \\), we get\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{x^m \\dot{x}}{a^n + x^n} = \\frac{x^{m+1}}{(m+1)a^n} - \\frac{x^{m+n+1}}{(m+n+1)a^{2n}} + \\frac{x^{m+2n+1}}{(m+2n+1)a^{3n}} + \\ldots + \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\nThis series proceeds by the positive powers of \\( x \\), or is an ascending series, but we may also expand \\( \\frac{1}{a^n + x^n} \\) into a series proceeding by the negative powers of \\( x \\), and which will therefore be called a descending series. Thus because\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^n + a^n}\n\\]\nwe have, after multiplying both sides by \\( x^m \\) and taking the fluents\n\n\\[\n\\int x^m \\frac{dx}{x^n + a^n} = \\frac{1}{(n-m-1)x^{n-m-1}} + \\frac{a^n}{(2n-m-1)x^{2n-m-1}} + \\frac{a^2 n}{(3n-m-1)x^{3n-m-1}} + \\text{&c.} + \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\nThis last series will be convergent when \\( x \\) is greater than \\( a \\), and at the same time \\( m < n \\). But besides, that it may contain algebraic terms only, it is necessary that none of the divisors \\( n-m-1, 2n-m-1, 3n-m-1, \\) &c. become \\( = 0 \\); this circumstance will take place as often as \\( m+1 \\) is a multiple of \\( n \\), and in which case\n\nthe series \\( \\frac{x^m}{x^n - a^n} + \\text{&c.} \\) which is the development of the fluxion will contain a term of this form \\( \\frac{a^n}{x^n} \\), the fluent of which is \\( a^n \\cdot 1 \\cdot x \\).\n\nIf in this result we put \\( m = 0, n = 2, \\) and \\( a = 1 \\) we get\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{dx}{1+x^2} = \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{3x^3} - \\frac{1}{5x^5} + \\text{&c.} + \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\nBut although the expression \\( \\frac{x}{1+x^2} \\) is the fluxion of the arch having \\( x \\) for its tangent, we must not conclude that this series is the development of that arch, for \\( x \\) being supposed \\( = 0 \\), each of the terms of the series becomes infinite.\n\nThe consideration of the constant quantity added to the fluent will remove this apparent difficulty, if we remark, that to know the true value of a series, it is always necessary to begin with the case in which it is convergent. Now the series\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{3x^3} - \\frac{1}{5x^5} + \\text{&c.}\n\\]\n\nconverges so much the faster as \\( x \\) is greater, and it vanishes when \\( x \\) is infinite; but in this extreme case the equation\n\n\\[\n\\arctan(x) = \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{3x^3} - \\frac{1}{5x^5} + \\text{&c.} + \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\nbecomes simply \\( \\arctan(x) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\text{const.} \\) where \\( \\pi \\) denotes half the circumference of the circle; therefore, substituting this value of the constant quantity, we have\n\n\\[\n\\arctan(x) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{3x^3} - \\frac{1}{5x^5} + \\text{&c.}\n\\]\n\nWe may easily find an expression for the fluent of the rational fraction \\( \\frac{Ux}{V} \\) (\\$ III.) by expanding the quantity \\( \\frac{U}{V} \\) into a series, but the result thus obtained is in general very complicated, and seldom convergent; besides, this manner of finding the fluent is hardly of any use, since it may be expressed by means of arches of a circle and logarithms, both of which are readily obtained from the common trigonometrical tables.\n\n139. The fluent of \\( x^m - x \\cdot (a + bx^n)^{\\frac{p}{q}} \\) is easily obtained by first expanding the quantity \\( (a + bx^n)^{\\frac{p}{q}} \\) into a series by the binomial theorem, then multiplying each term of that series by \\( x^{m-1} \\cdot x \\), and taking the fluents of the results by \u00a7 101. Thus we have\n\n\\[\n\\int x^m - x \\cdot (a + bx^n)^{\\frac{p}{q}} = \\frac{p}{q} \\left\\{ \\frac{x^m}{m} + \\frac{pb}{qa} \\frac{x^{m+n}}{m+n} + \\frac{b(p-q)b^3}{1.2.q^3.a^3} \\frac{x^{m+2n}}{m+2n} + \\frac{b(p-q)(p-2q)b^3}{1.2.3.q^3.a^3} \\frac{x^{m+3n}}{m+3n} + \\text{&c.} \\right\\} + \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\nThis is an ascending series, but to get a descending series we must divide \\( (a + bx^n)^{\\frac{p}{q}} \\) by \\( x^q \\) and multiply \\( x^{m-1} \\cdot x \\), the remaining part of the fluxional expression by the same quantity, thus the fluxion is transformed to\n\n\\[\nx^{m+\\frac{n}{q}-1} \\cdot x \\cdot (b + ax^n)^{\\frac{p}{q}}\n\\]\n\nthe fluent of which, by proceeding as in the former case, is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p}{q} \\left\\{ \\frac{m+\\frac{n}{q}}{mq+np} \\cdot \\frac{pa}{qb} \\frac{x^{m+\\frac{(p-q)n}{q}}}{mq+(p-q)n} + \\frac{b(p-q)a^2}{1.2.q^2.b^2} \\frac{x^{m+\\frac{(p-q)n}{q}}}{mq+(p-q)n} + \\text{&c.} \\right\\} + \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\neither of these series may be employed if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are both positive, or \\( q \\) an odd number, but if \\( q \\) be an even number, the first formula becomes imaginary on account of the factor \\( a^q \\) if \\( a^p \\) be negative, and the same thing happens to the second formula if \\( a^p \\) be negative.\n\n140. Let it be required to express by a series the fluent of \\( \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\). That we may develop the radical quantity \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\) we put it under this form\nInverse Method.\n\n\\[(1-x^2)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\] an expression which when expanded by the binomial theorem is\n\n\\[1 + \\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \\frac{1}{24}x^4 + \\frac{1}{240}x^6 + \\&c.\\]\n\ntherefore, multiplying each term of this series by \\(x\\) and taking the fluent, we get\n\n\\[\\int \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}} = x + \\frac{1}{2}x^3 + \\frac{1}{24}x^5 + \\frac{1}{240}x^7 + \\&c.\\]\n\nIf we suppose \\(x\\) to denote the sine of an arch, then \\(\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}\\) is its cosine, and \\(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}}\\) is the fluxion of the arch itself (\\$59.). Therefore the series which we have just found expresses the length of the arch of a circle, radius being unity, and the sine of the arch \\(x\\). If we suppose the series to express the final left arch that corresponds to the sine \\(x\\), then, as when the sine of that arch \\(=0\\), the arch itself \\(=0\\), the series expressing the arch must vanish when \\(x=0\\), therefore we must suppress the constant quantity added to complete the fluent; or suppose it \\(=0\\). The same series has already been found by the direct method of fluxions in \u00a772.\n\nLet \\(x\\) denote the same as in \u00a7137, then, as the sine of 30 degrees, or of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) radians, we have, by substituting \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) instead of \\(x\\) in the preceding series, and multiplying both sides by 6,\n\n\\[=3 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{24} \\cdot \\frac{1}{24} \\cdot \\frac{1}{24} + \\&c.\\right)\\]\n\nby means of this series, which involves only rational numbers, we may compute (but with more labour), the value of \\(\\pi\\) as before.\n\nSuppose the fluxion to be \\(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(ax-x^2)}}\\), which may be otherwise expressed thus, \\(\\frac{x}{a} \\cdot \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(1-\\frac{x^2}{a})}}\\).

By resolving a fluxion into an infinite series, the object in view is to transform it into a series of other fluxions, each of which may have its fluent determined by known methods; but it is not always necessary that the terms of the series should be each simply a power of \\(x\\) multiplied by \\(x\\) and constant quantities.\n\nIf for example we have this fluxion\n\n\\[\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(1-e^2x^2)}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}}\\]\n\nin which \\(e\\) is supposed to denote a small constant quantity, we may expand \\(\\sqrt{(1-e^2x^2)}\\) or \\((1-e^2x^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) into a series, which will thus become\n\n\\[1 - \\frac{e^2x^2}{2} - \\frac{1}{24}e^4x^4 - \\frac{1}{240}e^6x^6 + \\&c.\\]\n\nand the fluxion \\(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(1-e^2x^2)}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}}\\) will be transformed to\n\n\\[\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}} \\left\\{1 - \\frac{e^2x^2}{2} - \\frac{1}{24}e^4x^4 - \\frac{1}{240}e^6x^6 + \\&c.\\right\\}\\]\n\nthe series will converge very fast when \\(e\\) is small, for that \\(\\sqrt{(1-e^2x^2)}\\) may be a real quantity, \\(e^2\\) must be less than 1. We must now multiply each term of the series by the common factor \\(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}}\\) and take the fluents, which being all contained in the general expression\n\n\\[\\int \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}}\\]\n\nwill be found by \u00a7133.

Let it be required to find the fluent of \\(x^m \\cdot \\log(x)\\), where \\(x\\) denotes the Napierian logarithm of \\(x\\). In this case, as well as in some following examples, we shall have recourse to the principle already employed in \u00a7139, namely, that if \\(v\\) and \\(z\\) denote any functions of a variable quantity \\(x\\), then\n\n\\[\\int x^m \\cdot \\log(x) = \\int v \\cdot z.\\]\n\nLet us therefore assume \\(x^m \\cdot \\log(x) = v\\), and \\(1 \\cdot x = z\\), then, (\\$101), \\(x^{m+1} = v\\), and (\\$57), \\(x = z\\), therefore, substituting\nPart II.\n\nInverting substituting these values of \\( v, z, \\dot{v}, \\dot{z} \\) in the formula it becomes\n\n\\[\n\\int x^m \\dot{x} (1, x) = \\frac{x^{m+1}}{m+1} - \\int \\frac{x^m \\dot{x}}{m+1},\n\\]\n\nor, since \\( \\int \\frac{x^m \\dot{x}}{m+1} = \\frac{x^{m+1}}{(m+1)^2} + \\text{const.} \\),\n\n\\[\n\\int x^m \\dot{x} (1, x) = x^{m+1} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{m+1} - \\frac{1}{(m+1)^2} \\right\\} + \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\nLet us next suppose that the proposed fluxion is \\( x^m \\dot{x} (1, x)^n \\). Put \\( x^m \\dot{x} = v \\), and \\( (1, x)^n = z \\), then (\\$101.)\n\n\\[\n\\frac{w^{m+1}}{m+1} = v, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{n x^{m+1}}{m+1} = z,\n\\]\n\ntherefore, substituting as before these values in the formula \\( \\int z \\dot{v} = vz - \\int v \\dot{z} \\), we get\n\n\\[\n\\int x^m \\dot{x} (1, x)^n = \\frac{x^{m+1}}{m+1} (1, x)^{n-1} - \\int \\frac{n x^m \\dot{x} (1, x)^{n-1}}{m+1}.\n\\]\n\nIt is evident that by this formula the determination of the fluent of \\( x^m \\dot{x} (1, x)^n \\) is reduced to that of \\( x^m \\dot{x} (1, x) \\) which we have already found, and in like manner that the determination of the fluent of \\( x^m \\dot{x} (1, x)^n \\) is reduced to that of \\( x^m \\dot{x} (1, x) \\), and so on, from which it appears that the fluent of \\( x^m \\dot{x} (1, x)^n \\) is expressible in finite terms when \\( n \\) is a whole positive number. The formula however will not apply when \\( m = -1 \\), because of the denominator \\( m+1 = -1 + 1 = 0 \\).\n\nBut in this case we have\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{x^n \\dot{x}}{x} (1, x)^n = \\frac{1}{n+1} (1, x)^{n+1} + \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\nIf \\( n \\) be negative or fractional the fluent of \\( x^m \\dot{x} (1, x)^n \\) can only be expressed by an infinite series.\n\n143. As an example of an exponential function, let it be required to find the fluent of \\( ax^n \\dot{x} \\). Here we may put \\( v \\) for \\( ax^n \\), and \\( z \\) for \\( ax^n \\), then we have \\( v = \\frac{ax^n}{n+1} \\), \u00a7101, and \\( z = (1, a) ax^n \\), (\\$56.) therefore, substituting these values of \\( v, z, \\dot{v}, \\dot{z} \\) in the formula \\( \\int z \\dot{v} = vz - \\int v \\dot{z} \\) we get\n\n\\[\n\\int ax^n \\dot{x} = \\frac{ax^{n+1}}{n+1} - \\int \\frac{(1, a) ax^n \\dot{x}}{n+1},\n\\]\n\ntherefore, substituting \\( n = -1 \\) everywhere instead of \\( n \\),\n\n\\[\n\\int ax^n \\dot{x} = \\frac{ax^n}{n} - \\int \\frac{(1, a) ax^n \\dot{x}}{n},\n\\]\n\nhence, bringing \\( \\int ax^n \\dot{x} \\) to stand alone one side of the equation\n\n\\[\n\\int ax^n \\dot{x} = \\frac{ax^n}{1, a} - \\frac{n}{1, a} \\int ax^n \\dot{x} - \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\nIf we suppose \\( n = 1 \\), then, observing that \\( \\int ax^n \\dot{x} = \\frac{ax^n}{1, a} \\) Inverse Method.\n\n(\\$56.), \\( \\int ax^n \\dot{x} = \\frac{ax^n}{1, a} - \\frac{ax^n}{(1, a)^2} + \\text{const.} \\)\n\nIf \\( n = 2 \\), then\n\n\\[\n\\int ax^n \\dot{x} = \\frac{ax^n}{1, a} - \\frac{2}{1, a} \\int ax^n \\dot{x}.\n\\]\n\nIn this expression we substitute the value of \\( \\int ax^n \\dot{x} \\) just found, thus it becomes\n\n\\[\n\\int ax^n \\dot{x} = ax^n \\left\\{ \\frac{x^n}{1, a} - \\frac{2x^n}{(1, a)^2} \\right\\} + \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\nProceeding in this way we may find the fluent when \\( n = 3 \\), or when \\( n = 4 \\), or in general, when \\( n \\) is any integer number whatever, the number of terms in the fluent being in this case always finite; it is not so however when \\( n \\) is either negative or fractional.\n\nOf the Fluents of such Fluxions as contain functions related to a circle.\n\n144. Let us suppose that \\( z \\) is an arch whose fine is \\( x \\), and that it is required to find the fluent of \\( z^n \\dot{x} \\). Put \\( z^n \\dot{x} = v \\), then\n\n\\[\n\\int z^n \\dot{x} = \\int z \\dot{v} = vz - \\int v \\dot{z};\n\\]\n\nbut since \\( v = z^n \\dot{x} \\), we have \\( v = \\frac{zn+1}{n+1} \\), \u00a7101, and since \\( z = \\text{fin. } x \\), we have \\( \\dot{z} = \\text{col. } x = \\sqrt{1-x^2} \\) (\\$59.), and therefore \\( \\dot{z} = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\); thus we have\n\n\\[\n\\int z^n \\dot{x} = \\frac{zn+1}{n+1} - \\frac{1}{n+1} \\int \\frac{zn+1}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}};\n\\]\n\nhence the determination of the proposed fluent is reduced to \\( \\int \\frac{zn+1}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\) which we have already considered in \u00a7133. By the same mode of reasoning we may determine the fluent when \\( x \\) denotes the cosine of the arch \\( z \\).\n\n145. It appears from \u00a759, that \\( n \\) being put to denote any arch of a circle to radius unity, the fluxion of the fine of that arch is \\( n \\cdot \\text{col. } n \\cdot z \\); therefore on the contrary,\n\n\\[\n\\int \\dot{z} \\cdot \\text{col. } n \\cdot z = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\text{fin. } n \\cdot z + \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\nIn like manner from the formulas of \u00a759, and \u00a760, we find\n\n\\[\n\\int \\dot{z} \\cdot \\text{fin. } n \\cdot z = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\text{col. } n \\cdot z + \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\\[ \\int \\dot{z} \\sin n z = -\\frac{1}{n} \\cos n z + \\text{const}. \\]\n\n\\[ \\int \\dot{z} \\cot n z = \\frac{1}{n} \\tan n z + \\text{const}. \\]\n\n\\[ \\int \\dot{z} \\sec n z = \\frac{1}{n} \\cot n z + \\text{const}. \\]\n\n\\[ \\int \\dot{z} \\csc n z = \\frac{1}{n} \\sec n z + \\text{const}. \\]\n\n146.

II. Application of the Inverse Method of Fluxions to the Resolution of Problems.\n\nTo find the Areas of Curves.\n\n152. It has been shown in \u00a761, that if the abscissa of a curve be denoted by \\( x \\), the ordinate by \\( y \\), and the area\narea by \\( s \\), then \\( s = y \\cdot x \\). Therefore the general formula expressing the area of any curve will be\n\n\\[\ns = \\int y \\cdot x \\, dx\n\\]\n\nHence, to find the area of any curve, we must either find from the equation of the curve the value of \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\), or else the value of \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\), and \\( y \\), and either the one or the other of these being substituted into the above formula, and the fluent found by the methods already explained, we shall have a general expression for the curvilinear area as required.\n\n**Ex. 1.** Let it be required to find the area of any curve of the parabolic kind, of which, putting the abscissa \\( AB = x \\), and the ordinate \\( BP = y \\), the equation is\n\n\\[\ny^n = ax^m\n\\]\n\nThen we have \\( y = ax^{m/n} \\), and\n\n\\[\ns = \\int y \\cdot x \\, dx = \\int ax^{m/n} \\cdot x \\, dx\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{na}{m+n} x^{m+n} + C,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) denotes the constant quantity that may be required to complete the fluent. As in the present case, it is required to find the area of the portion of the curve next its vertex, so that when \\( x = 0 \\), therefore also \\( C = 0 \\), and the area is simply\n\n\\[\n\\frac{na}{m+n} x^{m+n}\n\\]\n\nIf it be required to find the area comprehended between two ordinates \\( PB, PB' \\), put \\( AB = d \\), then when \\( x = d \\), therefore the general expression\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{na}{m+n} x^{m+n} + C\n\\]\n\nbecomes in this case\n\n\\[\n\\frac{na}{m+n} d^{m+n} + C,\n\\]\n\nand consequently the area \\( BP \\cdot PB' \\), or \\( s \\), is equal to\n\n\\[\n\\frac{na}{m+n} \\left( x^{m+n} - d^{m+n} \\right)\n\\]\n\nWhen \\( n \\) is an even number, the expression for the area, viz. \\( \\frac{na}{m+n} x^{m+n} \\), may be considered as negative as well as positive, on account of the radical quantity \\( x^{m+n} \\), or \\( \\sqrt{x^{m+n}} \\), which has then a twofold value, it may therefore have the sign \\( \\pm \\) prefixed to it; but in this case the same abscissa \\( AB \\) belongs to two branches of the curve \\( AP \\) and \\( AP' \\) as in fig. 19. N\u00b0 1, therefore the two values of the expression \\( \\frac{na}{m+n} x^{m+n} \\) may be considered as indicating the two areas \\( \\Delta PB, \\Delta PB' \\).\n\nOn each side of the axis, corresponding the one to the positive, and the other to the negative ordinates.\n\nWhen the exponents \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are both odd numbers,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m+n}{m+n}\n\\]\n\nthe quantity \\( x^{m+n} \\) has only one sign and remains always positive whatever be the sign of \\( x \\), but in this case one of the two branches of the curve has its abscissas and its ordinates negative at the same time (as in fig. 19. N\u00b0 2.) it follows therefore that the areas corresponding to the negative abscissas and ordinates ought to be regarded as positive.\n\nIf \\( n \\) alone is odd, then the quantity \\( x^{m+n} \\) becomes negative at the same time as \\( x \\), but in this case the two branches of the curve are on the same side of the line in which the abscissas are taken (as in fig. 19. N\u00b0 3.) and the ordinates remain always positive.\n\nUpon the whole it may be concluded, that the area of a curve is positive when the abscissas and the ordinates have the same sign, and negative when they have contrary signs.\n\nIf we suppose \\( m = 1 \\), and \\( n = 2 \\), then the curve is the common parabola, the area of which from the general formula is found to be\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} a^{1/2} x^{3/2} = \\frac{2}{3} xy;\n\\]\n\nhence it appears that the parabola is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of its circumscribing parallelogram.\n\n**Ex. 2.** Suppose the curve to be a circle.

If this number be substituted instead of \\( x \\), and a few terms of the series computed, we shall find the area \\( ABP = 0.452931 \\); to this add the triangle \\( CRB = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 0.2165063 \\), and we have the sector \\( ACP = 0.2617994 \\), which number when multiplied by 3 gives \\( 7833882 \\) for the area of the quadrant. This number also expresses the area of a circle of which the diameter is 1.\n\n**Ex. 3.** Suppose the curve to be an ellipse.

Hence it appears that the area of any segment of an ellipse is to the area of the corresponding segment of its circumscribing circle as the lesser axis of the ellipse is to the greater; therefore the whole ellipse must be to the whole circle in the same ratio.\n\nEx. 4. Let the curve be a hyperbola, of which \\( C \\) is the centre. Put the semi-transverse axis \\( CA = a \\), the semiconjugate axis \\( CB = x \\), \\( BP = y \\), the area \\( APB = s \\).

Suppose the curve to be an equilateral hyperbola, that is a hyperbola whose axes are equal, and that it is required to find the curvilinear area \\( DCBP \\) comprehended between \\( DC \\), a perpendicular from \\( D \\) (a given point in the curve) to one of the asymptotes, and \\( PB \\), a perpendicular from any other point in the curve to the same asymptote.\n\nLet \\( A \\) be the centre, put \\( AC = a \\), \\( CD = b \\), \\( AB = x \\), \\( BP = y \\), the area \\( DCBP = s \\). From the property of the asymptotes we have \\( xy = ab \\), and therefore \\( y = \\frac{ab}{x} \\), hence (\\$ 103.)\n\n\\[ s = \\int y \\dot{x} = \\int \\frac{ab}{x} \\dot{x} = abl. x + c. \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( c \\), let us suppose \\( x = a \\), then \\( s = 0 \\) and the general formula becomes in this case\n\n\\[ 0 = abl. a + c, \\]\n\nand hence \\( c = -abl. a \\),\n\ntherefore\n\n\\[ s = abl. x - abl. a = abl. \\frac{x}{a}. \\]\n\nIf we suppose \\( a = b = 1 \\), then \\( s = 1 \\cdot x \\), from which it appears that in this case the hyperbolic area \\( DCBP \\) represents the Napierian logarithm of the number \\( x \\); it was from the consideration of this property that the logarithms originally invented by Napier were called hyperbolic logarithms.\n\nBut the logarithms of any other system may also be represented by areas of the same hyperbola; for this purpose it is only necessary to determine the magnitudes of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), so that \\( \\frac{b}{a} = M \\), where \\( M \\) denotes the modulus of the system, thus we shall have \\( ab = a^2 M \\), and \\( s = a^2 M l. \\frac{x}{a} \\), or, putting \\( a = 1 \\), \\( s = M l. x \\), an expression for the logarithm of \\( x \\) according to any system whatever of which the modulus is \\( M \\) (\\( \\text{ALGEBRA} \\), \u00a7 287.).\n\nEx. 6. Let the curve be the cycloid of which \\( AE \\) is the axis and \\( A \\) the vertex, let a semicircle be described on \\( AE \\) as a diameter, draw \\( AG \\) perpendicular to the axis, and from any point in the curve draw \\( PB \\) perpendicular to \\( AG \\) and \\( PD \\) perpendicular to \\( AE \\), meeting the circle in \\( Q \\) and draw \\( QC \\) to \\( C \\) the centre of the circle. Put \\( AC = a \\), \\( AB = x \\), \\( BP = y \\), the area \\( APB = s \\), and put \\( v \\) for the angle \\( ACQ \\), that is for the arch of a circle which measures \\( ACQ \\), the radius of\nof that circle being unity, then \\( AD = a (1 - \\text{cof. } v) \\), \\( DQ = a \\sin v \\), and arch \\( AQ = a v \\), and since from the nature of the curve, \\( PD = \\text{arch } AQ + DQ \\), therefore \\( PD = a v + a \\sin v = a (v + \\sin v) \\); hence\n\n\\[\nx = a (v + \\sin v), \\quad \\dot{x} = a \\dot{v} (1 + \\text{cof. } v), \\quad (\\text{\u00a7 59})\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = a (1 - \\text{cof. } v)\n\\]\n\n\\[\ns = \\int x \\dot{y} = \\int a^2 \\dot{v} (1 - \\text{cof. } v)^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= a^2 \\int \\sin^2 v = \\frac{a^2}{2} \\sin^2 v = \\frac{a^2}{2} \\sin v \\cos v \\quad (\\text{\u00a7 148})\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} AC \\times \\text{arch } AQ = \\frac{1}{2} CD \\times DQ;\n\\]\n\nand here no constant quantity is wanted to complete the fluent; because upon the supposition that \\( AQ = 0 \\) both sides of the equation vanish as they ought to do; now it is obvious that \\( \\frac{1}{2} AC \\times AQ = \\text{area of sector } ACQ \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{2} CD \\times DQ = \\text{area of triangle } DCQ \\), therefore\n\n\\( s = \\text{area of circ. seg. } ADQ \\).\n\nLet \\( AG \\) be the greatest value of \\( x \\); complete the parallelogram \\( AGFE \\), then from the general expression for the cycloidal area, it follows that the whole cycloidal space \\( APFG \\) is equal to the semicircle \\( AQE \\); but from the nature of the curve, \\( EF \\) is equal to \\( AQE \\), half the circumference, therefore the rectangle \\( EG \\) is equal to four times the semicircle \\( AQE \\); from these equals take away the external cycloidal space \\( AGF \\), and the semicircle \\( AQE \\), which have been shown to be equal, and the remainders, viz. the internal cycloidal space \\( APFE \\), and three times the semicircle \\( AQE \\) are equal to each other.\n\n153. In some cases it is more convenient to refer a curve line to a fixed point than to an axis. Thus instead of expressing the nature of the circle by the equation \\( y^2 = a x - x^2 \\), where \\( y \\) denotes a perpendicular from any point of the curve upon \\( a \\) the diameter, and \\( x \\) the distance of that perpendicular from one end of the diameter, we may otherwise express it by the equation \\( z = v \\), where \\( z \\) denotes a variable arch of the circle reckoned from one end of its diameter, \\( r \\) its radius, and \\( v \\) the angle contained by a line drawn from the centre of the circle through the extremity of \\( z \\), which angle is measured by an arch of a circle having its radius unity.\n\nThe nature of the different conic sections may be defined in the same manner. Let \\( P \\) be any point in a conic section, of which \\( F \\) is one focus, and \\( FA \\) a part of the axis; let \\( DC \\) the directrix of the section meet \\( FA \\) in \\( C \\), join \\( PF \\), and draw \\( PB \\) perpendicular to the axis, and \\( PD \\) to the directrix; then from the nature of the curve (Conic Sections) \\( PF \\) has a given ratio to \\( PD \\), that is to \\( FC - FB \\); put \\( FC = a \\), \\( FP = r \\), the angle \\( PFC = v \\), and suppose \\( PF : PD :: n : 1 \\), then \\( PF = n \\cdot PD = n \\cdot FC - n \\cdot FB \\), hence, observing that \\( FB = FP \\times \\text{cof. } v \\), we get \\( r = a n - nr \\text{cof. } v \\), and \\( r = \\frac{an}{1 + n \\text{cof. } v} \\)","sp":330,"ep":384},{"h":"OINTMENTS","t":"Ointments are employed in farriery, merely as an application to sores, or in some cases of eruptions of the skin. They cannot be employed as in the human body, to introduce remedies into the system; as on account of the hair that covers the body of quadrupeds,\nPoultices.\n\nPoultices are frequently employed, either for the purpose of maintaining a long-continued heat and moisture about a part in which we are desirous to produce suppuration, or for correcting the unpleasant smell that sometimes arises from foul ill-conditioned ulcers; or lastly, they are applied to check inflammation. In the first case they are always applied warm, and should be renewed repeatedly, till the proper effect is produced; as if old poultices are suffered to remain long on a suppurating part, they tend to check the suppuration instead of afflicting it. In the two latter cases poultices are usually applied cold.\n\nPoultices should always be composed of such substances, as admit of being reduced to a soft mass, either by boiling or pounding, as otherwise they would fret and irritate the parts to which they are applied. This must be particularly attended to in such poultices as are laid over large open ulcers, or any part that is highly sensible.\n\nFomentations.\n\nThese are intended to relax and soften the parts to which they are applied, and in this circumstance they nearly resemble the first kind of poultices, only that fomentations are always in a liquid form, being composed of some infusion or decoction of herbs. The mode of applying a fomentation is, by wetting a large flannel cloth in the warm liquor, wringing it slightly, and then applying it as warm as can easily be borne over the part to be fomented.\n\nIn the following list of the articles of the veterinary materia medica, we shall call the substances by those names by which they are usually known to the common people; but we shall add by way of synonyms the scientific names, as derived from the modern systems of natural history and chemistry. In fixing the doses of each article, we shall, unless particularly mentioned to the contrary, only specify the dose proper for horses and cattle; but it would be proper for the reader to keep in remembrance, that the dose for a sheep or a dog will be about one-half or one-third of that for a horse or cow.\n\nIn classing the remedies we shall adapt the arrangement given in a late compendium of the materia medica. Most writers on the materia medica of horses, have arranged their articles in alphabetical order. Mr White has done this, in his excellent veterinary materia medica and pharmacopeia. Such an arrangement does very well, if intended to answer the purpose of a dictionary; but for practice, it is better to have the articles classified according to the sensible effects which they appear to produce in the system; as in this way the practitioner has before him all those remedies that are of the same nature, and may select from among them such as he thinks will best suit the particular case that he has in hand.\n\nIt may be necessary to observe, that the weight intended in this part is troy weight divided according to the apothecaries, and the measure English wine measure.\n\nEmetics.\n\nIt will have appeared from our description of the stomach of the horse, that this animal is in general incapable of vomiting. Emetics, therefore, as calculated for him, form no part of the veterinary materia medica. We do not know that emetics are given either to sheep or cattle, but to dogs they may be often given with advantage. A few substances, however, will answer this purpose, as in general a little gruel, or a little mustard mixed with warm water, will be sufficient to vomit a dog. The following substances may be ranked in this class for dogs.\n\na. Antimony. Sulphuret of Antimony.\n   Emetic Tartar. Tartrate of Antimony and Potash.\n   Dose from two to four grains.\n\nb. Antimonial Powder. Oxide of Antimony with Phosphate of Lime. James's Powder.\n   Said to have been given with success in the distemper.\n   Dose from eight to ten grains, repeated every three or four hours, according to the evacuation produced.\n\nc. Mercury.\n   Turpith Mineral. Yellow Sulphate of Mercury.\n   Used also for the distemper, and in cases of recent poisoning.\n   Dose about half a drachm. Also recommended in canine madness.\n\nReceipt.\n\n1. Take of turpith mineral, five grains;\n   And emetic tartar, one grain.\n   Give in a little milk after bleeding.\n\n2.

Take afaetida, half an ounce;\n   Powdered ginger, a drachm and a half;\n   Prepared ammonia, half a drachm;\n   Honey, &c. enough to make a ball.\n\n3. SUDORIFICS.\n\nThese are such medicines as are intended, either to keep up or bring back the infensible perspiration, or to excite profuse sweating. They are also called diaphoretics. See Materia Medica.\n\nFew medicines are employed in farriery with a view to excite sweat. In the dog, it is well-known that this effect can scarcely be produced by any means; and in the horse it is found extremely difficult to produce any sensible sudorific effect by means of medicine. This may indeed be excited by violent exercise and warm clothing; but these are ill suited to the cases in which sweating would be most desirable. The infensible perspiration may, however, be gently encouraged by some powerful sweating medicines; and in cattle these may not unfrequently be given with advantage.\n\na.

Take of unwashed calx or oxide of antimony, two drachms;\n    Prepared ammonia, ginger, of each a drachm;\n    Opium, half a drachm;\n    Powdered aniseeds, half an ounce;\n    Molasses, enough to make a ball.\n\n4. DIURETICS.\n\nThese are remedies that are intended to produce a diuretic more than ordinary discharge of urine. See Materia Medica.\n\nDiuretics.\nDiuretics are frequently given to horses, not only in cases of dropical swellings, especially of the legs, but in gout, and in many eruptive diseases; in running ulcers, cracks, or ulcers about the heels; in baldness of different parts of the body; and in some cases where there appears to be a difficulty in flaring.\n\nThey are usually given in the form of balls, but some of them by way of powder mixed with the food. Before exhibiting diuretics, bleeding is sometimes requisite. These cases will be stated in their proper place. It is also proper, during the use of diuretics, that the animal should take regular exercise; and occasional drink should be given, to promote their operation. The use of them should not be continued too long, as they are found to produce considerable weakness.\n\na. Balsam of Copaiva. See Expectorants.\nThis medicine, when given as directed under expectorants, frequently acts as a diuretic.\n\nb. Camphor. See Sudorifics.\nDose about two drachms, mixed with nitre in a ball. In spasmodic difficulty of flaring.\n\nc. Nitre. Nitrate of Potash.\nDose about one ounce, in the form of powder, ball, or drench. In fevers and strangury.\n\nd. Potash. Subcarbonate of Potash, or Vegetable Alkali.\nDose a drachm or two.\n\ne. Rosin.\nDose from two to four drachms repeated occasionally, in the form of powder with the food.\nRosin is a good diuretic in cases of swollen legs and greasy heels, but is seldom given, except to cart-horses.\n\nf. Soap. Castile Soap.\nDose from two to six drachms, in composition.\n\ng. Tobacco. Nicotiana tabacum. Lin.\nSometimes given by grooms for fining a horse's coat.\n\nh. Turpentine.\na. Common turpentine.\nb. Venice turpentine. Dose from half an ounce to an ounce; in the form of emulsion.\n\ni. Oil or Spirit of Turpentine.\nDose from one ounce to two.\n\nReceipts for Diuretics.\n\n12. Take of Castile soap, powdered rosin, of each three drachms;\nNitre, half an ounce;\nOil of juniper, a drachm.\nFirst beat the soap and oil of juniper together, and then add the other ingredients, to make a ball.\n\n13. Take of nitre in powder, half an ounce;\nCamphor, oil of juniper, of each one drachm;\nCastile soap, three drachms.\nRub the camphor and oil together, then add the soap and nitre, and as much flour as is sufficient to make it into a ball.\n\nTake of rosin and nitre, each half an ounce.\nMix into a powder, to be taken with the food.\n\n5. Purges.\nThese medicines are well known. They are generally considered of two kinds; laxatives, or such as gently move the bowels, and are intended merely to empty them of excrement; and purges, or such as, besides this effect, are intended to stimulate the exhalent vessels of the intestines, and produce a considerable discharge of liquid stools. (See Materia Medica.) As either order may in general be given so as to produce either of these effects, according to the quantity in which it is administered, we shall consider them together.\n\nPurgative medicines are given with considerable advantage to all the domestic animals, in many cases of disease, which will be pointed out hereafter. They are very commonly, however, given to horses, by grooms and ordinary farriers, by way of alternative or preventive of disease; or in order, as they think, the better to prepare them for some unusual exertion. The reason given for this practice is, that the horse is foul in the body, or full of humours, and the purgatives are given to expel this morbid accumulation of humours.\n\n\"This sort of evacuation (says Dr. Bracken, who is improperly one of the first that pointed out the absurdity of this minute practice), seems very much to quadrature with the outward fumes, and makes the ignorant part of mankind, horses whose heads are fuller of humours than their horses, imagine that purging medicines carry off the offending matter in most disorders; never considering the general rule, which ought still to be kept in mind, viz. that in proportion to any one evacuation being heightened or increased, most or all of the other natural evacuations are proportionally diminished.\n\nIt must be remembered that the intestines of the horse are exceedingly long, and the large intestines are so constructed as in many cases to retain the food or excrement for a very considerable time. Purgative medicines given to a horse are often retained for 24 or 36 hours; and if these have been of an irritating quality, it is evident that the unnecessary exhibition of them may often produce considerable mischief. Mr. Blaine says, that when horses die after the exhibition of strong purges, which according to him is not unfrequently the case, he has always found the large intestines more or less inflamed.\n\nIt is found that after giving a horse a strong purge, he is often incapable of returning to his usual work for many days; it is even said for a month. Hence it will easily appear how absurd is the practice of those who physic their horses without necessity. Mr. John Lawrence is, however, still an advocate for purging horses now and then, and is of opinion that the mischief done by purges is to be attributed to the coarseness of the medicine, rather than to its purging effect. He declares, that after 30 years experience, he has never known purging do harm, if the aloes employed was of the finer sort.\n\nVeterinary practitioners differ with respect to the time of administering a purge. Mr. Blaine recommends it to be given in the morning, when the horse is to be allowed to fast from 9 or 10 o'clock to 12 or 1. Then a lock or two of hay, or about two handfuls, is to be given him, and after this he is to have the ball, with a horn...\nhorn full of warm ale, or water-gruel, immediately after it. He is then to fast for another hour, when he is to be allowed the moderate use of hay. He should have all his drink a little warm; should be walked about gently during the remainder of the day, and should have a warm bath at night. Next day he is to be again moderately exercised at intervals, till the purge begins to operate; but if the weather is severe, he must be covered with body clothes, and care must be taken not to have the stable too warm when he returns. Mr Clark recommends a bath of bran to be given about an hour before the bath, and says that in this way he has always found the medicine to operate in a gentle and easy manner.\n\nIt is a common practice with many people to ride their horses very hard before giving them a purging medicine, with the view, as they term it, to stir up the humours, which being thus set afloat, will more easily be carried off by the purge. To say no more with respect to the absurdity of the doctrine, we may remark that the practice itself is highly dangerous, as a purge administered after such violent exercise, will seldom fail to produce inflammation in the bowels, fevers, or some other disorder, which, though it may not at the time prove fatal, may lay the foundation of blindness, incurable lameness, or some other disorder that may render the horse useless. Violent exercise, after administering a purge, is equally to be avoided, as it may produce sweating, and thus counteract the purgative effect; or, what is as bad, it will tend to increase the weakness that seldom fails to be brought on by purging.\n\nWe have been the more particular in our observations on purging horses, as it is a matter of considerable consequence, and as the effect of indiscriminate purging in this animal is little understood.\n\n**a.

Similar instances are related both by sacred and profane historians.\n\nAlmost the whole tribe of inflammations, even the gout (according to Van Swieten), are found to affect the domestic animals, are produced by the same causes,\n\n(A) It may be thought by some, that we have gone too far in accusing the farriers and grooms, &c. of having a fellow-feeling; but, when it is known, that \"a part of every shilling paid to common farriers, is in some shape returned to the groom, as a fee or perquisite;\" that \"the servant receives at least five per cent. from the farrier on every bill paid by his master;\" and that \"if a horse dies under the care of a farrier, he generally becomes the property of the groom;\" (See Veterinary Transactions, No. 1. Introduction); it will be allowed that there is some ground for the surmise.\nDomestic animals are subject to eruptive diseases, both chronic, and such as are attended with fever; and both are very similar to those by which man is affected. It is pretty certain that the smallpox sometimes rages among sheep, as we shall see hereafter; and a complaint very like the measles often attacks swine. Some of them are transferable to man; and to this transference in the case of the cowpox, a blessing which will render immortal the name of Jenner, we owe the probable annihilation of one of the most dreadful pests that ever afflicted the human race.\n\nScrofula and consumption attack monkeys. Apoplexy, epilepsy, and many others of what are called nervous diseases, indigestion, and even mental derangement, are not uncommon among domestic animals; spasmodic affections are very frequent among them, and it is said, that for one case of tetanus or locked jaw among the human species in these climates, there are ten or twenty among horses.\n\nThe analogy might be pursued much farther; but what has been stated is sufficient to show the advantages that medical men may derive from the study of veterinary medicine. Many obscure and dangerous diseases may thus in time be illustrated or mitigated; and the effect of doubtful remedies may be ascertained by experiments on the inferior animals. For, though there are a few instances of different effects following the exhibition of the same medicines in man and animals; yet, on the whole, the analogy is nearly as complete with respect to remedies as diseases (B).\n\nIt will appear, from what has been said, that the reasoning, and much of the treatment, in the diseases of animals must be nearly the same as in man, and, of course, that the veterinary practitioner will gain much by acquiring a knowledge of human medicine. Were the practitioners in farriery generally instructed in the principles of medicine, little more would be required, in a treatise on farriery, than to point out the difference in the structure and functions of domestic animals, to describe the diseases peculiar to them, and to mark the varieties that it is necessary to observe in the treatment of disease and the administration of remedies. But, as many of these gentlemen have not the opportunity of attending medical lectures, and most of them have not received an education that would enable them to understand the language in which medical writings are usually composed; it becomes necessary in a treatise of this kind to accommodate the language to the taste and capacity of general readers, and to introduce much that will be found in other articles on subjects connected with medicine. To prevent repetition, as much as possible, and to avoid swelling this article to a greater length than is necessary, we shall, however, where the similarity of the subject will admit of it, occasionally refer to some of the medical articles in this dictionary.\n\nThe successful practice of farriery, like that of medicine in general, requires that the practitioner should possess a considerable share of knowledge. It is not sufficient to have been long in the habit of managing the veterinary horses and cattle; this indeed, to a person of a strong mind, and attentive observation, will furnish a considerable number of facts, with respect to the symptoms and progress of the diseases to which domestic animals are subject. But, to mark the minute differences between such as resemble each other, to investigate their causes, and to contrive a rational mode of treatment, requires a much greater share of abilities, and much more extensive information, than we can expect to find among grooms and shepherds, or falls to the lot of most of those, who call themselves farriers and cattle-doctors.\n\nIt must be obvious to every thinking mind, that no Anatomy practice either in medicine or farriery can be rational, but such as is founded on a comprehensive knowledge of the structure and functions of those animals, the treatment of whose diseases is the object of that practice. The first thing, therefore, necessary to the veterinary practitioner is, to acquire some idea of the anatomical structure of the domestic animals. We have already, in the second part of the article Anatomy, given a general account of the structure of quadrupeds; and in exemplifying this, in the chapter on the anatomy of a dog, we pointed out the most striking peculiarities that are to be found in this animal; as we have done with respect to ruminating animals, viz. the cow and sheep, in the succeeding chapter of that part. To that article we must refer our readers for the anatomical part of our subject, as far as relates to the ox, the sheep, and the dog. It will naturally be expected, that a description of the structure of the horse should be given in this article; but this description must, in general, be concise, as the nature of our plan prevents us from enlarging on the subject, excepting in those parts where a pretty minute knowledge appears to be necessary.\n\nThose who wish to study the anatomy of the horse minutely, may consult Vitet's Medicine Veterinaire, tom. i.; Blaine's Outlines, and Stubb's elegant work on the anatomy of the horse.\n\nThe practitioner should take every opportunity of inspecting the bodies of those animals that die of diseases, which are very important, or which are not very well understood. Morbid affections often throw considerable light on the nature and treatment of diseases; and it fortunately happens, that with respect to domestic animals, these affections are very easy, and are not obstructed by those absurd prejudices, which, especially in this country, are opposed to the diffusion of human bodies. In treating of the diseases of domestic animals, in\n\n(B) One of the most remarkable cases of anomaly in the effect of remedies is that of arsenic, which, in the quantity of a few grains will prove a deadly poison to man and most animals, but may be given with impunity to horses to the amount of two drams or more. The story of the different effects of antimony, on hogs and monkeys, is well known. See Antimony. As to the example of white vitriol, (fulphate of zinc), which proves emetic in the human subject, but produces no such effect in the horse; it is owing to the different structure of the stomach in this animal, by which he is incapable of vomiting. Colocynthis, or bitter apple, is well known to be a most violent purgative to man, but in the horse it has produced no effect, in the enormous dose of four ounces.\na future part of this article, we shall give a concise view of the appearances on disease, as far as they have been ascertained, whenever they tend to illustrate the nature, causes, or treatment of the disease under consideration.\n\nThe study of the functions of domestic animals ought to go hand in hand with that of their structure; and the student will find it of considerable advantage, to compare the functions of these animals with those of man. This comparative view will be given in some future article. In the present treatise, we can only speak of the functions of domestic animals, as far as it is necessary to illustrate the nature or the treatment of their diseases.\n\nThe natural history of these animals ought to form a part of the studies of the veterinary practitioner. It is a subject that is not only highly curious and interesting, but extremely useful. We find, that these animals, in their native fields, enjoy a state of health and vigour, which is interrupted only by those accidents to which a life of liberty and wildness may expose them. It is only when they are received under the protection of man, that they become subject to disease. It is therefore an interesting inquiry, to examine into their native habits; as, in our endeavours to preserve their health, we should, as nearly as is compatible with convenience and economy, imitate the habits that are found to prevail among these animals in a state of nature. It is the province of the naturalist to describe the external conformation of these animals, and the advantages, and defects dependant on it, that fit or disqualify them for the various purposes, for which they are destined under the service of man; it is his business to describe the methods of breeding these animals in a state of nature, and how far this may be improved for the purposes of domestication, and to detail the method of training and managing them. Many of these circumstances are treated of by some of the writers on the veterinary art, in a complete system of which they ought not properly to be omitted. We shall, however, not treat of them in this article, as, according to the plan of our work, they more properly fall to be considered under the article MAMMALIA, in which will be given the natural history of all quadrupeds.\n\nChemistry must form a necessary part of the studies of every man who engages in the practice of medicine, whether human or veterinary, as, without a knowledge of its principles, neither the functions of the animal economy, the intimate structure of its component parts, nor the action of many remedies, can be properly understood. In the article CHEMISTRY, we have prepared abundant matter for the reader to make himself acquainted with the elements of that admirable science.\n\nThe practitioner, whether of human or veterinary medicine, who is a proficient in anatomy, wants but a little manual dexterity, and some practical experience, to make him a tolerable surgeon. The operations to be performed on brutes are few, and these are in general very clumsily executed. Humanity, however, as well as prudence, will readily point out to the farrier the necessity of learning the best methods of performing these operations with dexterity and despatch, so as to give the least pain to the unfortunate animals that are placed under his care. We shall describe the usual operations immediately after treating of the anatomy of the horse.\n\nIt is of considerable consequence, that the person who undertakes the management of domestic animals, should make himself acquainted with those circumstances which experience has shewn to be most favourable to the preservation of their health, and the prevention of their diseases. This subject forms what may be called veterinary hygeiology; and will be considered at some length in the fourth part of this article.\n\nBefore the practitioner can attempt to remove or alleviate the diseases to which domestic animals are subjected, he must acquire a competent knowledge of the remedies employed for that purpose, their nature, uses, and doses, as adapted to the different animals, in various situations, and various diseases; with the methods of preparing and compounding them into the several forms that are usually employed; and with the best means of administering them. This comprehends what is called the veterinary materia medica, and will form the subject of our fifth part.\n\nWith this previous knowledge, the veterinary practitioner is prepared to enter on the consideration of the diseases, which will be treated of in the sixth part of our article. He must be particularly attentive to the symptoms of each disease, as, on an accurate knowledge of these, will depend the means of distinguishing these complaints, which upon a superficial view bear considerable resemblance to each other, but which require a very different, and perhaps opposite mode of treatment. He must attend to the greater or less violence of these symptoms, to the nature of the part which they attack, and to the greater or less rapidity of their progress; as these circumstances must considerably influence the judgment he is to form of the danger, and probable termination, of the disease. He must, as far as possible, investigate the causes, that appear to have produced the disease in question, or which seem to aggravate or keep up the morbid symptoms; as on the removal or mitigation of these causes, must depend the only rational and scientific method of cure. Lastly, he must make himself acquainted with the treatment that experience has found most successful in the cure of each particular disease, as well as with that which has been found to be attended with little or no advantage.\n\nAs the proper means of attaining the best information is of the greatest importance, we shall here give Mr Blaine's instructions on this point.\n\n\"The mode in which any art is attained, must be in a great measure directed by the future views of the learners. It appears to me that there are three distinct classes of persons, who are likely to study this branch of useful knowledge. The first are persons of enlarged minds, and extended fortunes. The second are surgeons, whose situation in country villages may render their services in this art highly useful, upon occasions when no farrier is at hand, or, in the end, in cases in which farriers of the common class are unable to judge. The third are farriers themselves, or persons intending to profess veterinary medicine.\n\n\"Gentlemen and amateurs, who wish to accumulate information on this curious and interesting subject, within the reach of the veterinary college, will find their account in attending a course of lectures there; if not,\nnot, they should apply themselves to the study of the more general parts of the body, both of the human and animal; the latter, I hope, they may attain by the following sheets. They may direct the collar maker, huntsman, or tanner, to cut up their dead horses in their presence. They may study physiology in a pleasant and interesting manner, from the ingenious work on this subject by Mr Saumarez. The lighter parts of the veterinary art may be acquired with pleasure, from the elegant publication of Mr Richard Lawrence of Birmingham, and a course of chemistry will amply reward them for their pains in acquiring it.\n\n\"A good surgeon has travelled three-fourths of the road towards making a good veterinarian, but he must diligently travel the remainder to arrive at excellence. He must by no means sit down contented with the analogy between the human and brute; which, if he does, will lead him into very great error; for though this analogy is in most cases very striking, yet there are others in which the similarity fails, and he is left to act upon other principles. Hence those diseases that are conquered or mitigated by vomiting in the human; in the horse he must pursue another mode of treatment. In acute diseases removed by purging in the human, his attempts on the horse would probably fail; as before the effects were produced, the animal might be past relief. It must be remembered that the operations of medicines are very different in the one, and the other. It is not sufficient that a surgeon has an intimate acquaintance with the human frame; he must be equally conversant with the animal he treats, or he will treat in vain; particularly those diseases originating in a peculiarity of form from the human, as all the diseases of the feet. He should make himself particularly conversant with the specific diseases of the horse, which bear no analogy to anything in the human body; as farcy, glanders, strangles, greale, &c. From the great strength of the arterial system, he must ever be aware how prone the diseases of the horse are to a rapid termination, and hence that his treatment must be decisive and energetic; therefore, in all cases, he must be very attentive to diagnostics. But what will much embarrass a surgeon in practising the veterinary art, will be a want of knowledge of the general usages, nomenclature, and idioms, if I may so express it, among grooms and farriers; without an acquaintance with which, these people at once detect and despise the practitioner. It should be the business therefore of the surgeon, with his other acquisitions, to learn their manners, and to make himself acquainted with their terms. The third class of persons, either farriers already practising, or persons intending to practise, will easily gain that. When it is in their power, I would advise their taking the advantage of the veterinary college; but when they cannot, I would recommend the prosecution of their studies in a regular manner. Begin by first reading some general description of the human body, such as Symond's Anatomy, or the anatomical part of the present work, carefully; let them pay attention to the functions and uses of the parts, particularly where the same uses are brought about by a variation in structure; this enlarges the mind, and prepares it to receive the benefits of dissection, which should now be proceeded to. Any small animal may be first dissected, to enable the learner to use his instruments properly. He may then proceed to dissect the horse with some authorities by him, which will assist him at first to make out parts, but too scrupulous an attention to numerous descriptions will only bewilder. The necessary instructions for dissection, and the preservation of parts, may be gained, by a recourse to Poole's Anatomical Instructor, which is professedly written to instruct the pupil in these particulars. When he is well acquainted with the appearance of the animal in health, he should take every opportunity of examining diseased appearances, which are seldom wanting at the tan-yard or the kennel. He should now make himself acquainted more intimately with physiology, for which purpose he may read Haller's works; there is at present a translation of Cuvier's Treatise on Comparative Anatomy, which he may likewise avail himself of. When he has become acquainted with pathology, as at present received, he may peruse the older authors on farriery; to this should succeed a knowledge in chemistry, preceded by an acquaintance with the materia medica; the proper works for which he may see by a reference to that article, and nothing will now be wanting, but experience and practice to perfect him.\"\n\nSince the establishment of a veterinary school in Britain, little is wanting to promote the progress and improvement of the veterinary art, as far as relates to the knowledge of farriery. But the art, with respect to the medical treatment of other animals, is still in the most deplorable state of imperfection. Proposals have been made for improving cattle medicine; and among these, we think the following of Mr John Lawrence, entitled to attention; though, probably the proposer's list of works may be much improved and enlarged, by referring to the account of authors which will be immediately given.\n\nMr Lawrence's proposal is simply, \"that the affair of Mr Lawrence providing the country with regular-bred surgeons, for once's proposal, the practice of cattle medicine, be immediately undertaken by the agricultural societies; at least, that the experiment be made by some of the most considerable, each society engaging a gentleman of that description, at a sufficient and respectable annual stipend. The contract may run in such form, that should the surgeon's annual emolument from practice come short of the stipulated sum, the deficiency should annually be made up by his patrons the society. No person to be engaged on any pretence, but who shall have received the usual education of a surgeon, and have attended the hospitals the usual length of time. A selection of Veterinary text-books to be made, and the books purchased for the use of the surgeon, but to remain the property of the society. This may consist of Gibbon's last edition, two vols. Bracken, Bartlett, Osmer, Layard, with our late writers; and Lafoile and Bourgelat from the French, with whatever may have been published since their time, by authority of the French veterinary schools. All the members of the society and their connections, as far as their influence may extend, to entrust the care of their diseased animals to the surgeon appointed, at a fair and liberal charge for his attendance and medicines. The surgeon to keep a regular history of all the cases which shall come under his inspection, including the presumed causes and symptoms of the disease, with the probable methods of prevention, his mode of treatment, a particular detail of the medicines prescribed, their operation, with every relative and useful remark which may occur.\"\nPART I. HISTORY.\n\nTHE early history of farriery, as of every other art and science, is involved in great obscurity. We shall not attempt to penetrate the cloud that hangs over the ancient state of the art, or to supply the want of facts, by conjectures, which, however rational, can lead to no certain or useful conclusions.\n\nThere seems no doubt that in the time of Hippocrates, and probably long before, the medical practitioner exercised his office in favour of the domestic animals, as well as of man; and Galen seems to have been well skilled in the knowledge and treatment of some of the diseases of animals.\n\nPerhaps the earliest authentic writings on the subject of the veterinary art, now extant, are to be found in the works of Columella, the celebrated Roman author on husbandry, who, in his work *De Re Rustica*, has given many sensible directions for the management of horses and cattle. Columella lived about the second century, under the reign of the Roman emperor Tiberius, or, as some say, of Claudius Caesar.\n\nIt is understood that Celsus, the elegant imitator of Hippocrates, who lived some time before Columella, wrote much on the diseases of animals; but none of his writings on this subject have survived the general wreck of science and literature that accompanied the fall of the Roman empire.\n\nWe have no certain accounts of any author who wrote expressly on this subject earlier than Vegetius, who flourished, as is supposed, sometime in the fourth century, and probably during the reign of the emperor Valentinian the third. The work of Vegetius, *De Arte Veterinaria*, is still considered as extremely valuable, as it has handed down to us the only certain account of the opinions and practice of the early practitioners in this art. The body of the work appears to have been compiled from the most celebrated Greek writers on the subject. It is divided into four books; the prefaces or introductory chapters to which are written in very elegant language.\n\nAn edition of Vegetius was published at Basil, in 1574; and the work has been translated into several modern languages. Such of our readers as wish for a particular account of the contents of Vegetius's treatise, will find a copious analysis of it, in the third volume of M. Vitet's *Medicine Veterinaire*.\n\nA collection of fragments of ancient writers on the veterinary art, was made by Ruellius, physician to Francis I., king of France. It was first published in Latin, in the year 1530; and afterwards, in 1637, the original Greek was published. The writers who contributed to this collection were chiefly Abysetus, Fumelius, Hierocles, Patagonius, and Theonetus. Some part of this collection is tolerably good; but, on the whole, it appears to be a strange jumble of good, bad, and indifferent, collected without judgment, and arranged without taste.\n\nIt is said that Xenophon, who lived three or four hundred years before the Christian era, wrote a small treatise in twelve chapters, on the training, management, and external figure of horses; but, as he says little or nothing with respect to their diseases, he cannot properly be ranked among the writers on veterinary medicine.\n\nA blank of more than a thousand years now occurs dark ages in the history of farriery. During this long period of darkness, ignorance, and barbarity, the veterinary art, like most others, rather went back than advanced. During some part of this gloom, however, the art of shoeing horses with iron appears to have been invented; an art which seems to have contributed not a little to throw the management of this noble animal into the hands of a set of errant blockheads, who were now first called farriers. We cannot here enter on a discussion of the medical pretensions of these guardians of the health of horses. They have been amply commented on, by some of the best writers on the subject of farriery, as Gibbon, Bracken, Lafoffe, and particularly Mr John Lawrence, to whose useful and humane treatise on horses we refer our readers for some very spirited remarks on the subject.\n\nThe first modern writer on farriery, whom we can mention, is Carlo Ruini, an Italian, who, in 1618, published at Venice his *Anatomia del Cavallo*. This work, of which very few copies are now to be found, is embellished with many copperplates, which, for the time when they were engraved, are very elegant. It is said that many succeeding writers on the anatomy of the horse have been indebted to them for most of their figures.\n\nWe now come to a period at which the veterinary art began to assume something of a scientific form. Many writers of eminence began to appear both in France and England, countries which have been the most distinguished for their attention to the management and diseases of domestic animals. As the French writers were the first, who did anything considerable towards the improvement of farriery, we shall trace the progress of the art in that country, before we examine the improvements it has received in England.\n\nIn 1698 Solleyef published his grand work, \"Le Solleyef.\"\nFAR R I E R Y.\n\nHistory.\n\nparfait Marechal,\" the complete Horseman, a work, which gained its author a high reputation, and was long the only guide, as well in farriery as in the manege.\n\nM. Solleyfel was principal riding-master in France, and this situation led him to pay much attention to the diseases of horses; and being a man of considerable abilities, and enlightened understanding, he saw the errors that prevailed in his time; and his genius and experience led him to expose and to correct them. His practical observations and remarks, which it would be out of place to particularize in this early part of our article, in general merit considerable attention. His observations on the external figure of the horse, and of his blemishes and defects, are also very valuable. It is much to be regretted that this ingenious author had not studied the anatomy of the horse, as he would then have avoided many errors and much false reasoning, into which his ignorance of anatomy betrayed him. Solleyfel's work passed through many editions, and was translated into most of the modern languages. A version of it into English was executed by Sir William Hope, one of his pupils, early in the 18th century.\n\nThe dreadful havoc committed by the murrain or epidemic diseases among horned cattle, that ravaged Europe during the first half of the 18th century, attracted the attention of medical men, and thus led the way to a greater improvement in the veterinary art, than it had ever before experienced. These epidemics were first described by two Italian physicians, Ramazzini, in a treatise De Contagione Epidemica; and Lancisi, physician to the pope, in a treatise De Bovina Pestis. But the most celebrated works on the prevailing epidemic seem to have been written by the faculty in France. Among the first appeared a memoir by M. Hermant, physician to the king.\n\nIn 1746 was published a memoir Sur la Maladie Epidemique des B\u0153ufs du Vivarais, by the celebrated zoologist Sauvages.\n\nAbout the middle of this century, the first steps were taken towards the establishment of schools for the public instruction of practitioners in farriery. One of the most celebrated of these was the veterinary college of Lyons.\n\nOver this institution presided the famous Bourgelat, a name that will be ever respectable in the history of farriery. Besides his office of professor at Lyons, he was inspector general of the veterinary schools in France; commissary general to the royal stables; honorary member of the Royal Academy of Paris, and member of the Royal Academy of Berlin. M. Bourgelat was a voluminous writer, and most of his works are still in much repute. In 1752, he published Elements d'Hippiatrique, \"Elements of Farriery,\" in 3 vols. The first volume is divided into eight chapters, comprehending the knowledge of the horse, as far as regards his external form. The first chapter treats of the denomination and division of the parts that compose the body of this animal; the second treats of the beauties and defects of the fore part of the horse, or what the French writers call l'Avant Main; the third treats of the beauties and defects of the several parts of the body; the fourth, of the beauties and defects of the hind part of the horse, or l'Arri\u00e8re Main; the fifth, of the different marks of horses; the sixth, of the means of ascertaining the age of horses; the seventh, of the geometrical proportions of the horse; and the eighth, of shoeing.\n\nThe second volume describes the anatomy of the horse, as far as relates to the bones, the integuments, the muscles, and blood vessels; and the third volume concludes the anatomy with a description of the parts that compose the head and chest.\n\nIn 1745, M. Bourgelat's materia medica, for the use of the veterinary pupils, came out. Soon after was published his Elementary Treatise on the Anatomy of the Horse, which is the most complete work of the kind that has ever yet appeared. In 1766 he published his Elementary Botanical Demonstrations, for the use of the pupils of the veterinary college. He likewise gave to the world a treatise on bandages applicable to the horse.\n\nM. Bourgelat also furnished many of the best articles on farriery for the French Encyclop\u00e9die.\n\nAbout this time appeared a number of works on the Buffon and manege, and on natural history, particularly a work by Daubenton, M. de la Gu\u00e9rin\u00e8re, entitled \u00c9cole de Cavalerie, and the celebrated natural history by M. de Buffon and Daubenton; but as these works have little connection with the diseases of animals, which they mention only incidentally, we shall not here particularize their contents.\n\nContemporary with Bourgelat, and equal to him in Lafoffe the celebrity, flourished Lafoffe the Elder, a member of Elder Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, and farrier to the king of France. He made many discoveries, and introduced several valuable improvements in the art of farriery, particularly an improved method of shoeing, and a treatise on the glanders. These were at first communicated in the form of memoirs to the French academy, and published in their annals. They were afterwards collected in 1754 into one volume, under the title of Observations et D\u00e9couvertes faites sur des Chevaux, \"Observations and Discoveries on Horses.\" We shall have occasion, in future parts of our article, to consider the merits of these memoirs, which were well received, and have contributed much to the advancement of farriery.\n\nThe elder Lafoffe also wrote some of the articles on farriery in the Encyclop\u00e9die.\n\nHe was soon followed by his son Lafoffe the Younger, who occupied the same post as his father, Younger and has acquired much reputation, by following his steps, and extending his improvements. He published, in 1766, his Guide de Marechal; or \"Farrier's Guide;\" a work well known in this country, though it has never, we believe, appeared in an English dress. It is divided into five parts, treating, 1st, Of the means of ascertaining the age of horses, and a succinct enumeration of the several parts; 2d, Of the blunders and tricks of farriers; 3d, Of the internal diseases of the horse; 4th, Of the external diseases, and the most important operations; and, 5th, Of shoeing. This work is characterized by M. Vitet, as one of the most accurate, simplest, and most precise, that had ever appeared. The anatomical part of the work is short, but comprehensive, and is illustrated by some tolerably good plates. It appears to have been a sort of text-book to a course of lectures on farriery, which were afterwards, in 1772, published in a superb form, with 65 coloured plates, under the title of Cours de Hippiatrique; or \"Course of\nThis work is extremely scarce in Britain, where, according to Mr Blaine, there are only three copies of it; one of which belongs to the Medical Society of Woolwich; another is in the hands of a Mr Mathaia, ci-devant pupil of the Veterinary College; and he believes Mr Morecroft has a third.\n\nBut the principal work of the younger Lafoffe is his Dictionary d'Hippiatrique, in four volumes, which is little known in this country, and which we have not seen. Mr Blaine calls it \"the best practical system of farriery that had ever appeared.\"\n\nIn 1803 was published an abridgement of M. Lafoffe's Guide, of which an English translation has lately appeared under the title of The Veterinarian's Pocket Manual. It is a useful little book, but it is a pity that the author or translator had not observed a more methodical arrangement.\n\nThough, for the sake of uniformity, we have mentioned the younger Lafoffe immediately after his father; there were many works published in France between the Memoirs and the Guide.\n\nIn 1755, M. Garfault published his Nouveau parfait Marechal, an improvement on the Parfait Marechal of Solleylel. It is divided into seven treatises; on the Conformation of the Horse; on Haras, or the Method of Breeding; on Stables; on the Diseases of Horses; on Operations; on Shoeing; and on Horse Medicines. This work is not without defects, but, for the most part, it is very good, and by no means deserves the brief character given of it by Mr Blaine in his History of the Veterinary Art, that it \"does not seem to merit any distinction in this place.\"\n\nThe articles on farriery in the Encyclopedie that had been written by Bourgelat and Genon, called forth a work from M. Ronden, senior, farrier to the larger stables of the king; who, in 1759, published Observations sur les Articles de l'Encyclopedie concernant la Marechallerie. They appear to be ingenious, and contain much practical information.\n\nIn 1763 there appeared at Paris a work on agriculture in two volumes 4to, entitled La Nouvelle Maison Rustique, which contains much useful matter respecting the breeding, management, and diseases of domestic animals, as well as fowls as quadrupeds.\n\nThe contagious epidemics among horned cattle still appeared occasionally in France and other parts of Europe; and many essays were written on them by various physicians, particularly by M. Bovand of Befanon, in 1766; by M. Leclerc and M. Barbaret, of Paris, in the same year.\n\nIn 1768 Daubenton, the celebrated naturalist, already mentioned, published a memoir on the mechanism of rumination in sheep; and in 1769, appeared a small volume entitled La Medicine des Beles a Laine; \"the Medical Treatment of Sheep.\"\n\nBetween 1776 and 1782, M. Vitet, a physician at Lyons, published his Medecine Veterinaire, in 3 vols 8vo, of which the first contains a pretty full account of the anatomy of the horse and ox, with some judicious remarks on the beauties and defects of both, and on some of the more important operations to which they are exposed; the second treats of the diseases of horses, sheep, and cattle; and the third gives an account of the remedies employed in veterinary medicine; and ends with a copious analysis of most of the continental writings, and a few English, that had appeared on the subject, from Vegetius to 1770.\n\nM. Vitet's work is, for the most part, a compilation from the best writers who have gone before him; but as he had read much, and appears to have selected with judgment, his book is one of those which may be consulted with advantage. We know that it bears a high character in France, and is often quoted with respect. We are therefore disposed to rate it at a higher value than a late writer has done; and are inclined to suspect that some of those who affect to think lightly of it are indebted to it for much more than the \"names of many of those who have written on this subject.\"\n\nMuch about this time, but in what precise year we cannot say, the abb\u00e9 Rozier, well known as the editor of the early volumes of the Journal de Physique, published his Cours d'Agriculture et de Medecine Veterinaire; a work of much reputation in France, but, we believe little known on this side the water.\n\nAnother work appeared about this time on the epidemics among cattle, entitled Recherches Historiques et Physiques sur les Maladies Epizootiques; \"Historical and Philosophical Researches respecting Epizootic Diseases,\" by M. Paulet. It contains an abridgment of almost all that had been written on the subject, and is particularly valuable for the account of the morbid appearances that were discovered on dissection.\n\nWe shall finish our account of French writers in the words of Mr Blaine.\n\n\"After the death of Bourgelat and Lafoffe, we hear Huzard of no character of any great eminence for some years; but it appears, that since the revolution, the subject has again been more diligently studied, and the names of Chabert and Huzard stand forward. Soon after, or about the time above alluded to, there appeared a considerable work, called, The Rational Dictionary of Medicine, Surgery, and Farriery, in five volumes; and very soon after, a Veterinary Dictionary, by Buchon; but it has no merit superior to that of Lafoffe. In 1787, M. Chabert published a Treatise on the Mange of Horses; since which he has likewise published upon the peripneumonia of black cattle. There has also appeared an Essay on the Grease of Horses, which gained the prize medal of the society for the promoting the health of animals; to which is joined a report on thick wind and on broken wind; but we are not aware who is the author. In 1788, there came out a treatise on the haras, with the method of hoeing, cutting, and all the lesser operations, translated from the Spanish of Hartmann, by Huzard. Likewise \"Instructions and Observations on Domestic Animals, with remarks on the breeding, rearing, buying and selling; with an analysis of previous authors, by Chabert, Handrin, and Huzard. The above authors have also published, conjointly, a Veterinary Almanack, containing the history and progress of animal medicine, since the establishment of the veterinary schools. In 1791, M. Lamagieu Lapole, veterinary surgeon, published observations on the health of the animals of St Domingo, dedicated to the veterinary college at Alfort. In 1797, M. Chabert and Oudinet, M. Huzard published, by order of government, a treatise vol i., on ascertaining the existence of the glanders, the means of preventing it, and destroying the infection.\"\n\nBefore we detail what has been done in Britain for the advancement of the art, we must take a cursory view.\nview of the principal writings that appeared during the 18th century in the rest of Europe.\n\nIn 1730, Goelicke, a German, published a treatise in 4to, *De Lue Contagiosa a Bovium*; \"On the Contagious Disease of Cattle;\" in which the symptoms of the murrain that raged in Flanders about that time are well described; and there are added the appearances on diffusion.\n\nIn 1734, appeared at the Hague a work entitled *La parfaite Connoissance des Chevaux*; \"The Complete Knowledge of Horses;\" by John Saunier, and Galpard his son. The latter boasts of this work, that it was drawn up from the lectures of his father, an experienced man; and that it contains the result of numerous experiments on subjects of every description, and diseases of every species; that it is the labour of the life of two men, the offspring of their continual application and study. After all their boasting, however, the work of Mynheers Saunier is little worth.\n\nIn 1745, and 1746, appeared two other treatises on the epidemic of cattle by Mauchard and Ens.\n\nIn 1749, the illustrious and indefatigable Linn\u00e9 published at Upsal his *Pan Suecicus*, in which there is little that relates to our subject, if we except a table of such plants as are eaten or refused by the domestic animals, which is curious and useful.\n\nSome time before 1756, Frederic Hafler, a Swede, published *Instructions for Improving the Breed of Sheep*, which was in much repute, and was translated into French.\n\nIn 1762, M. Reynier of Laufane published a treatise on a contagious inflammatory disorder that raged among horses and cattle, and which the Geneveese called *la louver*. This will be considered hereafter.\n\nIn the same year there appeared at Vienna a work on the epidemic of cattle by Dr Plenitz; and in 1765 Mich. Sagard of the same city published a work on a contagious distemper that the year before attacked the cattle in the circle of Iglaw in Moravia; and was attended with an appearance of aphthous crusts in the mouth.\n\nOf late veterinary medicine has been much cultivated in Spain, where the works of Hartmann are held in much esteem. In that country, it is said, a work on farriery in nine volumes has been lately published; but of this we know nothing.\n\nWe must not close our account of continental writers without mentioning the name of the illustrious Camper, whose works were lately collected and published at Paris. Besides a long description of the structure of the organs, and some lesser essays on comparative anatomy, these volumes contain an elaborate history of the epizootic disease that raged among the cattle on the continent in the middle of last century, in the form of lectures. We shall speak of this work hereafter.\n\nWe have thus brought the history of this art on the continent in a concise manner, down to the present time; and from it may be learned what improvements have originated there, and at what periods. It would appear, that when the science began to command attention, from the exertions of Francis the first, and Vegetius became studied, had it progressively improved in the degree it might be supposed to be placed by a conversation with this author, it would ere this have been more approximating to perfection; but instead of proceeding on the rational system of Vegetius, it dwindled again into ignorance of barbarity; and the recipes of manage-masters, and the operations of blacksmiths, were the only ostensible marks of its affluence. From this state the practitioner became in some degree routed by the improved system of Solleyfel; but he could only combat present errors, he could not point the way to future improvement, for he was ignorant of the groundwork whereon to build it, i.e. the anatomy of the animal. This defect was only in a small degree supplied by the labours of Ruini, and in some measure farther assisted by the demonstrations of Bourgelat. Many of the remaining errors were combated by Lafoffe with great advantage; and his experiments and discoveries on glanders, the rationality and improvements of his mode of shoeing, entitle him to great merit. Yet, though by these exertions, and by the establishment of veterinary seminaries, the art assumed a more regular and scientific form, its attainments were by no means adequate to its opportunities; which was almost wholly owing to an obstinate adherence to the humoral pathology, by which the treatment of internal and acute diseases continued inert and unsuccessful. Their prescriptions were filled with decoctions of simples, and they were utterly unacquainted with the medicinal virtues of the more active remedies in use among us. Under an opinion that the blood and humours were the constant seat of disease, they were continually wasting them with correctors; entirely ignorant or unmindful of the derangements of the solids, and of the connections between living blood and living vessels. Nor did this influence only their treatment of internal and acute diseases; but even of local and chronic affections: hence their mode of treating farcy, gout, and other complaints of a similar nature, were equally inert, and all evinced an erroneous pathology. Upon a careful and unprejudiced review of the state of farriery among ourselves, and on the continent of Europe, we are not inclined to think it had any advantages of moment at the beginning of the war in their favour; though it must be allowed, we are indebted to them for many improvements, and for the first hints towards the establishment of a regular school of the art among us. Since the war, our means of communication are so few, that we are not aware of what is doing among our neighbours. But though farriery, as a branch of veterinary medicine here, has kept nearly equal pace with its continental improvements, I do not think (says Mr Blaine,) the treatment of other animals, particularly of oxen, cows, and sheep, has been equally attended to; and, in this particular, I am disposed to think we are behind hand with them. Their severe visitations of the epizootic distemper have made them more attentive to this branch of the art.\"\n\nIn taking a view of the history of farriery, or veterinary medicine in general, in our own country, it will be seen, that we were much longer in improving the art, and reducing it under a rational and scientific form, than our neighbours on the continent. Our earliest writers on the diseases of horses and cattle, were deplorably ignorant, not only of all principles of general medicine and found practice, but even frequently of the common appearances of the diseases, which they professed to cure.\n\nOur first writers on the treatment of the diseases of Blundelhorses, ville,\nPart I.","sp":23,"ep":31},{"h":"PROVIDED THE PROPER","t":"d the proper means be taken in the early stage of the disease, the inflammation is commonly soon removed; but when the crystalline humour becomes opaque, no means hitherto employed have, as we shall presently see, produced any benefit.\n\nIn the treatment of this affection, it must be remembered, that the constitution is deranged, and that our remedies must therefore not be confined to local applications to the eye. General blood-letting will almost always be required; but, unless the horse is very fat or plethoric, this need not be repeated. It will be proper also to apply a blister or two to the head, as near the eye as possible, and the veins at the corners of the eye should be opened, to draw blood from that part. The horse must be put on lower diet, and should use only very moderate exercise; the stable should be kept well aired and cool; and if the horse's eyes are very sensitive, and the stable happen to have windows, these should be darkened. It will generally be advisable to give a purgative medicine; and the horse may drink frequently of some cooling liquor, especially of water, with nitre dissolved in it. Rowels have been sometimes recommended; and it is said that considerable benefit has\nPart VI.\n\nFAR R I E R Y.\n\nDiseases has followed the insertion of fetons as near the eye as possible. They have sometimes been palled through the white of the eye, just below the transparent cornea; but to this we should object, as being liable to produce specks that may extend to the cornea. As there is generally considerable dryness of the skin in this complaint, it may be useful in some cases to administer a gentle sudorific, such as a solution of two drachms of emetic tartar, or No. 22. of the receipts may be given.\n\nWith respect to the applications to the eye itself, those which appear the most likely to be of advantage, are stimulating substances, such as tincture of opium, solution of blue vitriol, red precipitate in the form of a soft ointment, such as No. 40. Sometimes, however, these stimulating applications do harm; and it is found that a weak solution of sugar of lead, or acetate of zinc, as prescribed in No. 31., are most useful. We must here take notice of an absurd practice that is in use among common farriers, of cutting away the hair, which they consider as a very principal part of the complaint. There is no doubt, however, that relief may have been procured by this operation, as it will generally be attended with a pretty copious effusion of blood, that will relieve the distended vessels; but as this effusion can be more easily produced by clarifying the red vessels of the white of the eye; and, by opening the angular veins, there is no occasion to take away a part, which is certainly of considerable use to the animal.\n\nSheep are sometimes affected with inflammation of the eye; but in them, as in most other animals, it is merely a local disease, and is generally relieved by topical bleeding. In the corrected agricultural report of Perth, it is stated, that the common practice in that district for relieving inflammation in the eyes of sheep is, to open the veins in the corner of the eye, and hold down the animal's head, so as to allow the blood to get within the eye. There is no doubt that this bleeding does good; and the introduction of the blood within the eye may, we believe, also be of service; not, however, in the way supposed by the reporter, but because it acts as a gentle stimulus.\n\nWe have already, in No. 324., made some observations on catarrh, and noticed the inefficacy of all the usual methods of treatment. It may not be improper here to add the result of Mr. Coleman's experimental attempts to relieve this complaint, as stated by Mr. Feron.\n\n\"The professor has begun with bleeding from the jugular or angular veins, and, at the same time, employing purgatives frequently repeated, as well as diuretics administered one after another. After which he has tried all the medicines of Mr. Phipps and Wathen, but without any degree of permanent success. The local and surgical treatment has been as follows, viz.\n\n\"1st, He has ordered scarifications, and to pass a feton through the membrana conjunctiva; but without effect.\n\n\"2ndly, We have removed some of the larger vessels going to the cornea, and divided them with the actual cautery, but with no success.\n\n\"3rdly, We have applied leeches to the conjunctiva, but without effect.\n\n\"Lastly, We have taken up both carotid arteries, which was of no avail, from the anastomoses, which the vertebral arteries form with them.\n\n\"Therefore, the treatment is confined entirely to Diseases, bleeding, purging, and diuretics; fomentations of warm water, in order to diminish the irritation from the tears that run over the cheeks; and plenty of moderate and continual exercise, so as to increase the perspiration.\"\n\n3. CATARRH. Catarrhus. Mor Foundering, or Common Cold.\n\nCatarrh has been placed by Dr. Cullen among the Catarrh, or profusivus, or fluxes attended with fever; we have ventured, with some modern authors, to rank it as an inflammation, because the increased secretion of mucus, which might entitle it to be called a profusivum, though sometimes pretty considerable, is not a constant, or often a very remarkable symptom of the disease; and in all cases appears to be the effect of an inflammatory state of the pituitary membrane. There are generally reckoned two species of catarrh, simple cold, and epidemic catarrh, or influenza. Though in the latter of these the catarrh is probably only symptomatic, we shall, in compliance with the usual custom, consider it immediately after common catarrh.\n\nThis disease attacks all the domestic animals; but horses and dogs are most liable to it, and in them the symptoms are most severe. It usually commences by a general dullness and heaviness, a dryness and increased redness of the inside of the nostrils, from which there soon proceeds an unusual secretion of mucus; a dryness of the eyes, or sometimes an increased effusion of tears. In a short time there is generally added some degree of cough and difficulty of breathing; and sometimes there is with these symptoms a considerable degree of heat and dryness of the skin; increased thirst, and not unfrequently a loss of appetite. At first the cough is dry, and sometimes continues so; but more frequently, when the complaint has remained for some time, a frothy whitish mucus is coughed up. The pulse is not always much affected in this disease; but in general it is fuller and harder than natural. The first symptom of the disease is not unfrequently a chilliness and trembling.\n\nThe principal causes of catarrh in domestic animals, as well as in man, are sudden changes of temperature, especially cold applied when the body is in a state of perspiration, or entering a warm apartment after having been long exposed to a cold air. Drinking cold water, when sweating, is also a common cause; and these causes are the more likely to produce their effect when the animal is in a plethoric state.\n\nIf neglected, catarrh may go on to inflammation of the lungs; in the horse it may produce thick wind, or even broken wind; in cattle it may end in chronic cough; and in sheep it may lay the foundation of consumption or pulmonic rot. It is also not unfrequently followed by the complaint called glanders, which we are presently to describe. An improper mode of treatment, especially giving cordials and other hot medicines, will hasten on these terminations of the disease. If attended to in time, and if the proper mode of treatment be adopted, the symptoms are, in general, soon removed.\n\nIf the complaint is slight, and there is little fever, it will often be sufficient to take the animal within doors into a warm stable, give him a warm bath, and put a cloth over him, when he will perspire through the night,\nDiseases, night, and be nearly well next morning. This plan will also answer, if it be adopted immediately, on perceiving the chilliness or shivering. If, however, considerable fever has taken place, and the animal's pulse is hard, it will be proper to draw blood, according to the urgency of the symptoms, before giving any internal remedy, or using warm clothing. After bleeding, a drench, composed of warm ale, with a drachm or two of salt of hartshorn, or half an ounce of spirit of hartshorn sweetened with molasses, will prove an excellent remedy; after taking which, the animal should be well rubbed down, and clothed as before. If the animal is coughing, back-raking, followed by clysters, will be advisable; and throughout the treatment coughs must be avoided. If there is considerable fever, the drench, No. 22, or 26, where coughs is to be obviated, should be given every four hours. Some practitioners advise balls in these cases, as in most others; but as there is often some swelling of the throat, and always considerable irritation about the faucets, it is better to give the remedies in the form of drenches. The cough seldom needs particular attention during the inflammatory state of the disease, as it will generally go off when the inflammation is removed; if it should continue obstinate, it becomes a chronic cough, and must be treated as directed under No. 436.\n\n4. Influenza, or Epidemic Catarrh.\n\nThe epidemic catarrh also affects all these animals, and has sometimes been known to attack a whole yard of oxen, horses, and cows, in one night. It differs from common catarrh in the degree of fever, which, in this complaint, is always very considerable, and is one of the first symptoms. There is a smart shivering, followed by considerable heat and dryness of the skin, and the fever is commonly attended with great heaviness and pain of the head, and affection of the eyes. In this complaint there is also a great degree of weakness, which comes on pretty early in the disease, and this weakness not unfrequently brings on a fatal termination of the disease. Sometimes there is a considerable discharge from the nostrils; at others this discharge is either trifling, or the nostrils are dry, in which cases the fever is most considerable.\n\nThe epidemic catarrh appears to depend on some peculiar state of the atmosphere; but there is no doubt that it is capable of being propagated by contagion. It is more prevalent in the spring, especially when this has been preceded by a mild winter. It is said, that when cattle are at these times exposed to currents of air from the north-east, they are most likely to be affected with it.\n\nIn the commencement of this disease, it will be proper to house the animals; but too much warmth must be avoided, as it would tend to increase the weakness that forms a principal part of the disease. It may sometimes be necessary, when the fever runs very high, to draw blood once; and, at any rate, it will be proper to apply a blister to the head, or on each side of the neck. Though warmth must be avoided, great care should be taken not to expose the animals to a draught of air. Warm baths may be given as in common catarrh, but when the fever has subsided, cordials and strengthening remedies will be required; and if the appetite is tolerably good, the diet may be more nourishing than usual. The animals should on no account be hard worked, but be allowed to rest from the time the disease is first noticed, except taking gentle exercise when their strength will admit of it.\n\nWhat is commonly called the distemper in dogs is now pretty generally considered as a sort of epidemic or contagious catarrh. We shall therefore treat of it in this place.\n\n5. Of the Distemper in Dogs.\n\nNo disorder is more general among dogs, than that distemper which is generally known by the name of the distemper in dogs, and none is so destructive. It is asserted that, except the plague, no disease is so fatal to the animal which it attacks.\n\nIt appears that this disorder has not been known in Britain, till within the last 50 years, but, during that time, it is astonishing what numbers of dogs have fallen victims to it. For these last fifteen or twenty years, however, the distemper has been less frequent, and has assumed a milder form.\n\nThe symptoms of the distemper are not alike in every case. The following are, according to Mr. Blaine, its usual appearances. It generally begins with a dry husky cough, attended with dulness and want of appetite, a running from the eyes and nose, and loss of flesh. As the disease advances, the dog appears much emaciated, and grows excessively weak, particularly in the loins and hind legs. Convulsive twitchings of different parts, especially of the head, come on, attended with dimness of sight; and, as the disease proceeds, and puts on a more virulent form, these twitchings degenerate into strong convulsive fits, which continue for a long time, and repeatedly return. In these fits, the dog foams at the mouth, runs round, and appears to be in great pain, and to have a constant desire to dung. This is sometimes attended with obstinate coughing, at others with violent purging. The stomach is extremely irritable; every thing that the animal takes being immediately thrown up. When the disease has reached this state, the animal seldom recovers, and is usually carried off in one of the convulsive fits.\n\nIn every part of this disease there prevails a want of energy, and a particular paralytic affection of the nerves. This latter symptom, in some instances, remains long after the disease has been otherwise removed; but, in general, the strength returns almost immediately on the removal of the other symptoms.\n\nThe distemper in its worst form is often mistaken for canine madness; but they may in general be distinguished, by attending to the following points.\n\n1st. The distemper seldom occurs except in puppies, its most common period being from six to twelve months. Madness may occur at any age, but seldom attacks puppies.\n\n2nd. In the distemper dogs drink freely; in madness, though they often attempt to drink, it does not appear that they are capable of swallowing the water.\n\n3rd. In the distemper the animal does not attempt to bite; but, in madness, the propensity to biting seems to be incessant.\n\n4th. In madness there appears to be a loss of reason at all times, though, as is said, they are so sensible, as to know their master; but, in the distemper, though there is sometimes a loss of reason, it lasts no longer\nIf, therefore, a young dog will drink, as soon as the effect of the convulsion is removed, but more particularly when his weakness is excessive, and strongly apparent in the intervals between the fits, it may be pretty safely concluded, that he is affected with the distemper, and not with madness. These circumstances, says Mr Blaine, should be carefully remarked, as they are unerring, and may save many a valuable animal from destruction, and many a timid mind from the most dreadful apprehensions.\n\nThe cause of the distemper is difficult to explain; nor do the most careful observations, in every stage of the complaint, ascertain more than that there is a general inflammation of the mucous membrane; but whether the true seat of the disease is confined to that membrane, and all the other symptoms are the consequences of it, or are real affections of other parts, is an undecided point, although, it is certain that its first appearance is by an inflammation of the pituitary membrane, and which is one of most lasting, as well as constant symptoms. That this inflammation is given from the membrane of the nose, to the upper part of the gullet and wind-pipe, is evident by the swelling of the glands of the throat, the tenderness and dry cough; and that this inflammation extends from thence to the same membrane of the stomach and intestines, is equally so, producing vomiting, coliciveness, or purging. It has generally, as we have said, been considered as a species of catarrh; but it has been suggested to us, by an ingenious friend, that, from several symptoms, as well as from its attacking dogs only once in their lives, it is more analogous to pertussis, or crouphia, in the human subject.\n\nWith respect to the cure of the distemper, Mr Blaine's directions and remedies appear to have been tolerably successful. With the nature of his remedy we are unacquainted, but believe it to be a preparation of mercury. This medicine has been made known by extensively advertising it, and although certificates of its utility are numerous, they make no part of the advertisement, but are to be seen at Mr Boofey's, in Old Bond Street, London, the wholesale agent; the form is a powder. Explicit instructions accompany it; and the price, considered with its asserted efficacy, bears no proportion, as no sportman would think five times the sum too much for the preservation of a valuable animal. Although so efficacious, it is nevertheless innocent enough for a child to take; nor must those who are advocates for strong remedies imagine, that, because the effects of this shake not the whole constitution, that the disease will not be eradicated by it. When the disorder is strong, after it is given, there is for the most part a gradual decrease of the symptoms, and nothing but a small moisture at the nose remains, which speedily disappears the next day. If the attack is flight, no more is seen of it, and the animal is at once well.\n\nFrom the varieties in the size, and consequent strength of dogs, a difference in the quantity of the medicine is necessary; the packets are therefore marked 1, 2, and 3. For a mastiff, pointer, fetter, or dog of a large size, No. 1, should be procured. Hounds, spaniels, and those of a middling size, require No. 2; and all the lesser dogs, No. 3.\n\nIt has been already observed, that, in the severity of the disorder, there is frequently so great an irritability of the stomach, that every thing taken into it is instantly thrown up; in such cases, the powder should be carefully mixed with a small piece of butter, at the same time adding to it thirty, forty, or fifty drops of laudanum, according to the age, size, and strength of the dog; who is to be watched, whether the medicine is retained, and kept as still as possible; but should it be thrown up, notwithstanding this addition, in two hours after the same quantity of laudanum should be given without the powder, in a little broth or milk, and half an hour afterwards the powder mixed into a paste with treacle, honey, or flour, and thus the vomiting will be prevented. Should there be at the same time obstinate coliciveness, it is probable that sicknesses may be the consequence of it, and must be removed before it will cease; twenty grains of jalap, or, in preference, fifteen grains of calomel, with four or five drops of laudanum, may be given in a small ball; or two table-spoonfuls of castor oil may, if more convenient, be used. Should these not stay on the stomach, a clyster with milk, salt, and oil, seldom fails to remove the coliciveness, after which the powder should be given, if there has been great sicknesses, with the laudanum; if not, without it.\n\nWhen, likewise, extensive purging accompanies the complaint, the laudanum should not be omitted; as by running off rapidly by stool, the effect of the medicine is equally lost, as if it were vomited up. In such case it will be proper to give before the powder thirty or forty drops of laudanum, with two ounces of olive oil. We should always attempt to remove the sickness and purging, or coliciveness, before administering the powder, as the effect of this will be then more certain. In the milder form of the disease, however, nothing is requisite but to give the powder in such a way, as that the dog may take the whole of it; for which purpose the powder should be well mixed with a small quantity of any thing that the dog will eat, or, if he is averse to eating, it should be made up into a small ball with honey, treacle, or butter, and forced down his throat. It must not be mixed with any liquid, as it is so heavy that it would fall to the bottom, and thus will probably be lost. Care should be taken to give the medicine on an empty stomach, as the effect will otherwise be lessened or destroyed; and the dog should be carefully watched to see if the medicine be thrown up, as, if this is the case, or if there is reason to suppose that the whole dose is not given, a second should be administered. Mr Blaine concludes with observing, that the symptoms remove without any particular appearance; yet so quickly, as that there is seldom any remains of the disease two hours after the medicines have been administered.\n\nMr Daniel has witnessed the extraordinary effects in the distemper, from Dr James's powder, given in the following manner. When the symptoms of the distemper are apparent, a third part of one of the parcels inclosed in the half-crown packets is to be given, mixed with a little butter, and the dog is to have plenty of warm broth, or milk and water, and, if possible, he is to be near a fire, or at least kept very warm. Two hours afterwards another third part is to be administered; and, should neither of these operate by vomiting or purging,\nat the end of four hours, give the remaining third. Should the two first portions have the effect, the remaining third should not be given until four or six hours (according to the evacuations) after the expiration of the four hours; in the interim the dog is to be encouraged to lap, and if he refuses, be forced to take plentifully of warm broth, or milk and water. Very seldom, even when the case is invertebrate, but the evacuations are brought on by the taking of one packet, generally by the second dose; but should it happen that there is no such proof of the powder's effect, the second parcel should be divided into similar proportions, and applied in the same manner, until the stomach is emptied. Warmth and warm liquids will quickly perfect the recovery. As soon as the dog's appetite returns, let him be fed (at first rather sparingly) with animal food.\n\nDr Darwin advises, that the dog be permitted to go about freely in the open air, and have constant access to fresh water. The use of being as much as may be in the air is evident, because all the air which we breathe passes twice over the putrid floggs of the mortified parts of the membrane which lines the nostrils, and the maxillary and frontal cavities; that is, both during inspiration and expiration, and must therefore be loaded with contagious particles. Fresh new milk and fresh broth should be given them very frequently, and they should be suffered to go amongst the grass, which they sometimes eat for the purpose of an emetic, and, if possible, should have access to a running stream of water, as the contagious mucus of the nostrils, both of these animals and horses, generally drops into the water when they attempt to drink. Bits of raw flesh, if the dog will eat them, are preferred to cooked meat; and from five to ten drops of opium may be given with advantage, when symptoms of debility are evident, according to the size of the dog, every six hours. If flogs can be seen in the nostrils, they should be moistened twice a day, with a solution of sugar of lead, or of alum, by means of a sponge fixed on a bit of whalebone, or by a syringe. The lotion may be made by dissolving half an ounce of sugar of lead in a pint of water.\n\n6. RHEUMATISM.\n\nThere seems no doubt that horses, and perhaps cattle, are affected with rheumatism, but it is sometimes difficult to ascertain the presence of the complaint, or to distinguish it from other causes that produce lameness. It may take place in any of the limbs, but it is more frequently observed to affect the hip-joint and the adjacent membranes; and when seated here, it is called the feia-tica, and sometimes the hip-gout. It will require considerable judgment to distinguish this complaint; but it may generally be known by attentively examining the limb in which the lameness is seated, from the hip down to the foot, and by attending to the canes that seem likely to have produced the lameness. In rheumatism the skin will be found dry, and the affected part swollen, and the lameness attendant on it will be more readily removed by exercise than that which has its cause seated in the foot, or which arises from bony excrescences. Rheumatism in the horse, as in the human subject, may be either acute or chronic, and the latter is the most obstinate.\n\nRheumatism, like catarrh, is produced by sudden changes of temperature, and by exposure to a cold moist atmosphere. It is no otherwise dangerous than as it renders the animal lame.\n\nThe cure of rheumatism differs according to its state. In the acute one bleeding may be proper; after which a warm bath, with two drachms of emetic tartar dissolved in the water, should be given, and the horse treated as directed under catarrh. If a sweat is produced, and kept up for some hours, the complaint will probably disappear, and its return may be prevented by frequent friction of the affected part, regular exercise, a nourishing diet, and attention to avoid changes of temperature. In the chronic rheumatism, bleeding will be improper; and the most likely means of relief will be, to rub the affected parts several times a day with some stimulating liniment, or, if convenient, to use the warm bath for a considerable time together, or to foment the affected limb for an hour or two every night, after which the limb must be rubbed perfectly dry. Pretty constant exercise will also contribute greatly to the cure, and coltiveness must be avoided. A blister applied over the affected part will sometimes do good. According to Mr Lawrence, the only cure to be depended on is a month's run of salt marshes in the spring, and being continued abroad in some shady place till autumn, afterwards mercurial physic, and the best stable care.\n\n7. INFLAMMATION OF THE LUNGS. Pleuritis. Peripneumonia. Pleurify. Peripneumony. Rising of the Lights. Rot.\n\nThe lungs are frequently inflamed in the domestic animals; and, as in man, the inflammation may be seated in either in the membrane covering the lungs and lining the chest, or the pleura, or in the substance of the lungs, constituting the two varieties, pleurify and peripneumony.\n\nThe disease has been called by common farriers, rising of the lights, from an idea that the lungs protruded against the throat, and caused that difficulty of breathing which is one of the principal symptoms of this complaint. The other vulgar appellation of rot seems to owe its origin to the appearance which the lungs sometimes present on dissection, being found in a state of mortification, and partial decomposition, as if they were rotten. It is of little consequence to distinguish the two varieties of the disease, as the treatment is the same in both.\n\nAccording to Mr Feron, the symptoms of inflammation of the lungs in the horse are invariably as follow. The respiration is quick, the breath hot, the extremities cold, the tongue dry and hot, the flanks heaving, the patient never lying down, which forms a very characteristic symptom; and sometimes he hangs down his head. If nothing has been done, it is hardly possible to save his life, after three days have elapsed; and, after death, the right side of the heart is found to have been inflamed, and, on some occasions, so much distended with blood as actually to burst, and the lungs are found to resemble putrid liver, the cells filled with blood, from the great distention of the pulmonary arteries, and perhaps sometimes effusions take place; the pulse is oppressed, from the great distention occasioned by the blood in the right side of the heart, while the left side of that organ is weak, from want of sufficient blood.\n\nTo Mr Feron's account it may be added, that the pulse,\npulse, at the commencement of the disease, is generally more full, harder, and more frequent than natural; but, as soon as the disease reaches the stage at which it is usually first observed, the pulse has become small and oppressed, and but little increased in frequency; the veins of the neck are swollen and prominent, and the eyes are generally red and starting. There is sometimes cough, at others none; but the difficulty of breathing is always great, and the horse stands extended, panting for breath, with heaving flanks and open nostrils, till, no longer able to support himself, he drops down and dies. This fatal termination sometimes takes place in a very short period; in 48, 36, or even 24 hours.\n\nThe only disease with which this can easily be confused, is colic; and the discriminating marks will be mentioned when we treat of this disease. At present it will be sufficient to remark, that when a horse appears dull, holds his head very low, breathes with difficulty, especially during inspiration, stands constantly, has a quick heaving of the flanks, a fullness of the eyes, and redness of the inside of the nostrils, and when the pulse is small and oppressed, he may almost certainly be declared affected with inflammation of the lungs.\n\nIt may not be improper to give a brief explanation of the symptoms which we have enumerated; and they are chiefly to be explained from the difficulty with which the blood passes through the lungs, on account of the unusual accumulation in the pulmonary vessels. Hence the difficulty of breathing, and the aversion that the horse expresses to lie down; for it is evident, that he will breathe more easily in a standing posture than if he were lying; because, as was remarked in the table of the extremities of the muscles, some of these act on the chest, when the fore legs are fixed, and thus assist in carrying forward the ribs, and thus increasing the cavity of the chest. The impeded passage of the blood through the lungs also explains why the pulse is weak and oppressed; and hence, when this obstruction is relieved by lessening the quantity of blood, the pulse never fails to become stronger and fuller.\n\nThe causes of inflammation of the lungs are doubtless sudden changes of temperature, especially when the animal is plethoric; it is probable that the most common cause is a sudden change from heat to cold and moisture. It is at present, however, more fashionable to consider the reverse of this as the general cause of pulmonary complaints; and we understand that Mr Coleman goes so far as to say, that horses are never attacked with inflammation of the lungs from exposure to simple cold, for, that the turning of horses to graze without preparation, though it may render them emaciated, seldom produces the complaint in question. Mr Feron also, who may be considered as a pupil of the veterinary college, is of opinion, that inflammation of the internal viscera proceeds from a sudden transition from a cold to a hot temperature, but seldom or never from a hot to a cold one. We are aware that these gentlemen have borrowed their theory from Dr Beddoes, and it is of little consequence to our present purpose, whether it be correct or not.\n\nThe judgment to be formed with respect to the termination of this disease, which is always highly dangerous, will depend on the urgency of the symptoms, and on the changes that take place after the exhibition of the usual remedies. If the pulse becomes fuller and stronger after bleeding; if the breathing becomes less difficult; if the parts where blisters have been laid inflame soon, and the blisters rise well; and, in particular, if the horse lies down, and seems less distressed, we may hope that the danger is lessened; and if these favourable signs continue for 24 hours, we may consider a cure as pretty certain: but, if the pulse still continues small and oppressed, more especially, if it becomes quick and irregular; if the difficulty of breathing continues or increases; if there is a rattling in the throat, with partial cold sweats and extreme dejection; a fatal termination must be looked for, which will speedily take place, if the breath becomes cold or fetid. It is considered as a very unfavourable symptom when the horse appears insensible to external stimuli; as when blisters do not rise well, nor rows easily suppurate.\n\nIn the cure of inflammation of the lungs, everything will depend on the speedy adoption of the most vigorous measures, and the first and principal remedy is bleeding. This should be performed as soon as possible, and to a greater extent than in most inflammatory diseases. It will scarcely be proper to take less than five or perhaps six quarts at first, and the bleeding must be repeated, though less copiously, some hours after, if a considerable remission of the symptoms does not take place. It must not be expected that the pulse will rise much after a second or third bleeding; but, if it is not considerably weakened, and if the oppressed feel of it is removed, we may be sure that the bleeding has not been carried too far. Another principal means of checking the internal inflammation is, to excite an inflammation externally near the seat of the complaint, by every means in our power. A large blister should be applied on each side of the chest, and to the inside of the fore legs; a rowel should be inserted below the chest, and if the symptoms are very urgent, another near the belly. Mr Coleman recommends inflating the cellular membrane below the skin with air, so as to bring on an inflammation between the skin and muscles; and if this does not succeed, he advises that some stimulating fluid, such as oil of turpentine, be injected. We should suppose this carrying inflammation rather too near the lungs; but from some trials that Mr Coleman has made, and some others of Mr Feron, this method seems to have been attended with considerable advantage. In addition to these means, the fore legs should be well rubbed two or three times a day with oil of turpentine, or the liniment in No. 42. of the receipts. These are the external means that are chiefly to be relied on; and if these be followed up speedily, and with proper attention, there will seldom be any occasion for internal remedies. If these be given, they must be such as are calculated to cool the body, and check inflammation, such as the drenches No. 22. and 26. especially the latter, as it is necessary to keep the bowels open. Perhaps foxglove might here be given with advantage, as directed under that article, at 290. Mr Feron recommends diuretics, and a ball composed of an ounce and half of emetic tartar, a drachm of opium, and 15 or 20 grains of calomel. We do not know whether this is the practice of the veterinary college, but it appears to us to be inconsistent with the bleeding and other evacuants which are generally found most successful. As cottivenes would tend to increase the inflammatory symptoms, back-raking and the occasional use of mild clysters,\nclysters, will be requisite. In general, warm water, or this with a little Glauber salt dissolved in it, will be sufficient, as all heating purgatives would do harm. The horse should be kept rather warm, should be clothed, and should drink frequently of warm gruel. Food will not be requisite, and, if set before him, he would probably not touch it. Exercise of every kind must be avoided, at least so long as the inflammatory symptoms continue.\n\nThe most favourable termination of this complaint is by resolution, when the inflammatory symptoms go off without producing suppuration or ulceration of the lungs; but sometimes this state is unavoidable, an ulcer is produced, and, if the matter is not thrown off, it may either produce suffocation, or bring on hectic fever and consumption. When it is found that a cough remains after the inflammation has subsided, and a quantity of mucus is thrown off, the evacuation of this should be promoted by gentle expectorants, and the horse must still be kept warm. Though the matter may be completely expectorated, there will generally remain a difficulty of breathing, or thick wind, when inflammation of the lungs terminates by suppuration. Sometimes there is left an anaerobic or droptical state of the lungs, and in these cases it is said that blue vitriol and turpentine, to the amount of two drachms of each, mixed into a ball, with a proper quantity of linseed powder, and given every morning, have been beneficial. It may also be proper to apply a blister over the wind-pipe.\n\nInflammation of the lungs in cattle differs little in symptoms, and nothing in the treatment, from that which we have been describing in the horse.\n\nThe lungs of sheep are very frequently affected with inflammation, which forms one of the diseases that has been confounded under the name of rot. It most frequently attacks young sheep, especially those of the more delicate breeds; and it is most prevalent in damp pastures, and during unfavourable seasons. The symptoms of this disease in sheep have not been well described, but they probably differ from those in horses and cattle, only in degree. It does not appear to be so speedily fatal, although the animals seldom or never recover from it. Towards the latter stage of the disease there is considerable weakness; and at this time there appears below the jaw an oedematous swelling, containing a quantity of fluid, which is easily evacuated by piercing the tumour. This tumour is called the pock in Scotland. On opening the bodies of sheep that have died of this species of rot, the lungs are found full of knots or tubercles, similar to those which appear in human subjects that have died of pulmonary consumption, and sometimes the lungs appear mortified or rotten. The liver, however, in these cases is found, which distinguishes this variety from the other diseases called rot.\n\nWe do not know that this disease admits of a cure in sheep, though it might probably be prevented by housing them, or affording them shelter, at those seasons when it is most likely to occur.\n\nInflammation of the lungs occurs sometimes in dogs, but it does not seem to be very frequent in these animals. It requires pretty much the same treatment as in the horse, except that here emetic tartar may be given in such a quantity as to excite considerable sickness, without vomiting. This would be improper in the horse, as it would be difficult to regulate the dose of the medicine, so as not to produce such an irritation of the stomach as might considerably increase the animal's distress, and augment the difficulty of breathing.\n\n8. Inflammation of the Liver. Hepatitis.\n\nWe have no doubt that inflammation of the liver takes place occasionally in most of our domestic animals; and it is probably a more frequent disease than is generally supposed. Both species of it, viz. the acute and chronic, may appear in these animals, and it will appear presently, that the latter is a very common disease among sheep. Though dissection has clearly shewn, that the liver in cows, horses, and sheep, has been affected with inflammation during the life of the animal, yet any account of the symptoms of this disease that is given us by the veterinary writers, is so obscure, that we cannot pretend to give anything like a perspicuous history.\n\nAccording to Mr Blaine, this disease, considered as a distinct affection, is seldom met with in the horse, though, when great abdominal inflammation exists, the liver often partakes of the general disease. In the description of the symptoms, this author states that it is usually accompanied with coliciveness, for the gland ceases to secrete the bile from its being in an inflamed state; and that bile which was secreted, is not poured into the intestine, but becomes depolished in the skin, producing jaundice, which is known by the yellowness of the eyes and the tongue. The pulse is generally full, hard, and frequent, but the pain not very intense. It would be difficult to detect it, unless by the symptoms of fever, accompanied with yellowness of the mouth and eyes. There would possibly be pain in the shoulder as in the human, in which case the horse might on trial be found lame.\n\nIt is easy to see, that this description is a fanciful picture of the disease, drawn from the analogy that the author supposes to exist between inflammation of the liver in man and the same disease in horses; and it is probably not to be depended upon.\n\nThe writers on cattle medicine describe the symptoms of the disease in cattle to be a difficulty of breathing, evident marks of fever, yellowness of urine, a swelling about the short ribs, and an unusual diffusion about the barren or womb. Here the symptoms of an acute and chronic distemper seem to be confounded.\n\nAs for the symptoms of the disease in sheep, in whom it forms one of the varieties of rot, we have seen no ac-in sheep. Count of them any further than as they are confounded with those of the other varieties of rot, and, as such, they will be noticed when we come to treat of the rot in general. If this disease could be detected in its acute state, the cure would probably not be difficult; but when it appears in the chronic form, it is, we believe, seldom removed.\n\nWhen the bodies of such animals as have died of inflammation of the liver are opened, the liver has been found in various states of disease; sometimes it is harder and firmer than usual, and very frequently there are parts of it that are scirrhouss and discoloured, resisting the knife when we attempt to cut through them. Sometimes the biliary ducts are almost bony, and there is commonly found in them, and sometimes in other parts of the liver, a species of worm called fluke; the *felicola hepatica*\nDiseases. hepatica of naturalists. Sometimes there are ulcers or abcesses formed in the liver, and frequently, especially in sheep, this organ is mortified or decayed.\n\nThe causes of this disease are very obscure; in horses and cattle it is said to be most common in hot seasons and warm climates, and that such of these animals as are fat are more exposed to its attacks. It may also be brought on by blows or bruises on the short ribs, by which the liver may have received some injury. In sheep it is said to be more common in dry weather, especially when the animals have but a scanty supply of food, and when they are of a cottive habit. It is supposed by many, that this species of rot owes its origin to the flukes that we have described, as found in the liver after death; but, as these flukes have been found in the livers of sheep that had never been apparently affected with the rot, and, as they are frequently found in the livers of old sheep, this cause is probably rather fanciful; though when these animals are very numerous, or when they are situated in a very sensitive part of the liver, they may excite a degree of irritation, and consequent inflammation, just as a great quantity of bots in the stomach of horses have been found to bring on inflammation of that organ.\n\nIn attempting the cure of this disease, when it is ascertained to be present, we must consider whether it is acute or chronic. When it occurs from injuries, it will probably be of the former kind, but in most other cases it will be chronic. Acute inflammation will require bleeding, purging, blisters, and low diet, as in all other cases of internal inflammation; but, in chronic hepatitis, the most likely remedy is mercury, which may be administered either internally, in the form of calomel or corrosive sublimate, or externally rubbed into the skin on some parts of the animal's body. This mercurial friction may be performed with tolerable ease on the sheep, by pulling off the wool from the inside of the thighs, and rubbing a drachm or two of the strongest mercurial ointment upon these parts every night, till the general system becomes affected, which may be known by the swelling of the gums, offensive smell of the breath, and increased flow of saliva from the mouth. This, however, would be an expensive and tedious cure; and if many of the flock appear affected, it would be better to kill them as fast as possible, before the disease has made such a progress as to render the animals lean. If a mercurial course should be attempted, the animals should be housed during the course, and should be kept on good nourishing food. Coffiveness must be avoided in all these cases, by the administration of gentle clysters, or occasional doses of opening physic. A very good medicine, in all cases of liver complaints, is a ball composed of calomel and soap, as directed under jaundice.\n\n9. Inflammation of the Stomach. Gastritis.\n\nThe stomach may be inflamed, both in horses and cattle, from various causes; but this is a disease, the existence of which is not easily detected. Here also Mr Blaine has supplied the want of observed symptoms by analogy, and has supposed that there would probably be unsuccessful efforts to vomit; and, as the stomach is so effectual an organ, the pulse would probably be affected even more than in inflammation of the bowels; that the animal would perhaps point to the left side about the tenth or eleventh rib; that there would be great distress evident in the countenance and manner, and that the loss of strength would be very great.\n\nIn cattle there are generally reckoned two species of inflammation of the stomach, one affecting the first stomach or paunch, and the other the third stomach or manyplies. This latter is commonly denominated lake-burn. The symptoms of the disease in these animals are also very obscure, but they are probably similar to what have been described above.\n\nIf the reader looks back to No. 409, he will see detailed, a case that occurred to Mr Clark, in which inflammation of the stomach was observed, and detected after death; and though the symptoms there described are few, they are probably more characteristic of the disease in question, than any imaginary description which we can copy from writers who have never seen the complaint.\n\nThis disease is extremely dangerous, and will not admit of a cure, unless effectual means are taken at its commencement.\n\nInflammation of the stomach is commonly produced by some acid, irritating substance which the animal has swallowed, and this is the effect produced by most poisons. A large quantity of cold water drunk while the animal is in a violent perspiration, will also produce it. It not unfrequently accompanies inflammation of the bowels, which we are immediately to describe. It is said to be sometimes produced in cattle by the giving of too strong a dose of astringent medicines to cure the red water or bloody urine; and as we have seen in No. 409, it may sometimes be occasioned by bots.\n\nThe disease can only be cured by very copious bleeding, frequently repeated; by giving mucilaginous drinks, such as water gruel or linseed tea, applying a large blister just behind the short ribs, and the frequent administration of relaxing clysters. If poison has been swallowed, we must proceed as recommended under No. 407, though in most cases of inflammation of the stomach, it will be the most humane plan to effect a radical cure by shooting the animal through the head, or cutting his throat.\n\n10. Inflammation of the Bowels. Enteritis. Red Colic. Inflammatory Colic. Dry Braxy in Sheep. Tranch\u00e9e Inflammatoire ou Rouge, Fr.\n\nThis is a disease, to which all the domestic animals are subject, but it is attended with somewhat different symptoms, in the several species.\n\nIt is generally preceded by more or less fever. In horses, the first remarkable symptoms that appear, are a great degree of restlessness, with loss of appetite, thirst, with considerable heat, and dryness of the mouth. The animal evidently labours under violent pain, and is perpetually lying down and getting up again, scraping and stamping with his feet, with which he sometimes strikes his belly. When the belly is touched with the hand, the horse betrays extreme sensibility, and shrinks from the touch. The pulse is always increased in frequency, and is hard, giving the sensation of a cord below the finger. The skin feels unusually hot, all over the body, except at the ears, which are said to be cold. The tongue is commonly covered with a white fur. Coffiveness is almost a constant symptom of this disease, and\ntill the inflammation is subdued, this continues very obstinate, or, if the animal dungs, it is in very small quantity, and the excrement is very hard. The urine is voided in very small quantities, and with great pain, especially towards the latter period of the disease. The symptoms go on with more or less rapidity, till the inflammation is subdued by the proper remedies, or till it terminate in the death of the horse.\n\nReturning health may be expected when the heat of the body gradually lessens, while the pulse becomes full, regular, and of the natural frequency, when the horse dungs freely, and returns to his usual appetite, and cheerfulness. But when there appears a sudden relief from pain, with a soft, feeble, or irregular pulse, and a purging of offensive black matter comes on, mortification of the bowels has taken place, and the horse will expire in a few hours.\n\nOn opening the body, evident marks of high inflammation appear in many parts of the bowels, the outer or membranous, and muscular coats of which will be found red, and in some parts black. The inflammation is frequently found to have extended to other parts, as the stomach, liver, or bladder; to some of which the guts will be frequently found adhering. On opening into the cavity of the bowels, these will be found greatly distended with air, and the great guts loaded with hardened excrement; and sometimes the inner membrane will appear highly inflamed, or even corroded, shewing evident marks of its having suffered considerable irritation, from some acrid substance.\n\nInflammation of the bowels is distinguished from colic, by the frequency and cord-like feeling of the pulse, by the presence of fever, by the tenderness of the belly, and by there being little or no remission of the pain. It is said that in colic the horse rolls much on his back, but is not so apt to do this in inflammation of the bowels. It will be seen by and by, that a long protracted colic frequently terminates in inflammation.\n\nInflammation of the bowels may be produced by acrid or poisonous substances taken into the stomach. It has been sometimes produced by giving heliobore to horses, as a purge; and it is said to arise sometimes from giving purgatives at improper times, or in too large a dose. It is very commonly brought on by giving the horse cold water, when he is much fatigued, and so much overheated, as to be in a profuse sweat, or by dashing cold water upon him, by wading in cold water, or by standing in a draught of cold air, under similar circumstances of fatigue and sweating. Constipation too long neglected, or entangled rupture, is also not an uncommon cause.\n\nIn the treatment of the inflammation of the bowels, as in all other internal inflammations, we must begin with copious and repeated bloodletting, after which a free evacuation of the bowels must be attempted by back-raking and the injection of softening clysters, such as warm water-gruel, mixed with half an English pint of castor oil. All acrid clysters must be avoided, as they will only tend to increase the inflammatory affection of the bowels, and even Glauber salts and other saline purgatives are scarcely proper, from the irritation they may produce. After bleeding and evacuating the bowels, warm fomentations applied to the belly may be of service, and the cloths should be applied as hot as possible. After the fomentation, the belly may be rubbed with some stimulating liniment, such as oil of turpentine, or essence of mustard. Firing has been recommended below the belly, as also frequent friction with the curry-comb, so as to irritate the skin, and almost make it bleed. Probably no medicine should be given by the mouth, farther than softening, diluting drinks, such as warm water-gruel or linseed tea. Food at the beginning of the disease is out of the question; but when the inflammation is a little relieved, the horse may have a bran mash. The body should be kept warm by clothing, and all exercise should be avoided.\n\nInflammation of the bowels in sheep is called dry braxy in Scotland, and of this disease we have an excellent account in Mr Findlater's survey of Peebles.\n\nThis disease is most fatal to young and robust sheep about six or seven months old, called in many parts of the island, hogs. It is more destructive upon some farms than others; and even upon these, in one season more than another. In a hog fence, or pasture capable of keeping 30 score of hogs, there is in some years, a loss from three to four score. This is a very serious matter, as each of these would sell in the spring, or beginning of summer, for half a guinea or 11s. This disease begins at those times when inflammatory disorders are most apt to prevail, in the months of October and November, and is produced by the common causes of inflammation, cold, exertion, external injury, &c. During these months, flight frosts set in, and the ground in the morning is often covered with hoar frost, or what is called in some parts of Scotland rhine. It is probable, that eating grass covered with hoar frost, may be one cause of the disorder. If so, moving the animals about, and preventing them from eating, until the frost is melted by the sun, may tend to prevent the disease.\n\nThis disease runs its course very rapidly. When the shepherd leaves his flock at night upon their laires, he sometimes observes a hog look dull, loitering behind, and restless; sometimes lying down and suddenly getting up again: and in the morning, he will often find it dead, or nearly so. At other times he will discover no apparent ailment among his flock; and in the morning, he may find one or two dead or dying. From this it appears that the disease is very acute.\n\nThis is further evinced by the appearances after death, when the carcases are opened. Their bellies are excessively swelled, and distended with a putrid air: the whole intestines being red and inflamed, gangrenous, and in some degree mortified. This putrid taint seems to be communicated to the whole carcase, as all the muscular parts, and fat, smell strongly of corruption. The hogs that die of this disease, are frequently fat and in good order, which shows that the disease is of short duration.\n\nWe have already mentioned the eating of grass, which is covered with hoar frost, as a very probable immediate cause of this disorder. But is there any predisposing cause?\n\nIn answer to this question, we shall adduce a fact which is well authenticated. Many parts of the western highlands of Scotland, had been for ages occupied by horses and horned cattle. At the introduction of sheep into those districts, the best grass was that which had sprung from the tush and excrements of these animals. During many years after these districts were converted into sheep farms, braxy remained unknown. It crept\nin at last, and the severity of the disease was long in proportion to the length of time the pastures had been occupied by sheep.\n\nFrom these we would infer that pasturing upon their own land, is a predisposing cause of bravety among sheep; and that a frequent alteration of the species of stock, upon every fresh pasture, might serve to prevent the evil. This idea corresponds with the general laws of the Supreme Being, who certainly never intended that this earth should be monopolized by any particular species of animals; but has so ordered matters, that the happiness of individuals shall result from the happiness of the whole family of animated beings.\n\nHence it would appear a beneficial practice in those farmers, in place of one fence, to keep two or more enclosures of this description, and change the flock upon them every season. This we know to be contrary to general practice, and that what is called the hogs fence, is carefully guarded against the intrusion of every other animal.\n\nLambs, immediately after they are weaned are frequently sent to poor pasture, which is called burning them. Now this appears to be a very bad practice; for the consequence is, that they fall off considerably, before they get at the rich grass in the hogs' fence, of which they eat too freely; and thus become disposed to the disease treated of. Children, and all domesticated animals, are carefully fed with nourishing food for a considerable time after they are weaned; and yet they fall off for some time. It would certainly be better to give the lambs the hogs fence at once, and use every precaution to prevent them from falling off.\n\nAs the disease is generally advanced to a dangerous height before it is observed, we fear that medicine affords but a very faint hope of cure. The disease being inflammatory, the shepherd should attempt to bleed the distressed creature as soon as possible; which he can easily do, by cutting off part of the tail, or by nicking it underneath, or by cutting off part of the ears. The animal should then be removed to a house or shed, and attempts made to produce evacuations. In brute animals, it is difficult to produce these by medicines administered by the mouth. The quickest and most effectual method, is by injections into the rectum or anus. Such injection may consist of a small handful of chamomile flowers, two spoonfuls of aniseed, and as much caraway seeds; to be boiled slowly in a Scotch mutton or English pint of milk and water, until the half is evaporated. The liquor should then be strained off, and two tea spoonfuls of castor oil added, or if this is not at hand, the same quantity of sweet oil may be used. This should be administered warm by an injection bag and pipe, or by an elastic gum bottle with a pipe properly fitted. Nothing can be easier, than to give a sheep a clyster in this way; and, in all probability it will have a happy effect in evacuating the bowels and procuring relief.\n\nIf this does not appear very soon, it may be repeated an hour after, and a large spoonful of common salt added to the former ingredients. If, after all, the animal does not seem relieved, another clyster may be given, consisting of a small tea cupful of warm milk and water, to which are added from 20 to 25 drops of laudanum.\n\nAs there is a great dilution of the stomach and bowels, arising from airs or elastic vapours, generated in the intestines, Mr Walker of Cumberland, in a treatise he wrote upon the diseases of brute animals, has suggested a remedy for this disorder, which has often proved successful in his district. It consists in pushing down their throats a flexible tube, such as Dr Monro has recommended, and which has proved successful in relieving cows that had over gorged themselves with red clover early in the season (see No. 405.). This seems a probable means of affording temporary relief, and every shepherd that has the care of the hog flock, should be furnished with one of these tubes, adapted to the size of the sheep, for trying the experiment upon those that labour under the disease.\n\n\"In regard to the quality of pasture (adds Mr Findlater) as a cause of sickness, Tweeddale farmers seem of opinion that it arises from the foulness of the grass at the root in the hogs fences, which are never eaten bare. Some, therefore, take care to have the land to be saved for the hog fence, once eaten as bare as possible early in summer, by the black cattle upon the farm, or by old sheep.\n\n\"It seems ascertained in Tweeddale, that land which has been in use to be pastured by older sheep, when converted into a hog fence, is not liable for some time to produce sickness. Two accidental experiments occurring in which this practice took place, in consequence of new arrangements in the farms of Harehope in Edendale parish, and of Lyne in Lyne parish, confirm this conclusion. It is farther confirmed by an experiment of Mr Murray, tenant in Flemington mill. About 20 years ago, he bought in different parcels of lambs for hogs, and laid them upon the hog fence of his hog farm of Broughton-haup, in Broughton parish. In one of the parcels of much higher condition than the rest, the sickness broke out to such extent, that they were dying at the rate of two or three daily; so that the whole parcel seemed in imminent risk. He transferred this whole parcel to the farm of Fingland in Newlands parish, where only old sheep were kept, putting them on some of the lower pasture of that farm, which had been harnessed for feeding the crock ewes, and transferring a proportional quantity of these ewes to Broughton-haup hog fence. Not one of the lambs died upon Fingland. To the same effect, it deserves attention, that in small farms, not admitting of distinct hirling, where, of course, old and young sheep pasture mixed together, hogs are very little liable to sickness, though perhaps worse in other respects.\n\n\"From November at sowing time till Christmas (1797) two facts with regard to the mode of cure have been stated to me, and which I am disposed to think authentic. In the farm of Drummelzier, parish of Drummelzier, three hogs (out of four upon which the experiment was tried) recovered, upon bleeding, and having poured down their throats, a decoction of tobacco; about a finger's length of twist tobacco boiled in water till the water has diminished to a gill, being the dose for each. In the farm of Broughton-haup, parish of Broughton, within the same space of time, nine or ten (out of 16 or 17 upon whom the experiment was made) recovered upon bleeding, and having an injection of tobacco smoke administered from a common tobacco pipe, by kindling the tobacco, inserting the pipe shank into the anus and blowing; the experiment, however, was not so successful.\"\nI have long ago seen a ewe cured by bleeding, and injection of Glauber salts from a common clyfter-bag and pipe. When braxy breaks out, it might be useful, where attainable, to lay the hogs, nightly, upon dry ground, if the hog fence is wet, the chilliness of wet ground contributing no doubt to the production of inflammation. Clover faggage or turnips might be good preventives from inducing a lax\n\n**II. DYSENTERY. Molten-grease or Body-founder, Break-blow, (in sheep). Gras fondu, Fr.**\n\nDysentery is the other disease that, with catarrh, forms Dr Cullen's order of profusia; but as there are evident marks of inflammation of the bowels observed on inspecting the bodies of such animals as have died of this complaint, we have placed it immediately after inflammation of the bowels, in which we have followed M. Pinel and some other late writers.\n\nThis disease is not uncommon in the horse, and probably it is still more frequent in cattle and sheep. It very commonly begins with some degree of fever, as a trembling, dryness of the mouth, loss of appetite, a great degree of weakness, drooping of the head and ears, sometimes a copious sweating, but more commonly dryness and heat of the skin. There is usually a heaving of the flanks, and the animal turns his head towards them, as if gripped. There are frequent defecations from the anus, but these seldom consist of the natural excrement, but of a mucous, slimy discharge, accompanied with a peculiar fatty substance like soft fat. There is evidently much distress during these evacuations, and sometimes the fundament appears excoriated. It is not uncommon to see blood pass with the stools, generally in streaks, but sometimes in such a quantity as to tinge the whole discharge of a red colour; and in the latter stages of the disease there generally appear membranous, fatty substances, which have been compared to soaked leather. These substances have been supposed to be the inner membrane of the bowels that has been eroded and thrown off by the violence of the purging; but they are merely coagulable lymph, such as is very commonly thrown off from inflamed surfaces. The pulse, towards the beginning of the disease, is commonly hard and full, but as the complaint goes on it becomes quick, small, and sometimes irregular. The animal is very stiff, and much averse to motion, and if the disease continues long, there usually comes on a swelling of the legs.\n\nWhen animals that have died of this disease are dissected, the inner coat of the bowels is found inflamed, in some places covered with coagulable lymph, such as we have described as being thrown out in the discharge, and not unfrequently ulcerated in various parts, sometimes mortified and corroded.\n\nThis disease does not appear so dangerous among the inferior animals in this climate, as in warmer countries; but it sometimes proves fatal, or terminates in a weakness of the bowels and scouring, that are not easily removed. If the fever is but little or soon abates, if the animal appears not to labour under much pain, and if the discharge of natural excrement soon returns, the disease will probably terminate favourably in a short time; but if there is great pain and fever, with excessive weakness, and if the mucous discharges continue very frequent, and mixed with much blood, the danger is considerable.\n\nIt is necessary to distinguish this complaint from the common purging or scouring, with which it is very generally confounded. It must therefore be observed, that in scouring, there is no fever, whereas this is common in dysentery; that the discharge in scouring, though thin, has almost always the appearance of excrement, is not bloody, and is scarcely ever mixed with fatty matter.\n\nDysentery is more common in hot weather, and in hot seasons, than at other times; but is very commonly produced by the sudden application of cold, especially to the legs or belly, while the body is overheated and fatigued; hence swimming in autumn, drinking large quantities of cold water while in a profuse sweat, or other sudden changes from heat to cold, have commonly produced it. It is said to be frequently brought on by riding a horse very hard in hot weather. Mr Lawrence says that when a boy, he rode a horse that had a great deal of loose green flesh about him, 21 miles in a warm summer morning, and thus brought on an attack of molten grease. It is also not an uncommon disease among polo horses.\n\nFrom the appearance of the fatty matter in the discharge that takes place in this complaint, the older writers on farriery were induced to give it the name of molten grease, conceiving that a principal part of the disease consisted in a melting down of the fat of the animal, which being conveyed by the absorbents into the circulation, is thrown out by the exhalants on the bowels, and carried off with the dung. Mr Blaine laughs very heartily at this idea, and seems to pride himself on the discovery, that what has been mistaken for fat, is nothing more than an increased secretion of the mucus of the intestines, and is as liable to a horse with little fat, as to one with much. Mr Lawrence, on the other hand, argues strenuously that this matter is really greasy, and says, \"with respect to the evidence of sense,\" had Mr Blaine ever seen a horse under the discharge of molten grease, he might have found on experiment, that part of the discharges in question is inflammable and liquefiable, which are not the characters of albumen, but of real grease; and, (continues Mr Lawrence) viewing the matter through the medium of experience, I can see no sort of improbability in a colligation of loose, substantial, internal fat, by sudden inflammation, and its consequent effusion and discharge by an unusual emunctory. Gibbon gives an instance which convinced him (apparently incredulous before) of the possibility of a horse's grease being melted. He found the fat melted and turned into an oil, and drawn off from its proper cells into the blood vessels. He says farther, this disease is not unlike the greasy diarrhoea which happens to men.\" Not having ourselves seen a case of dysentery in horses, we are not prepared to decide the difference between these two champions of the old and new school, but as Mr Lawrence is very worthy of credit in whatever has passed under his own observation, we have no doubt that this debated substance is of a fatty nature.\n\nAs it seems certain that dysentery is of an inflammatory nature, it is proper to begin the cure by bleeding, especially if the horse is plethoric, or if the pulse is full and hard. It will then be proper to clear the bowels by\nDiseases by a laxative clyster, and to give internally a drench composed of five or six ounces of Glauber's salt dissolved in a quart of water-gruel, or the drench No. 26 of the receipts; and this may be repeated every three or four hours. This will probably, in the course of the day, produce a plentiful discharge of excrement, and when the bowels appear well cleared, the horse may have a warm bath, be covered up warm, and perhaps a perspiration will be brought on, which, if the disease is slight, will probably complete the cure. If the disease should continue, an English pint, or pint and a half, of castor oil may be given, and clysters, composed of water-gruel, or starch boiled in water, should be given warm very frequently. When by these means a pretty copious discharge of excrement has been produced, the horse may have a ball composed of two drachms of opium, and half an ounce of ipecacuanha, or a drachm of emetic tartar, washed down with a quart of good porter. If there is considerable pain, it may be advisable to foment the belly for half an hour at a time, with flannels wrung out of a warm decoction of poppy heads. During this treatment the horse should be kept clothed, and currents of air in the stable should be avoided. When the disease is subdued, as the horse will probably remain very weak, it will be proper to revive him by nourishing diet, and cordial and strengthening remedies.\n\nThe appearances of dysentery in cattle are not unlike those that occur in the horse, only that perhaps in them there is not so much of the gras fondu. The disease among these animals is commonly called far-del-bound. The treatment is the same as above described.\n\nThis disease is not uncommon in sheep, by the name of break/bow; but shepherds very commonly confound it with diarrhoea or purging. Mr. Loch of Rachan, very properly distinguishes between them, and observes that the break/bow is analogous to dysentery in the human species, and occurs most commonly in the end of wet summers. The discharge is thin and greenish (Mr. Loch supposes from the wet grass becoming acid in the stomach, and turning the gall green); it is more or less mixed with blood, sometimes florid, sometimes black and grumous; the animal pines for a week or two and dies, though sometimes he recovers. The cure commonly employed by Mr. Loch's herd, is warm milk poured down the animal's throat; but Mr. Loch proposes to try, in addition to this, nitre in half drachm doses, with chalk or some other absorbent powder, and 20 or 30 drops of laudanum twice or thrice a day, with frequent injections of warm milk and water. This plan seems best adapted to the latter stages of the disease. According to Mr. Gillespie of Glenquich (quoted by Mr. Findlater), this disease is often produced by overheating, when the sheep are hunted by dogs, in folding them, &c., or when otherwise scared and terrified. It is stated by Mr. Gillespie to be considerably infectious; and he considers tarring part of the flock to be the best means of checking the infection, under the idea that the smell of the tar will overcome that of the contagion.\n\n12. INFLAMMATION of the Kidneys. Nephritis. Strain of the Kidneys.\n\nThis disease is not uncommon among horses and cattle; but it is more frequent in the former, as they are more exposed to those causes that appear generally to produce it.\n\nThe symptoms of this disease in horses, are tolerably well marked. The horse stands wide with his hind-legs, appears dull, and expresses considerable pain, often looking at his flanks. When pressure is made on the loins the horse flinches, and is evidently much distended; the pulse is hard and full, and commonly more frequent than natural. When both kidneys are inflamed, little or no urine is secreted, and what little is evacuated is generally bloody; but when only one kidney is inflamed, the other continues to secrete urine, but the natural quantity is on the whole much diminished, and there is commonly considerable pain during the evacuation.\n\nInflammation of the kidneys is liable to be confounded with inflammation of the neck of the bladder, and the best means of distinguishing them, is to pass the hand up the fundament, by which the state of the bladder beneath may be easily ascertained. If the bladder be considerably distended with urine, the inflammation is almost certainly seated in the neck of the bladder; but if the bladder be shrunk and empty, the disease is probably situated in the kidneys. It must be allowed, however, that this mark of discrimination will not hold good till the disease of the kidneys is pretty far advanced, as it very commonly happens that when a gland is inflamed, its secretion is at first increased. At the commencement of the disease, therefore, the symptoms which we have enumerated, especially the tendency which the horse evinces on touching his loins, are chiefly to be depended on. It must be remarked, that one of the kidneys has been found diseased, and even putrefied, after death, when it showed no marks of inflammation during life. This disease is attended with considerable danger, and unless the inflammation be speedily removed, matter will be formed, which, if it does not pass off by the urinary pipes into the bladder, will find a passage into the belly, or behind the peritoneum, and produce hectic fever and consumption, or the kidney may mortify, and death will soon follow.\n\nThe kidneys may become inflamed, either from external injury, or from irritating substances that pass through them in the course of the circulation. Inflammation of these organs is frequently produced by placing the saddle too far back upon the loins, and riding hard for a long time while it is in this position. It is sometimes the effect of throwing cold water upon the body while it is in a sweat; but according to Mr. Blaine and Mr. Feron, it is most frequently produced by the indiscriminate use of strong diuretic medicines.\n\nIn the treatment of this disease, we must vigorously employ the means that we have so often recommended for the cure of internal inflammations; bleeding in its full extent, emollient clysters, and the production of external inflammation: but it is necessary in this disease to caution the practitioner against the use of blisters, as the matter of cantharides, when taken into the circulation, and carried to the kidneys, will considerably increase the inflammation and distress. A good substitute for blisters of cantharides would be, to pour hot water on the loins, so as to raise a blister on each side, which, however cruel it may appear, could not produce so much pain, as the animal already feels from the disease. It has...\nhas been recommended, to excite a degree of inflammation in the external part of the loins, by means of firing; but probably the hot water will do as well, and is less painful. No medicine should be given by the mouth, that is in the least heating or irritating; and nitre, turpentine, balsam of copaiva, &c., so warmly recommended by most of the writers on farriery, would only serve to aggravate the disease. The horse may drink frequently of water gruel, linseed tea, or such other mild, mucilaginous liquors; and if he seems to require food, bran mash will be the most proper article of diet. If there is much coliciveness, purgative clysters may be given, or in cases of necessity, fix or seven drachms of colocynthine alone in a ball. All exercise must be avoided, and the horse should have a good bed of litter, on which he may lie down when fatigued.\n\n13. Inflammation of the Bladder. Cystitis.\n\nThe bladder may be inflamed either in its body, or in its neck, and the symptoms differ somewhat in these two varieties. When the body of the bladder is inflamed, there is produced such a degree of irritation, that the bladder becomes incapable of retaining its contents for any length of time; and the animal is perpetually making small quantities of urine. He also makes frequent attempts to dung. On palpating the hand up the fundament, the bladder will be found very hot and sensible; and in this variety of the complaint, as in inflammation of the kidneys, it is empty and collapsed.\n\nWhen the neck of the bladder is inflamed, there is at first a suppression of the urine, but afterwards it is continually passing off in drops; and on examining the bladder by the fundament, it will be found more or less distended, according to the continuance of the complaint. There is usually considerable fever in both cases. The pulse is hard and full at the beginning of the disease, but after this has continued for some time, the pulse becomes small and oppressed.\n\nInflammation of the bladder takes place more frequently in males than in females; animals; but it is said to be sometimes produced in the latter, at least in mares, by palping some irritating substance up the urethra, in order to make them horly. Both cases of this disease are attended with considerable danger; but the latter is generally the most dangerous; but in a mare a cure is generally easier than in a horse.\n\nThe treatment of this complaint differs little from that of the inflammation of the kidneys, and chiefly consists in bleeding, the frequent use of softening clysters, low diet, and the production of external inflammation by any other means than the use of cantharides blisters. If the bladder be found considerably distended, it will be necessary to evacuate the urine, either by the means of a catheter, which may be easily palped up in a mare, or by making an opening into the bladder; for performing which in the male, Mr Feron gives the following directions. \"It happens that the urethra is so constructed, that it is not in our power to introduce an instrument immediately into the bladder, without performing an operation; for the urethra of the horse forms two curvatures or angles, before it reaches the bladder, and therefore it is not possible to introduce an instrument into the bladder, which will preserve its curvity all the way. We therefore introduce a staff of a pliable wood, or whalebone, to the angle at the os pubis, as near the rectum as possible with safety; we make a cut upon it, and then introduce the female catheter, or some similar tube, without however removing the staff to prevent our losing the incision, taking care to avoid the instrument's pushing into the cellular membrane, instead of entering the bladder. If such an accident was likely to happen, it is advisable not to attempt the operation, but to continue and insist upon all the emollient remedies.\n\n\"We may also puncture the bladder with a trocar, by the rectum, or through the inferior part of the abdomen.\n\n\"In either case we are likewise directed by Mr Coleman, to make the puncture as near the os pubis as possible, that we may not wound the peritoneum anteriorly. By this method the operation recommended through the rectum may be performed without exposing, or opening the cavity of the abdomen.\"*\n\nIn the female an opening may be easily made into the bladder, with a trocar, introduced by the vagina.\u2020\n\nIt has been recommended in the mare, to throw up an injection of some oily or mucilaginous fluid, to supply the place of mucus, in sheathing the bladder from the irritation of urine. As in the inflammation of the kidneys, every thing that can heat or irritate the urinary organs must be carefully avoided.\n\n14. Cords.\n\nIt is well known in most breeding countries, that a great many calves die every year, of an unknown disease, with which they are affected very shortly after birth. The common name which this disease receives in Scotland, is the cords; and while its fatal and widely extended effects are the subject of just regret, the disease itself is looked on as incurable, and no pains are taken to investigate its nature, symptoms and causes, and no remedies suggested, as a cure or preventive. Whatever be its nature, this disease is exceedingly dangerous, and so extremely rapid, (terminating frequently in a night's time), that all means of relief are commonly useless even before it is observed.\n\nAlmost all calves, that are said to have died of the cords, appear, when they are opened up, exceedingly red, and the small leaders, or ligaments, are considerably swollen, and have some resemblance to strings palping through the internal parts, from which probably the disease has its name. Every symptom indicates a considerable degree of plethora, if not a very high degree of inflammation.\n\nIt is commonly observed, that calves are most liable to be affected during the first days, or weeks, after they are calved. If they outlive five or six weeks, they are seldom in any danger.\n\nCalves that suck their mothers, we believe, it will be found, are not so liable to the disease, as those who are fed by the hand.\n\nThe greatest number of calves who fall a sacrifice to this disease, if not the whole of them, are those who are closely confined to the house from their birth, without ever being exposed to the free open air without doors. It is a well known fact, that calves who are dropt without, and remain in the fields, are in little or no danger. Cows that are laid on to graze for beef frequently turn out to be in calf; and it is no uncommon thing to see them drop their calves in the midst of frost and snow, and yet\nthese young creatures, if they can once get to their feet, without being frozen to the ground, are hearty and well. Calves, lambs, and foals, require exercise and fresh air; and nature directs them to take a great deal. It is astonishing to see with what force and vigour, (particularly the calf), and how long, they will run. But this free, unconstrained, and severe exercise without doors, seems to be the very thing that makes them thrive, and to be necessary to their very existence.*\n\nThe great object is to prevent this disease; and the following method of treating the new-born calves, practised by a correspondent of the Farmers Magazine, seems to be attended with complete success.\n\nThe time when this gentleman's cows are bulled is regularly noted down in a book; and when they are near calving, they are watched frequently night and day. As soon as the calf is dropped, it is received into a large basket or skull, made of willows, with a handle at each end, and plenty of clean straw in it. It is then carried by two persons to the stall in the calf-house, where it is gently rubbed with straw. The calf-basket is next to the cow-brye; and is fitted up with flails like a stable, about three feet wide, and about five feet long. Every stall thus in itself, with a door and hinges, for fear of the calf lying back too far, to choke itself in its binding. As soon as the mother has had a little rest after calving, she is milked, and a little of the milk given to the calf as early as possible. If the weather is cold, and the mother long in giving milk, it is taken to the fire, and warmed in a pan until it is blood-warm, and then given to the calf; about six or eight gills, according to the size of the calf, and repeated four times in 24 hours. As the calf gathers strength, the quantity may be increased; but too much milk at one time is as bad as too little, until it is a month or six weeks old. When the calf is able to stand, it is tied to a stake; as it is more in the power of the servant to give it milk in that situation, than when going about loose. If a calf gets cold milk, it is sure to bring on a trembling; and the cords or some other malady follows; which he has often seen exemplified amongst the neighbouring young stock\u2020.\n\n15. Farcy. Le Farcin, Fr.\n\nWe shall conclude this chapter with a brief account of two diseases; or rather, as it should seem, of two modifications of the same disease, that frequently take place in the horse, to whom they are almost peculiar; though something like them is occasionally found in other animals. We shall hereafter take notice of what farriers call the water farcy, which we consider as similar to angina in the human body; but the disease we are about to describe, appears to be rather a peculiar inflammatory affection of the absorbent vessels below the skin. There seems to be two varieties of farcy, acute and chronic; or rather a mild and a malignant variety.\n\nThe commencement of farcy appears to be rather obscure, and probably it is seldom observed in the beginning of the inflammation. The first appearances that are described by writers, are a number of swellings, that rise in almost every part of the body, particularly the head, neck, and extremities. The lymphatic vessels below the skin appear like knotted cords; and this appearance is found to be owing to a dilatation and inflammation that take place in these vessels, especially at their valves, where the knots are produced. As the disease proceeds, these knotted swellings burst, and ulcers are formed, which are very difficult to heal. The formation of these ulcers may be considered as terminating the mild stage, and commencing the malignant form of the disease; in which the horse loses his appetite, grows lean and weak, and commonly has a degree of hectic fever. If the progress of the disease has not been arrested, a swelling takes place in the head and nose, and there comes on from the latter a copious discharge of a peculiar glairy mucus, which shows that the disease has degenerated into glanders, under which name we shall proceed to describe it; and shall afterwards consider the nature, causes, and treatment of both.\n\n16. Glanders. Le Morve, Fr.\n\nAccording to Mr Blaine, the usual symptoms of glanders are an increased secretion of the mucus of the nose, which is at first thick, and like the white of an egg. He has seen it continue so, while at other times it becomes purulent; but there is usually a degree of viscidity and glueiness about the matter, that as it were fixes the sides of the nostrils together, and is strongly characteristic of this disease. On examining the nostrils, there may generally be perceived a number of ulcerated surfaces, very similar to blisters that occur in the venereal disease. These ulcers do not always appear soon; but they are produced in all virulent cases, and never fail to appear when the disease terminates fatally. They are at first small, and disposed in lines along the lymphatic vessels; but as the ulceration proceeds, it becomes more extensive, till the whole inner surface of the nostrils is affected, and at length the bones of the nose are affected, and become carious. When the ulcers have continued for some time, the matter changes its glairy appearance, and becomes bloody and offensive; and this is more particularly the case when the bones become diseased. In the latter stages of the complaint, the emaciation and weakness of the animal are greatly increased; he becomes affected with a short tickling cough; the hair grows dry and harsh, and falls off on the slightest touch, and thus the horse gradually pines away.\n\nSometimes only one side of the head is affected, but more commonly both at the same time.\n\nThe best account of the appearances of glanders on dissection, has been given by M. Chabert, in a work which he published in 1785, on the means of ascertaining the existence of glanders, and of preventing their effects. From the numerous bodies which he opened, M. Chabert has drawn up the following general account of the morbid appearances.\n\nThe lungs are generally more affected than any other of the viscera; we find them often swelled and filled with hydatids, tubercles, and obstructions. The bronchial glands are very often swelled and ulcerated, and this is sometimes the only injury that we can perceive on dissections. The membrane that lines the bronchia and the wind-pipe, is most commonly inflamed and ulcerated; the bronchia are filled with a thick matter, that commonly resembles what the animal discharges by the nostrils. The internal surface of the bones that form the different cavities of the nose, and the grilly partition of the nostrils, are often carious, and covered with purulent matter; and the membrane which lines the nostrils...\nnostrils is ulcerated. The spleen, the liver, and the kidneys, are also sometimes considerably diseased; and the ulcerated state of the kidneys, not unfrequently appears during life, by the purulent matter that is discharged with the urine. On opening the head, we sometimes find the brain softer and more flaccid than in a healthy animal. There is often a great quantity of serum in its cavities, and the glands are much swollen.\n\nThe glanders is liable to be confounded with several of those diseases, in which an unusual discharge proceeds from the nostrils; as catarrh, strangles, and consumption; but chiefly with the two former. It may be distinguished from catarrh, by the absence of fever in the early stage; by the matter discharged from the nostrils being thick and glairy from the first; whereas, in catarrh, there is almost always considerable fever in the beginning, and the discharge is at first watery. In a common cold the general health is also more or less affected, and from the first there is usually a cough and loss of appetite; whereas, these symptoms scarcely ever come on in glanders, till the disease has subsided for a considerable time. Glanders may be distinguished from strangles by the high fever which commences the latter, and by the swelling and speedy suppuration of the glands of the mouth and throat.\n\nOf these two affections, glanders is the most dangerous; as farcy, when taken at its commencement, may frequently be removed; but we believe the instances of a perfect cure in glanders are very rare.\n\nThe causes of these complaints are very obscure. It is said that farcy may be brought on by the same causes that predispose to mange, as want of cleanliness, hard work, and low diet; and there is no doubt, that this disease, as well as glanders, is contagious. Glanders, besides being produced by contagion, may also be the termination of several disorders, as of catarrh, strangles, and consumption, however different from these diseases in their commencement.\n\nThe nature of glanders is not well understood, although, of late, many ingenious men have investigated the subject, and made considerable discoveries. It is not certain when the disease was first known. Mr Lawrence dates it from the same period with the Lues Venerei; but there seems no doubt that the disease was known to the ancients, though we do not know by what name it was called. Vegetius speaks of a disease which he calls humiditas, which Mr Blaine supposes to be the same with our glanders; but which the learned Camper considers as analogous to the murrain, See No 466. Blundevil, and after him Markham, give the following description of its rise, progress, and completion. \"Of cold first cometh the p\u00f6l\u00e9, (that is stoppage of the head), and the cough, and then the glanders, and last of all the mourning of the chine.\" The two Messieurs Lafoffe, made, as we have seen, several discoveries with respect to glanders, especially the father, who, in 1749, demonstrated before the academy of sciences at Paris, that the seat of the disease is wholly in the pituitary membrane; and he proposed curing it by injecting the whole of this membrane through openings made with the trepan, into the frontal, nasal, and maxillary sinuses. Lafoffe divided the disease into several species; but it appears that all these may be reduced to two, the mild and malignant, or the chronic and acute; the chronic being that in which the running of the nose is trifling, and of a transparent colour, with no appearances of ulceration in the nostrils; while in the acute or malignant variety, there is considerable ulceration; the discharge is very offensive; there is a swelling below the under jaw, and the bones of the nose are carious.\n\nThe best of the English writers on farriery appear to have known little or nothing of the disease more than the symptoms. Dr Bracken considered it as not contagious, and Gibbon gives but a poor account of it, for which he seems indebted to Snape.\n\n\"The late professor of the veterinary college (says Mr Blaine), published his remarks on this disease, but it is evident that he knew little or nothing relating to it, but what he gained from Lafoffe, and consequently his opinions offered nothing new. The present professor has prosecuted the inquiries relative to it much farther, and by an extensive course of experiments has thrown very considerable light on the nature of the disease; and though we are not yet much more successful in attempts at the cure, yet we have less reason to despair. By Mr Coleman's experiments it is proved beyond a doubt that farcy and glanders are specifically the same disease, but affecting different parts: to establish this, horses have been inoculated with the matter of farcy, and glanders has been produced; which puts the matter beyond a doubt. Further, Mr Coleman produced glanders in a found animal by the inoculation with the matter of glanders. This M. St Bell affected could not be done. Farcy has likewise been produced by the same means, but it appears that it was some time before it could be effected; but it has been produced by Mr White. It cannot therefore be inferred, that because the farcy and glanders are so different in their apparent situations they are distinct diseases: every poison has its preference of parts; and likewise the same poison, under different modifications affects different parts.\n\nMr Coleman is of opinion, that in glanders, the whole circulating fluids are affected. To prove this, he bled an ass from the jugular vein till he was to all appearance dead, when he introduced the blood from the carotid artery of a horse labouring under glanders, till the ass was reanimated. In a few days the most malignant glanders appeared. I believe another ass was inoculated from this, which became glandered. This experiment, I think, (adds Mr Blaine), throws great light on this complaint, and indeed on pathology in general; and we may hence be led to hope, that internal remedies may be more useful than external, which have been thought to be the only means by which we could hope for a cure; for provided we could destroy the poison existing in the blood, and keeping up the action in the part; the action, or at least the specific part of it, might cease in the affected part, and we might induce a healing process by the usual means. As such, our only hope must consist in exciting a new action in the system, whereby the glanderous one will be suspended, till by the continuance of the new action the virus of glanders is completely expelled by the change the fluids naturally undergo.\"\n\nThe treatment of these diseases will differ according to their state and degree of malignity. For the cure vol. ii. p. of 525.\nDiseases of farcy, blisters are much extolled by Mr Feron, and the actual cautery, is very generally employed to destroy the swellings of the lymphatics, and to excite these vessels into greater action. To assist this purpose, diuretics are to be administered, and the horse should take as much exercise, especially draught labour, as he will bear without considerable fatigue. Two remedies have of late been employed internally, when the system becomes considerably affected; these are verdigris, and corrosive sublimate. Mr Feron directs the former to be given in the following manner. A ball composed of one drachm of verdigris, and a quarter of an ounce of common turpentine, is to be given every night and morning, gradually increasing the quantity of verdigris till the horse can take from three drachms to half an ounce in the course of the day. If the animal becomes colicive, he is to have a clyster night and morning, and a purgative ball of seven drachms of aloes, and half a drachm of calomel once a week. After having gone through a regular course of physic, he is to have the following balls. An ounce of green copperas (x) in powder is to be mixed up with Venice turpentine, and a sufficient quantity of linseed powder, to make eight balls, one of which is to be given every morning, while coltiveness is to be avoided as before directed.\n\nIn giving the corrosive sublimate, we should begin with a small dose (see Stimulants), and gradually increase it so long as the stomach will easily bear it. As mercury in some form seems to be the best remedy that can be employed in these affections, calomel, or the common blue pill, may be given instead of the corrosive sublimate, if the latter should occasion much disorder, or if the horse is very much weakened. During this course the animal must be supported by nourishing diet, but should frequently have a change of succulent vegetable food. Mr Blaine speaks of a horse that was so far reduced (by glanders, we suppose) as not to be able to stand, and who was drawn into a field of tares, and suffered to take his chance; the consequence was that when he had eaten all within his reach, he was able to rise and search for more, and eventually recovered.\n\nThe treatment recommended above has, it seems, often been successful in farcy, and the same internal remedies have been recommended in glanders, but we believe they have been employed with little success. Mr Feron advises to draw blood in the beginning of glanders, while the disease is still local, and to keep the animal upon warm mashes of bran, putting the same into a nose-bag, for the purpose of fomenting the nostrils. He is then to go through a course of gentle physic, while strict attention is paid to the necessary direction of the food, exercise, dressing, cleanliness, and water. The water must be always warm, and made white with bran or gravel. After this course, he recommends balls made of opium, arsenic, and sulphur, or of extract of hemlock, calomel, &c., avoiding coltiveness during their exhibition. He thinks it necessary to insert two rows, one below the under jaw near the swelling, and another under the chest; and he recommends frequently syringing the nostrils with a lotion made of two ounces of spirit of wine, and the same quantity of vinegar, mixed with a gallon of water; or with a solution of corrosive sublimate. According to this gentleman, if the disorder is attacked in its infancy, it will generally submit to the above course of treatment; but if the disorder is so far advanced as to exhibit the symptoms of virulence, which we have described as constituting the acute or malignant stage of it, it will increase in opposition to all art, and it will be necessary to take away a life that every degree of affluence would not render worth preserving.\n\nAs the farcy is probably contagious, and the glanders in most cases is certainly so, it is proper, as soon as a horse is affected with either of these diseases, to keep him in a separate stable, and to take care that he does not come near any other horses; and no part of his harness, or furniture should be used for any other horse, till it has been well washed with soap and water, and exposed for a long time to the pure air.\n\nGlanders is considered by Dr Darwin, and some other writers, as a contagious catarrh, and in some cases it certainly is so; but when it is the consequence of farcy, or of dangerous chronic diseases, it appears to be an affection of a peculiar kind. Mr Lawrence considers the glanders as so perfectly incurable, that he recommends the collarmakers knife as the easiest, cheapest, and most infallible remedy.\n\n**Chap. III. Of Lethargic or Comatose Diseases.**\n\n1. **Apoplexy.** Vertigo, Fr. Staggers, Sleepy Staggers, Lethargy, or Vertigo.\n\nStaggers is one of the most comprehensive terms in apoplexy, farriery; and under it are confounded almost every affection of the brain, or all those diseases in which there take place giddiness, unusual heaviness, drowsiness, or convulsions. We have already seen the term applied to inflammation of the brain, and we have no doubt that many cases are described as staggers, which are really instances of epilepsy. Of this kind we consider the case so humorously related by Mr Lawrence in his treatise on horses, vol. ii. p. 426. \"Walking up Fleet-street, I observed a crowd of people wonderfully diverted with the agonies of a cart-horse beating himself almost to pieces, in, I think, the most violent convulsions I ever witnessed. He threw himself repeatedly upon the foot-path, and was very near going headlong into a shop, &c.\"\n\nMr Feron, who in general keeps very clear of the errors of ordinary farriers, which he often ridicules with much success, has confounded inflammation of the brain and apoplexy, under the general name of staggers, considering them as both inflammatory, and merely modifications of the same disease. Even Mr Blaine, who, as Mr Lawrence expresses himself, seems upon every occasion eager to catch the dernier go\u00fbt of science, has\n\n---\n\n(x) Mr Feron directs green copper; but we suppose this is merely a typographical error, for copperas, or sulphate of iron; and we have therefore ordered it by this name, as sulphate of iron is a good tonic, and may be very properly employed in this disease.\ndescribed flaggers under the name of lethargy, and does not even mention its identity with apoplexy in the human body.\n\nWe consider flaggers properly so called, as the same with apoplexy; the appearances, the causes, and the treatment of both are the same, making allowance for some slight variations in the structure and economy of the different animals whom they affect.\n\nThis complaint sometimes comes on suddenly; but in general it is preceded by symptoms that mark a considerable determination of blood to the head, such as heaviness, drowsiness, insensibility, (see No. 317) occasional fits of giddiness, (see No. 318.) and partial blindness, (see No. 321.) There seems no doubt that the horse is sometimes affected with headache, which appears by the animal's hanging down his head and drooping his ears, by the eyes being dull and watery, by dropping of urine, and coliciveness. These symptoms often precede an attack of apoplexy, though they are sometimes only signs of a disordered stomach.\n\nWhen a fit of flaggers comes on, the animal falls suddenly, and is perhaps convulsed for a few minutes, but more commonly appears quite insensible. The pulse during the fit is usually slower than natural, and much oppressed; the breathing is slow, heavy, and laborious, and there is evidently an increased accumulation of blood in the vessels of the head. The animal remains for a longer or shorter time in the fit, and sometimes he never recovers; but, in general, in eight or ten minutes, the fit goes off, and the animal rises. Sometimes after a fit of the flaggers, the animal appears for a time more active and lively than before; but very often he remains heavy and sleepy, especially after repeated attacks, and sometimes a paralytic affection of some of the limbs is the consequence of the fit.\n\nApoplexy may be distinguished from inflammation of the brain, by the fever, restlessness, and fiery appearance of the eyes, that never fail to usher in the latter complaint. We would distinguish it from epilepsy, by the foaming at the mouth, and strong convulsions, by which this latter is always accompanied.\n\nAn apoplectic fit may be the consequence of an overloaded or otherwise disordered stomach; and is no uncommon termination of several diseases, as epilepsy, locked jaw, &c. But it is generally the consequence of too much fullness of blood, brought on by a full diet, attended by idleness or want of exercise. It is more common to old than to young animals, especially such as have large heads and short necks. For the immediate and many of the exciting causes of this complaint, see Apoplexy, Medicine Index.\n\nA fit of apoplexy is often produced in an animal that is predisposed to it, by some sudden or violent exertion, such as drawing a heavy load, &c.\n\nThe means of preventing apoplexy when an attack of it is threatened, have been already explained (in No. 317, 318, and 427.) When a fit of apoplexy takes place, if the animal is full of blood, which generally happens, it will be proper to bleed, from the temporal artery, or jugular vein, to an extent proportioned to the state of the animal. If the animal appears weak, bleeding should not be attempted; but the determination of blood to the head may be effectually checked by making pressure upon the carotid artery, taking care at the same time, not to include the jugular veins. Mr Coleman recommends tying up the carotid arteries in dangerous cases of flaggers, and Mr Feron says, that he has often repeated this experiment with success. The bowels should be emptied in the usual manner, as soon as possible; and a strong stimulating clyster should be injected. When the animal comes to himself, if fat and plethoric, he should have a good strong purgative ball, and afterwards some gentle diuretic medicines. He should be kept quiet for some hours after the fit; but when the physic has properly wrought, he should have gentle exercise, which must be gradually increased, according as he is able to bear it; and great care should be taken to keep the bowels open, and to prevent too great an accumulation of blood.\n\n2. Palsy. Paralysis. Thortor-ill, (in sheep.)\n\nThe inferior animals sometimes become paralytic, and we have seen that a palsy in the hind legs is one of the principal symptoms of the distemper in dogs. A paralytic disorder is not uncommon among sheep, and is called by shepherds the thortor-ill. It sometimes arises from their having eaten some poisonous or narcotic plants, but is very generally the effect of great weaknesses produced by want of proper nourishment. The best remedy seems to be white vitriol, given three times a day; and the food should be of the most wholesome and nourishing kind.\n\nWe had intended in this chapter to consider pretty much at large, the various cases of suspended animation, or apathy, such as drowsiness, hanging, suffocation from fixed air or other noxious gases, and torpor from cold; but this article has already swelled to an unexpected length, and we have yet much important matter on our hands. We must therefore refer our veterinary readers to the article Medicine; as the means to be there directed for restoring suspended animation in man will, with some little modification, apply to similar cases in the domestic animals.\n\nChap. IV. Of Spasmodic Diseases.\n\n1. Locked-Jaw. Tetanus. Stag-evil. Mal de Cerf.\n\nIt has been remarked in No. 10. that horses are extremely subject to the locked-jaw, which proves one of the most obstinate and fatal diseases by which they are affected. It seems also occasionally to appear among cattle, but it occurs to them much less frequently than to horses. We do not know that any writer has described this disease in the horse better than Mr Gibbon, whose description we shall therefore copy, though it is expressed in rather an uncouth style.\n\n\"As soon as a horse is seized in this manner, his head is raised with his nose towards his neck, his ears pricked up, and his tail cocked, looking with an eagerness, as an hungry horse when hay is put down to him, or like an high-spirited one, when upon his mettle; in so much that those who are strangers to such things, when they see a horse stand in this manner, will scarce believe anything of consequence ails him; and I have seen such persons greatly surprised when they have been told of the danger. But they are soon convinced, when they see other symptoms come on apace; that his neck grows...\"\ngrows stiff, cramped, and almost immovable; and if a horse in this condition lives a few days, several knots and ganglions will rise on the tendinous parts thereof; and all the muscles both before and behind, will be so pulled and cramped and stretched, that he looks as if he was nailed to the pavement, with his legs stiff, wide, and straddling; his skin so tight on all parts of his body, that it is almost impossible to move it; and if trial be made to make him walk, he is ready to fall at every step, unless he be carefully supported; his eyes are so fixed with the inaction of the muscles, as gives him a deadness in his looks. He snorts and sneezes often, pants continually with shortness of breath; and this symptom increases till he drops down dead, which generally happens in a few days, unless some very sudden and effectual turn can be given to the distemper.\"\n\nThis disease is generally primary or idiopathic; but it is sometimes symptomatic. The pulse is not always much affected; there is seldom any fever, and the internal functions are seldom impaired till towards the latter stages of the disease.\n\nWe have not many accounts of the appearances that have been discovered on dissecting horses which have died of this disease. In two dissections by M. Huzard, the bowels within the belly, especially the stomach and large intestines, were considerably inflamed; the liver was full of black and fluid blood, and in one case a considerable quantity of blood had escaped into the cavity of the belly; the substance of the liver was very tender, as if it were decomposed or rotten. The other viscera of the belly, and the heart and lungs, were in their natural state. On opening the head, considerable marks of inflammation appeared in the brain, the choroid plexus was distended with blood, and in one case the maxillary and frontal sinuses of the right side were full of black blood; the dura mater was inflamed, and its vessels, as well as those of the brain, were turgid with blood; the ventricles of the brain contained a quantity of serous fluid. In one of the cases the inflammation had extended even to the periosteum on the right side, which was much redder than that on the left.\n\nIt is difficult to say whether the disease depended on an inflammatory affection of the brain, or whether this was the consequence of the violent spasmodic contraction of the muscles during the height of the disease; but we are inclined to think the latter was the case.\n\nInfluences of recovery from this disease in horses are very rare; we shall presently give one from Mr Gibbon, which is rather remarkable. A cautious opinion ought therefore to be given in every case of locked-jaw.\n\nThis affection may be produced by various causes, particularly from wounds, where the nerve is partially divided; from cold, when the body is in a profuse sweat. It may arise also from internal irritation, as from worms, which, in Mr Gibbon's opinion, are a very common cause of it. Probably it more frequently proceeds from wounds, as a puncture in the foot or any other part; and it has certainly often been brought on by the barbarous operations of docking and nicking. There seems no doubt that the brain is the principal seat of the affection.\n\nIn the treatment of locked-jaw, it is necessary to use some vigorous measures as early as possible; but unhappily no method hitherto adopted has proved successful, even in a few cases. Opium, aconite, heliobore, &c., have been tried in the veterinary college in very large doses, but without any beneficial effects. From considering it as a disease of the brain, trepanning has been used, with the view of making pressure on the brain, and this has sometimes appeared to take off the spasm of the muscles; but as soon as the pressure was removed, the spasms returned with nearly equal violence. An infusion of tobacco, to the amount of two pounds, has been given by Mr Coleman, but the symptoms appeared to be aggravated. Mr Feron recommends bleeding, and immerging the animal in a warm bath at 95\u00b0 of Fahrenheit, so as to keep the whole body covered with the water for two or three hours, which he has known to be successful; but the horse must afterwards be clothed and kept very warm. The most probable means to relieve the animal seem to be giving opium in large doses by way of clyster, frequently repeated, and rubbing the whole body frequently with some stimulating liniment, such as oil of turpentine and tincture of cantharides. Mr Blaine recommends a clyster composed of a strong decoction of poppy heads, with two ounces of camphor dissolved in brandy; or if this be thought too expensive, one with two ounces of spirit of hartshorn and four ounces of oil of turpentine, mixed with two or three yolks of eggs, and a pint of ale. The cold bath is found one of the most effectual remedies in the human body, and we should conceive that it is more likely than any other means to do good in the horse; but it will be necessary to rub him as dry as possible after throwing the water over him.\n\nIf it is ascertained that the disease proceeds from a punctured or lacerated wound, it will be proper immediately to secure the wounded part, so as, if possible, completely to divide the affected nerve, as in some cases where this has been done, the spasms have been removed. It must be confessed, however, that even this has frequently failed. If it has proceeded from a punctured wound in the foot, Mr Blaine thinks it advisable to take up the nerves of that foot on each side; for though this might occasion temporary lameness, yet, if the horse were favored, this might be removed in a few weeks.\n\nThe following case related by Mr Gibbon, in his last work on the diseases of horses, is very instructive; even though it should be contended that the cure was effected by nature, and not by Mr Gibbon's remedies.\n\nA young troop horse was suddenly seized with this kind of convulsion, which was first discovered as he was leading out to water, at the afternoon's watering time. \"I happened,\" says Mr Gibbon, \"to be then present, and perceived him come reeling along with his nose turned out, his eyes fixed and immovable, with all the other signs that usually attend this fatal distemper; and when he came to the trough he could not reach the water because of the cramp and stiffness of his neck; and when it was held to him in a pail, could not drink, though he shewed an eagerness for it; his mouth being shut up so close, that it was scarce possible to put a knife between his teeth. When we found it impossible to administer any kind of medicine, till by rubbing his cheeks, jaws, and temples, and his whole neck, for a considerable time, we made a shift, with great difficulty, to thrust down part of a calomel ball, on the end of a small stick, and then to put into his nostrils, a very small portion of a strong cephalic drink, thinking by that means...\"\nto convey the ball downwards into his stomach, which however had but little effect, any farther than this, that he had not such sudden fits and agitations as I have seen in others in like circumstances, but continued more quiet; neither did his fever increase, as usually happens when the distemper is gaining ground; but all this while his mouth continued to much fluid, that he could neither eat nor drink for three weeks; only by continually rubbing his jaws and neck, he would sometimes make a shift to suck a handful of scalded bran, or sometimes a little oat-meal, moistened with warm water; but in so small a quantity, that it is possible he might have starved, if other methods had not been taken to keep him alive.\n\n\"I have often observed, that the forcing the jaws open by violent means, puts a horse into such agonies, that it rather increases than abates the symptoms; and therefore I contrived to give him both food and physic by the fundament, through a pipe fourteen inches long, by which he seemed to receive great benefit; for we could perceive the symptoms to abate daily. His flanks grew more quiet, he stood more still, and free from sudden fits and startings; all which symptoms are usual in the continuance and increase of the distemper. The clysters were contrived in the following manner.\n\n\"Rue, pennyroyal, and chamomile flowers, of each a handful; savin and box, of each a handful; garlic, an ounce; caftor and affaefctida, of each half an ounce.\n\n\"In making this clyster, the herbs are to be boiled first, in two quarts of water, in a covered vessel, the space of ten or fifteen minutes, with the caftor and affaefctida cut in small pieces, and tied in a rag; not only to save the caftor from waste, but that it may be squeezed into several clysters. Then the garlic to be added, and continued, close covered, over the fire the space of ten minutes longer; after this the liquor to be poured off into a pan, or any other convenient vessel; then add of linseed oil and treacle, of each four ounces, with half an ounce of unrectified oil of amber; the treacle and the oils are to be mixed with the decoction, when it is put into the bag.\n\n\"This clyster was repeated once a-day for a fortnight; and by way of diet, was given every day three or four quarts of milk, boiled with oat meal and water, a bag with a long pipe being left in the stable for that purpose. He retained every thing that was administered that way, which he generally fucked up of himself without force. This perhaps was in some measure owing to the nature of this universal convulsion which causes such irregular motions in the midriff and muscles of respiration, as in some measure inverts the natural motion of the guts; and for the same reason horses in this condition seldom dung, but stale often; and when they dung, it drops from them in a manner insensibly, and often no more than one or two balls at a time; and therefore as this horse could receive little or no sustenance by the mouth, I was determined to make trial how far he might receive nourishment by way of injection backwards; whether a thin diluted food thrown into the straight gut, and from thence over into the small guts, by the help of a long pipe, might not find a passage into the blood through the lacteals, especially the experiments of this kind made on the human body, both in administering food and physic, particularly in giving the bark, by way of clyster, in agues and intermitting fevers, which has been found successful where the stomach was not able to bear its austerity. It was upon this footing that I treated him in the manner I have described, which I imagined was not altogether without effect; for he scarce ate in three weeks what was sufficient to sustain him one day; so that it was impossible for him to have lived, had he not been supported by what was thrown into his bowels; and though by this means he lost his flesh very sensibly, yet he still retained a good deal of vigour and vivacity. He had two men constantly to look after him, and these relieved by others, who had orders to rub his whole body often, which greatly helped to relax his skin, and remove the crampings of his muscles; and though he had not for the first fortnight recovered the use of his jaws, yet we observed him daily to move with less stiffness, and often to lick in his manger, as if he craved after food. He also breathed with less difficulty, and had several other good signs. This encouraged me to try another experiment with opium, from the known quality of that drug in relaxing the animal fibres; which I therefore thought might be of service to remove the contractions of the muscles about his mouth and jaws, which all this while continued in some measure obstinate, and without some powerful relief, might prove fatal, even though the original cause was in a great measure taken away; therefore I caused an ounce of crude opium to be dissolved in one of his clysters, which was followed with these circumstances, that the horse soon lay down, began to point his ears backwards and forwards, and could move his neck pretty freely, and his mouth was so far at liberty, that he took his drink with little or no difficulty, and could eat hay and bran sufficient to sustain him. He likewise moved his whole body so readily, that we could walk him an hour every day; and that I might follow what I imagined had been so successfully begun by the opiate clyster, I ordered him some days after an ounce of the common Matthew's pill, which contains about two drachms of opium, and the same quantity of affaefctida, made into a ball, which was given at his mouth, and washed down with a hornful of gruel, which was done with great ease, his mouth being grown pretty pliable. This ball being once more repeated, he recovered daily, being continued for some time in the use of the drinks, which were now administered only twice a-week, with a good rubbing; and as soon as he began to recover his flesh, he was gently purged. By these means he was perfectly cured, without any other ill effect than a blemish upon one eye, caused by the violent and strong contraction of the muscles during the convulsions, which indeed were as bad as any I ever saw, even where they proved the most fatal.\"\n\nWe have related the above case thus particularly, in the author's own words, because we have scarcely ever seen a case of locked-jaw in horses so well described, both as to its progress and treatment. Whatever might have been the cause that produced the complaint in this horse, it was evident that it did not depend upon any congestion of blood in the head, and Gibbon judged very properly in not employing bleeding, purging, and rowels, which appear to have been the indiscriminate practice of farriers in his time; and which might be very proper where the convulsions proceed originally\nDiseases from the head. Gibson says, that he has seen the farriers in such cases put a rowel on each side of the neck, one on the belly, one on the forehead, and one on each side. It appears, however, that this practice meets with but little success, as in this complaint the skin is drawn too tight in all parts that the rowels seldom suppurate kindly, but very commonly produce a mortification, and thus increase the animal's distress.\n\n2. Epilepsy, or Falling-sickness. Convulsions.\n\nWe have already stated our opinion, that several cases that are commonly called flaggers are really instances of epilepsy, and we have no doubt that several strange convulsive disorders that are described as affecting domestic animals may be referred to the same head. Of this kind we consider the skipping complaint among lambs described by Mr Lawrence: \"I remember in former days, (says he), on the borders of Suffolk, several flocks of lambs were seized with an uncommon malady, leaping and jumping about the fold-yard in a strange manner; and a dung-heap being raised to the level of the eaves of a low tiled barn, a number of the lambs ran skipping up to the top of the roof, as though they had been possessed by more devils than Mary Magdalen, or even the nuns of Loudun. The whole parish wisely concluded they were bewitched, and a wretched and aged pauper became the object of their suspicions and their deadly hatred. I do not precisely recollect, but I fear the brutal, senseless, and infernal supposed preventive of witchcraft was recourse to, burning one of the poor animals alive.\" We should be disposed to account for so many animals being seized with it at once, on the principle of imitation, just as we have seen a number of children at school fall into fits from seeing one of their number affected with epilepsy. The treatment of this complaint must be regulated by the state of the body at the time. If this is plethoric, bleeding, purging, and low diet, will be necessary; if it is weak, a strengthening plan must be adopted.\n\n3. Canine Madness. Hydrophobia. Rabies Canina. La Rage, Fr.\n\nOf this most dreadful malady, the nature of which is so little understood, and of which the cure still remains a desideratum in medicine, the accounts hitherto given are very imperfect.\n\nOur principal object should certainly be to ascertain the origin and progress of the symptoms, as they appear in the dog, in whom the disease appears to originate. The account of these symptoms, as given by different authors, is exceedingly contradictory. The best account that we have seen is that of Meynell of Quorndon in the county of Leicestershire, and which is published by Dr Arnold in his account of a case of hydrophobia. Before we give Mr Meynell's view of the symptoms, we shall quote a passage from that part of Mr Lawrence's treatise on horses, in which he speaks of canine madness. The passage is as follows: \"The diagnostics of canine madness are, hunger and thirst, without power to eat or drink; trembling, eyes fierce and flaming, hanging of the ears and tail, which is bent inwards; lolling of the tongue, foaming, barking of the dog at his own shadow; panting, running a straight and headless course against anything in his way, biting with violence; other dogs fly him by instinct.\"\n\nBy comparing the above diagnostics with the following account of Mr Meynell's, it will be seen how little dependence is to be placed on the description of those who have not written from their own actual observation. We doubt not that Mr Lawrence derives his account from what he conceived to be the best information, and he is therefore not accountable for his errors.\n\nAccording to Mr Meynell, the first symptom of canine madness in dogs appears to be a failure of appetite in a small degree, that is, the dog does not eat count of his usual food with his usual eagerness, though, if better food be offered him, he may eat it greedily. A disposition to quarrel with other dogs comes on early in the disease. A total loss of appetite generally succeeds, though dogs sometimes eat and lap water the day before their death, which generally happens between seven and ten days after the first symptoms have appeared. A mad dog will not cry out on being struck, or show any sign of fear on being threatened; though he will, very late in the disease, appear sensible of kind treatment. A mad dog, in the height of the disorder, has a disposition to bite all other dogs, animals, or men. When not provoked, he usually attacks only such as come in his way; but having no fear, it is peculiarly dangerous to strike at or provoke him.\n\nMad dogs appear to be capable of communicating the infection early in the disorder, and as soon as they begin to quarrel with and bite other dogs.\n\nThe eyes of mad dogs do not look red or fierce, but dull, and have a peculiar appearance, which is easily distinguished by such as have been used to observe it, but which is not easy to be described.\n\nMad dogs never bark, but occasionally utter a most dismal and plaintive howl, expressive of extreme distress, and which they who have once heard can never forget. So that dogs may be known to be going mad without being seen, when only this dismal howl is heard from the kennel.\n\nMad dogs do not foam or froth at the mouth, but their lips and tongue appear dry and foul or slimy.\n\nMad dogs are generally sufficiently sensible to know those to whom they have been accustomed.\n\nMr Meynell is confident that dread of water is not a symptom of this disease in dogs.\n\nThough mad dogs generally refuse both food and drink, in the latter stage of the disorder, yet they never show any abhorrence or dread of water, will pass through it without difficulty, and lap it eagerly to the last. But it is remarkable, that though they will lap water for a long time, and eagerly, and do not seem to experience any uneasiness from it, yet they do not appear to swallow a single drop of it; for however long they may continue lapping it, no diminution of quantity can be perceived.\n\nHe has never known a dog shew symptoms of the disease in less time after the bite than ten days; and he has known many instances of dogs having died mad as late as eight months after the bite. The symptoms generally appear between three and eight weeks after the bite.\n\nA dog had been bitten, and confined by accident,\nand not from any suspicion of danger, for a whole year, so as to have no communication with any other dog all the time; and went mad at the end of that period.\n\nMr Meynell makes the following additional observations. \"I am persuaded that the disorder never originates from hot weather, putrid provisions, or from any other cause but the bite. For however dogs may have been confined, however fed, or whatever may have been the heat of the season, I never knew the disorder commence, without being able to trace it to that cause; and it was never introduced into the kennel but by the bite of a mad dog. I do not say that I am certain that the disorder never originated from any cause except the bite; but I say that I never knew a dog go mad that I had no reason to believe had been bitten.\n\n\"Some dogs, in the last stage of the disorder, have a locked jaw.\n\n\"I do not recollect ever to have heard a dog bark after I have perceived symptoms of madness upon him.\n\n\"I consider an unusual disposition to quarrel with other dogs as a certain sign of beginning madness; and it is the only one I know.\n\n\"I believe the disorder always comes on so gradually that mischief may be prevented by proper care.\n\n\"I believe after symptoms have ever appeared, they never go entirely off; and that the disease, though sometimes very slow in its progress, always terminates in death.\n\n\"Dogs known to have been bitten frequently escape, but I believe not near so frequently as men.\n\n\"Almost all the mad dogs that I have seen have been confined.\n\n\"The hair of a mad dog do not stand erect more than those of other dogs.\n\n\"I do not know that there is anything remarkable in the manner of a mad dog's carrying his head or his tail.\n\n\"I do not know that there is anything fierce in the appearance of the eyes of a mad dog. I believe I should know a mad dog to be mad from the appearance of his eyes, but I cannot describe this appearance.\n\n\"I do not know that a dog in the beginning of this disorder, is disposed to sneak away growling, or to flun the society of other dogs; but if I observed any thing particular in the manner of a dog, I should certainly confine him.\n\n\"I do not believe that dogs are more afraid of a mad dog than they are of any other dog that seems disposed to attack them.\"\n\n(Mr Daniel was witness to an instance of this innate dread of a mad dog in other dogs, at Bradwell in Essex, where he was hunting with the reverend H. Bate Dudley. Mr Dudley walked his hounds to the water to swim them; he had himself swam over to an island about a hundred yards from the shore, and most of the hounds had followed him, but some of them could not be compelled to do so. At this juncture an alarm of a mad dog was given, who had been pursued many miles, and done variety of mischief in his progress; he seized one of the hounds that would not go into the water, and the remainder to the number of seven or eight immediately upon his approach to them, took to the water and swam across to those in the island.*)\n\n\"There are two kinds of madness, both of which I have known to originate from the bite of the same dog. Among houndsmen, one is known by the name of raging the other by that of dumb madness. In dumb madness, the nether jaw drops, and fixes; the tongue hangs out of the mouth, and slaver drops from it. In raging madness, I believe the mouth is shut, except when the dog snaps or howls, and that no moisture drops from it.\"*\n\nThe following facts and observations upon the consequences of the madness among Earl Fitzwilliam's hounds, perhaps mark the attack and symptoms of this disorder more accurately than any other description of a similar accident.\n\nIn the night of the 8th of June 1791, the man who slept in the kennel was unusually disturbed by the hounds fighting; he got up to quiet them several times, and always found the same hound quarrelling. Noticing the riotous behaviour of this particular hound, and at the same time an appearance of stupidity in him, he was induced to suppose that he was going mad, and accordingly confined him in a place by himself, after which the pack was quiet the remainder of the night. When the huntsman came to the kennel in the morning, he was told what passed, and the supposed mad hound thrown to him; his appearance was suspicious; some meat was given to him, part of which he ate, although there was an apparent difficulty in swallowing. Two days passed in suspense; but at the end of the third, his disorder was confirmed; and at the end of the fifth day he died mad. Immediate preparations were made for confining 42 couple of hounds separately, until the month of September, which was rigidly adhered to. By this means, Mr Hopkinson, a medical gentleman of Peterborough had an opportunity wherein he very skilfully and exactly minutely the symptoms and progress of this disease.\n\nSix hounds went mad in the following order.\n\n| No | Attacked       | Date          |\n|----|---------------|---------------|\n| 1  | July 1st      |               |\n| 2  | August 3rd    |               |\n| 3  | September 3rd  |               |\n| 4  | Ditto 4th     |               |\n| 5  | November 10th  |               |\n| 6  | December 8th   |               |\n\nThe hounds were first taken from their chains in September, and exercised for about half an hour together, not more than four or five couple at a time, and not trusted out of the sight of the attendant. When this exercise was over, they were again confined separately, and fed at separate troughs. In the beginning of October, they were taken out ten couple at a time; at the latter end of that month, twenty couple; still observing the same caution with respect to separate confinement after they returned from exercise. In the beginning of November they were hunted, but were chained up, as at first, after hunting, until the third week of that month, when they were let loose in different apartments of one, two, three, four, and five couple together. This regulation was continued till the month of June 1792, as the huntsman, who has had much experience in this disease did not deem them safe under a year.\n\nThe only remedy employed was mercurial ointment; and all the hounds, except the bitches that were in whelp,\nwhelp, underwent two frictions, so as to produce in some of them a violent salivation.\n\nMr Hopkinfon remarks, that from the above statement it seems that the disorder is as virulent, as to the power of inoculation (by which process it is always communicated) at its commencement, as at the advanced stage of it; for all the six dogs that went mad were probably infected on the 8th of June, within a few hours of each other.\n\nIt is a common opinion, that when a dog is bitten by one that is mad, a few weeks confinement, tea-bathing, or the popular nostrums, are either of them sufficient to prevent his taking the disease, and from spreading its mischievous effects; but in this case, there was a fair opportunity of proving that there is no security after six months, perhaps not after twelve; that mercury has no certain power to prevent it; and it appears that the huntman had repeatedly employed all the popular remedies, without any effect whatever. He had also observed nearly the same progress of the disease in several packs of hounds, where no expense had been spared, for every medicine in use, tea-bathing &c. In the present instance, there was this remarkable difference, that no internal medicine had been given, and the huntman never knew fewer hounds attacked with the disease.\n\nThe result of the huntman's experience in the preventive plan is therefore in favour of a separate confinement; for whenever he had depended on medicine, and not on the above plan of treatment, the disease had made dreadful havoc.\n\nThere is reason to suppose that the hound which first went mad, was not bitten by any other dog, but that it was in him a spontaneous disease. The whole pack were examined very attentively, and bites found upon four couple, one of which was seen fighting with the mad hound twice; he underwent a longer confinement than the rest: however, none of them were attacked by the disease, and it is singular that no bites were discovered upon the six hounds that went mad. The infection taking place or not, is therefore perhaps the result of chance; yet, although no bites were perceived upon the hounds which went mad, there is every ground to conclude they were bitten, but that the wounds being small, were concealed by the hair. Mr Daniel suggests, that most probably there were bites within side of the lips, or jaws, where the venomous saliva might be more fatally and quickly absorbed into the habit, than where the teeth had to penetrate through the thick outer skin of the dog.\n\nMr Hopkinfon continues his remarks with respect to the symptoms of madness in dogs, and states that those which distinguish the attack of the hydrophobia, are in general a loathing of food, although this is not universal, as they will sometimes eat solid food, but refuse liquid. The first and only symptom that No. 3, had of the disease, was eating his own excrement when food stood by him; the feeder knowing this to be contrary to what the dog would do if he were well, he immediately confined him. For a day or two he was in some doubt whether his suspicions were well founded; but he proved right, for the dog died raving mad upon the fifth day.\n\nAt the commencement of the disorder, the mad dog has a particular tendency (if loose) to lick and smell the penis and fundament of another dog; this should be looked upon as a very suspicious symptom. The huntman speaks of this as an almost never failing one.\n\nThere seems for the first two or three days, to be intervals of rest; and during that time they usually recognize their master, their eyes look clear and well, their tongues moist, and of the proper colour; but if a dog is loose at this time, he will in general bite everything he meets with. He will sometimes, during this stage of the disease, leave his home for several hours, spread his disorder by biting men and beasts, and return home again. The mad dog, when confined, seldom survives the fifth day from the first attack; if suffered to run about, there is reason to believe his death is hastened by a day or two. At the end of the third or fourth day, his appearance is much altered, his eyes are sunk, his tongue black and dry, he makes horrid howlings, and seems much disturbed; indeed the concluding scene is dreadful to witness. In the first stage of the canine madness, it is difficult for a person not conversant with the disposition of dogs in general, and of the mad dog in particular, to ascertain whether the dog is really mad or not; even Lord Fitzwilliam's huntman was doubtful for a day or two respecting the hound mentioned in this account, as being the first attacked with the disease; however, in the advanced stage of it, no one can be mistaken.\n\nIt is the generally received opinion, that mad dogs will not take the water; but in the summer of 1791, there occurred in the neighbourhood of Peterborough, two instances of mad dogs, when closely pursued, swimming a large navigable river. A doubt might have arisen, as to their being mad, but that two hogs went mad from the bite of one, and the other was pursued for many miles by Lord Fitzwilliam's huntman, who, from his experience in the disease, was not likely to be mistaken. Both Rural dogs completely swam the river.*\n\nOf all the remedies that have been employed for the cure of this dreadful disorder, none seems to likely to be successful as the cold bath. This remedy was recommended about 200 years ago by the Seigneur d'Elparron, in his \"Fauconnerie,\" and he gives a curious instance of its success in the cure of a mad dog. \"I will relate, (says he) what happened to a gentleman of my acquaintance. He discovered that some of his dogs had been bitten by a mad dog; and after some time, several of them betrayed symptoms of the disease. These he ordered to be killed; but it happened that one which was a great favourite was seized, and he desired his servant to throw him into the river. By chance, the dog in coming up from the bottom, got entangled in the roots of a tree by the cord with which he had been tied, but in such a manner that his nose just remained above the water. In this situation he remained for three days, at the end of which period he got loose and returned to the house, to the great astonishment of his master; and here I afterwards saw him, as cheerful and healthy as before. I have no doubt (continues d'Elparron) that if mad dogs could be plunged into water without danger of their biting, they would all recover; and I believe that if the same practice were pursued with men, which might easily be done, many an unfortunate wretch might be saved. The danger of being bitten might be prevented by first putting a muzzle on the animal, and he might then be retained.\"\ntained in the water, as long as may be judged prudent or necessary.\"\n\nAnother writer, Defouilloux, who published a work on hunting in 1583, recommends plunging into salt-water such dogs as have been bitten, for the purpose of preserving them from the effects of the disease.\n\nAs the effect of remedies when the complaint once appears is so uncertain, it should be our principal object to use all the preventive means in our power. When, therefore, it is discovered that an animal has been bitten by one that is mad, the wounded part should immediately be cut out, where this can be done with safety, or at least should be deeply scarified to the very bottom of the bite. The wound should then be repeatedly washed with soap and water, or with a solution of soda poured upon it in a stream from a considerable height; and afterwards the wound should be seared to the bottom with a hot iron; or where this cannot conveniently be done, a quantity of aquafortis, or oil of vitriol, should be poured into it, so as to destroy all the remains of the virus or poison. If the part bitten be the ear, it should be cut off and seared. After these means, it will be proper to plunge the animal once a day into cold water, or where convenient into the sea; and he should be strictly watched, that if these means should have proved unsuccessful, the earliest appearance of the disease may be perceived.\n\nDr Arnold, to whom we are indebted for Mr Meynell's account of the symptoms of madness in dogs, gives the following advice with respect to the method of treating a dog that is suspected of being mad.\n\n\"Though every dog that is bitten does not receive the disorder, yet, as the time of its appearance after the bite is so very uncertain, and as a great proportion of those that are bitten do actually receive it, and as there is no criterion by which we can ascertain whether a dog has or has not received the infection, but the breaking out of the disorder, it is earnestly to be wished, that all owners of dogs would immediately destroy, or secure for a great length of time, every dog known, or but suspected, to have been bitten by a mad dog.\n\n\"It is also earnestly to be wished, that all persons possessing dogs would immediately tie up or destroy such of their dogs, whether known to be bitten or not, as shall begin to be disordered in any way, of which the nature and cause is not perfectly obvious; and especially if there be the smallest reason to suspect that the dog was bitten, and that the disorder is really an incipient madness.\n\n\"It is still more to be wished that they would immediately destroy all dogs known to be in any stage of madness, if it be at the same time known that they have not yet bitten any other animal, and particularly no person whatsoever; and that no dog that has bitten any animal or person be destroyed as a mad dog if it can be avoided, but that every dog be secured and tied up, that it may be certainly known whether he be mad or not. If he has the symptoms of confirmed madness, they will plainly discover themselves, and he will die in ten days and less; if he is not, he may be safely enlarged in the space of a fortnight, and the person bitten will be freed from the most distressing apprehensions.\"\n\nBefore we dismiss the subject of canine madness, it will be expected that we should take some notice of the operation of worming dogs, so celebrated among huntmen and breeders of dogs, as a supposed preventive of this dreadful malady. This operation is as old as the days of Pliny, and has ever since been more or less esteemed among the vulgar. But neither the operation itself, nor its effect, seem to have been well understood. The idea of a worm being lodged in the tongue of the puppy, the extraction of which is to prevent the animal from going mad, is truly ridiculous; and such has been deservedly laughed at by sensible people in all ages. But though it is neither a worm that is extracted, nor is the extraction a preventive of madness, it seems, however, pretty well ascertained, that the performing of this operation is productive of considerable advantage, in preventing the dog from doing mischief, even though he should run mad. It seems, that in dogs who have been wormed, and are afterwards seized with hydrophobia, the tongue swells to such a degree as to prevent the animal from closing his jaws upon the object which he attempts to bite. The following observations of a late ingenious and entertaining writer on the subject are entitled to much attention.\n\nVery strong proofs have been adduced of its utility; nor is it natural to imagine, that so easy and effective an operation would have been omitted, had no more virtue been attributed to it than it really possesses; and, wherein it failed, the absolute prevention of madness was said to be the consequence; whereas the fact was and is, that taking out the worm hath nothing to do with annihilating the disorder, although it will most certainly hinder the dog, seized with it, from doing any hurt to man or beast. A late author affirms, he had three dogs that were wormed, bit by mad dogs at three several periods, yet, notwithstanding they all died mad, they did not bite to do any mischief, that being determined to make a full experiment, he shut one of the dogs up in a kennel, and put to him a dog he did not value; the mad dog often run at the other to bite him, but his tongue so swelled, that he could not make his teeth meet. The dog was kept in the kennel until the mad one died, and was purposely preserved for two years afterwards, to note the effect, but he never ailed anything; although no remedies were applied to check any infection that might have been received from the contact of the mad dog.\n\nMr Daniel has had various opportunities of proving the usefulness of worming, and infers three of the most striking instances, under the hope of inducing its general practice.\n\nA terrier bitch went mad that was kept in the kennel with 40 couple of hounds: not a single one was bitten, nor was the feen to offer to bite. The bitch being of peculiar fort, every attention was paid to her, and the gradations of the disease (which were extremely rapid) minutely noted. The hydrophobia was fast approaching before she was separated from the hounds, and she died the second day after. At first warm milk was placed before her, which she attempted to lap, but the throat refused its functions; from this period she never tried to eat or drink, seldom rose up, or even moved; the tongue swelled very much, and long before her death the jaws were distended by it.\n\nA spaniel was observed to be seized by a strange dog, and was bit in the lip; the servant who ran up to\nDiseases, part them, narrowly escaped, as the dog twice flew at him; a few minutes after the dog had quitted the yard, the people who had pursued gave notice of the dog's madness, who had made terrible havoc in a course of ten miles from whence he had set off. The spaniel was a great favourite, had medicine applied, and every precaution taken; upon the fourteenth day he appeared to loathe his food, and his eyes looked unusually heavy; the day following he endeavoured to lap milk, but could fowllow none; from that time the tongue began to fwell, he moved himself but seldom, and on the third day he died. For many hours previous to his death, the tongue was so enlarged, that the fangs or canine teeth could not meet each other by upwards of an inch.\n\nThe hounds were some years after parted with, and were sold in lots. A madness broke out in the kennel of the gentleman who purchased many of them; and although several of these hounds were bitten and went mad, only one of them ever attempted to bite, and that was a hound from the duke of Portland's, who, in the operation of worming, had the worm broke by his struggling, and was so troublesome that one half of it was suffered to remain; the others all died with symptoms similar to the terrier and spaniel, viz. a violent swelling of the tongue, and a stupor rendering them nearly motionless, and both which symptoms seemed to increase with the disease.\n\nThe idea that worming prevents a dog from receiving the infection when bitten should be exploded; but the foregoing facts show how far it may be recommended for the prevention of a malady horrid in its effects where a human being is concerned, and which to the sportsman and the farmer is attended with such dangerous and expensive consequences.\n\nWe cannot pretend to say, what it is that the worms of dogs take away from the tongue; but we cannot suppose, that Mr Daniel, though he calls it a worm, really believes that it is so. The following are his directions for performing the operation.\n\n\"The worming of whelps should be previous to their being sent out to quarters; this operation is to be performed with a lancet, to slit the thin skin which immediately covers the worm; a small awl is then to be introduced under the centre of the worm, to raise it up; the further end of the worm will with very little force make its appearance, and with a cloth taking hold of that end, the other will be drawn out easily. Care must be taken that the whole of the worm comes away without breaking; and it rarely breaks, unless cut into by the lancet, or wounded by the awl.\"*\n\n4. Colic. Colica. Spasmodic* or Flatulent Colic, Gripes, Bats, Trot, or Gullion. Tranch\u00e9e, Fr.\n\nThis is one of the most painful disorders with which horses are affected; and it seems to occasion them as much distress as inflammation in the bowels, with which it is very commonly confounded by ordinary farriers.\n\nIn this disease the horse expresses his pain, by frequently lying down and rolling on his back, and after having remained a short time in this position, starting up again. The hair is staring, and there are sometimes cold sweats. He frequently makes attempts to flake, looks anxiously at his flanks, and sometimes strikes his belly with his hind feet. There is seldom any fever in this disease; and when it does occur, it is only after the disease has existed for some time. The pulse is seldom affected; but when the pain is very great, it is a little quicker than natural. The belly commonly feels hard and tense. Colic is almost always accompanied with coliciveness, though gripping pains not unfrequently attend severe scouring.\n\nIf the above symptoms are attentively examined, they will commonly serve to distinguish this disease from inflammation of the bowels. It is generally observed, that the pain in colic returns only at intervals, and the extremities are seldom cold. It must not be overlooked however, that when colic continues for a considerable time, it may terminate in inflammation, so that the distinguishing symptoms mentioned here and in No. 497, are to be depended on, only in the early stage of the disease.\n\nCattle are extremely subject to colic; but it is said to be more common in young than in old cattle. The symptoms do not differ from what we have described, only that it is laid, that these animals, when affected with gripes, strike their heads and horns against everything in their way.\n\nColic is easily removed, when the proper remedies are employed, before any symptoms of inflammation make their appearance; but if the remedies be delayed till inflammation takes place, the cure is very precarious.\n\nColic is very commonly the consequence of neglected coliciveness, and by this it is always increased. It may be ascribed to improper food, especially such as is apt to produce flatulence or sourness in the stomach or bowels; by drinking cold water immediately after eating; and by exposure to cold, during violent sweating.\n\nAs it is not always easy to distinguish flatulent colic from inflammation, it is the safest plan to begin the treatment by bleeding, to the extent of three or four English quarts; and the appearance of the blood will generally inform us whether it will be necessary to repeat the operation. See No. 162. The next circumstance to be attended to, is the evacuation of the bowels by back-raking and softening clysters. In general, after this operation, a large quantity of air will be evacuated, and considerable relief will be afforded. After these means have been employed, some stimulating aromatics, such as oil of turpentine, oil of aniseed, essence of peppermint, or some of the other stimulants enumerated in No. 285, and 286, should be given by the mouth; and if these do not procure relief, it will be proper to give a ball containing half an ounce of calomel, and immediately after it, a drench of peppermint water, with five or six drachms of laudanum. The cure will be considerably assisted by rubbing the belly gently with a warm cloth; and the animal should be gently trotted, for a considerable time, while led by the halter. Warm fomentations to the belly have been recommended; but if there is a considerable accumulation of air in the stomach and bowels, these would do harm by increasing the expansion of the air, and thus adding to the animal's distress; for it must be remembered, that a horse cannot easily belch up wind by the mouth; and where there is any obstruction backwards, everything that can increase the expansion...\nexpansion of the confined air, must do harm. On the contrary, every thing that is capable of diminishing the volume of air, may probably relieve the pain. It might be worth while to try how far the application of cold to the belly would be attended with advantage; and this might easily and safely be effected, by bathing the belly with strong spirit of wine, which speedily evaporating, will considerably diminish the temperature of the belly. It will be proper, where the disease continues obstinate, to administer warm softening clysters, every hour or two; as well for the purpose of obviating colic, as for removing the spasmodic contraction of the bowels. We are assured, that where most other means have failed, of procuring relief in flatulent colic, this has been obtained by means of the smoke of tobacco drawn up the fundament. The simplest way of administering this remedy, is to introduce the small end of a tobacco pipe, after having filled the bowl and lighted it; when the smoke will infallibly be drawn up by the action of the horse's bowels.\n\n**Chap. V. Of Dropical Disease.**\n\nOur domestic animals are sometimes affected with dropy; and this may be either diffused through the cellular membrane below the skin; or the water may be contained within one or more of the cavities, as the head, the chest, and the belly.\n\nExternal dropy, or what medical writers call ana-farca, and farriers water farcy, is not common, unless it accompanies a dropical collection within the body. It sometimes affects particular parts, as the legs, the throat, or the lips; and at other times it is diffused over the whole cellular membrane. It is known by the swelling of the part, which is cold, and retains the impression of the finger for some time. The urine is generally more sparing and of a deeper colour than is natural; and the animal appears considerably weak. This disease, when it has proceeded to any considerable height, and when the animal is much debilitated, is not easily removed; but when it is slight, and of no long standing, it will in general yield to remedies.\n\nAll the species of dropy more commonly affect old than young animals; and such as are debilitated by any previous cause, are more subject to it. It is said that horses are more likely to become dropical in spring and autumn when they are moulting.\n\nThe cure of general dropy is to be attempted by the use of diuretic medicines, accompanied with a nourishing diet, gentle exercise, and frequent friction all over the body, especially over those parts where the accumulation of fluid is situated. The action of the diuretics must be assisted by a sufficient quantity of drink; and it will be proper to give the animal some of the more powerful strengthening remedies, such as white vitriol, oak bark, logwood, &c.\n\n1. **Dropy of the Head. Hydrocephalus. Sturdy. Turnfick.**\n\nDropy of the head seldom affects horses or cattle; but a peculiar collection of water in the head is very common among sheep, in whom it is called the Sturdy, or Turnfick. One of the best accounts of this disease that we have seen is that which is given in the second appendix to Mr Findlater's survey of Peebles, which we shall give nearly in the words of the author.\n\nThis disease is peculiarly incident to young sheep, or hogs, of a year or eighteen months old. It consists of a collection of water generally formed upon the external surface of the brain, immediately below the skull; and sometimes, though not often, in the center or ventricles of the brain. When the water forms in the last mentioned parts, we apprehend it is almost universally mortal.\n\nThe disorder is first discovered, by the animal not keeping up with the rest of the flock, and by its appearing dull and stupid. It is afterwards observed to go round in a giddy manner; and at length it appears blind, and the pupil of the eye seems wide and relaxed. It may continue a long time in this situation before it dies; and it is believed that sheep sometimes recover of this disease without any thing being done for them. They are often in good order when they die, as they continue to feed tolerably well, until near the last period. Though some recover, with or without means, perhaps it may be most advisable to kill them early in the disease, provided they be in good order, as this local temper does not affect the goodness of the mutton.\n\nWhen the collection of water is on the outside of the brain, it is often cured by thrusting a sharp wire up the animal's nostrils, until it reaches the water, and opens a passage for it to run off. In other cases, it is cured by an operation which some shepherds perform very dexterously. The water is contained in a bladder, or vehicle, (a hydatid) generally about the size of a walnut. The part of the skull immediately above where it is situated, feels softer than other parts. This the shepherd discovers, by pressing with his thumb and fingers, upon different parts of the fore and upper parts of the skull. The bone here has become thinner, and feels soft; from which he is certain that the watery collection is formed.\n\nAfter the disease has gone on a considerable time, and he judges it ripe for the operation, he raises the scalp, and lays the bone bare to a sufficient breadth, with a sharp knife; he then discovers more accurately the extent of the thin soft part of the bone, and with a strong and sharp-pointed knife, he makes a circular incision in the skull, raises up, and takes out the part. He then sees the clear thin bladder underneath, which he lays hold of with a small hook, or the point of a needle, and gently draws it out; taking all possible care that it be not broken, or the water spilled, which would prove unfavourable to recovery. He finds a considerable hollow in the brain where the bag was situated, over which he brings the flap of skin that was raised, so as to cover it as neatly as possible. Over the whole he applies a plaster of tar, and leaves the rest to nature. This operation frequently proves successful.\n\nMr Findlater remarks, that in Tweeddale, one case in three, where a perforation is made by the pointed wire, or the trepan, usually ends favourably. Of late it has been the custom among the shepherds of that district, to bore into the skull of sheep affected with the sturdy, with a common gimlet; and however rough or apparently dangerous the operation, it seems frequently to prove successful. The perforation is made by boring from the root of the nostril, in an oblique direction.\n2. Water in the Chest. Hydrothorax.\n\nThis complaint appears but seldom in the inferior animals; but it may take place from excessive debility; and according to Mr Blaine, it is sometimes the consequence of inflammation in the lungs. Here however this writer is probably mistaken, and confounds water in the chest with empyema, or a collection of matter within the chest, which is not an uncommon termination of pneumonia.\n\nWhen dropy in the chest does occur, the animal labours under a difficulty of breathing, especially when lying down; and the pulse is feeble, and commonly irregular. The urine is scanty and high coloured. If the collection of water is pretty considerable, it may be perceived by the sound that is produced, when the chest is struck with the hand; but this is often a deceitful sign, and should not be tried till a long time after the animal has drunk; as, for some time after drinking, the water that remains in the stomach will, when the ribs are struck, produce a sound that might lead us to suppose there was water in the chest.\n\nThis complaint commonly proves fatal, both in man and animals, and probably there is no means of cure except by evacuating the water, by an opening into the chest; an operation which is always precarious, and commonly as dangerous as the disease which it is intended to relieve. If it is determined however to try the experiment, the opening should be made between the seventh and eighth rib, near the breast bone, on that side of the chest where the water is supposed to be accumulated. In making the opening, the skin should be drawn tight towards the edge of the seventh rib; when a cut is to be made in the place above directed, with a sharp knife, not cutting too boldly, but rather scratching with the point of the knife, till the skin and the muscles are completely divided. After this, a pipe must be introduced through the opening, and fastened by a bandage round the animal; some soft linen or a piece of sponge being placed over the opening, after as much water as possible has run off, to suck up the remaining moisture, and exclude the air.\n\n3. Water in the Belly. Ascites.\n\nThis is the most common species of dropy, and is known by the general symptoms of dropy that have been described in No. 319. and 320., attended with an unusual swelling of the belly; while the skin is cold, and very tight. When the belly is struck with one hand, while the other is held upon the opposite side, a fluctuation may be perceived, much more distinctly than in the last species.\n\nIt is brought on by the usual causes of dropy that we have already mentioned, and is not an uncommon consequence of jaundice and other chronic disorders. It is not quite so dangerous as dropy in the chest, but it is very apt to return after having been removed.\n\nThe treatment should be begun with diuretics, and now and then a mercurial purge, while the body is strengthened by tonic medicines, nourishing diet, and gentle exercise. If the accumulation of water becomes very great, it may be easily evacuated, by making a puncture into the belly, and introducing a pipe as in the last case. Mr Lawrence has gone into the mistake generally committed, of supposing that little drink should be given in cases of dropy. It is now well ascertained that moderate drinking considerably increases the efficacy of diuretic medicines.\n\nChap. VI. Of Anomalous Diseases.\n\n1. Diabetes. Profuse Staling, or Pissing-evil.\n\nIt sometimes happens, that horses or cattle make a much greater quantity of urine than is natural; so that the quantity evacuated exceeds the quantity of fluid drunk by the animal. Probably this disease occurs more frequently among cattle than among horses, though it is scarcely mentioned by the writers on cattle medicine, and the account that is given of it by veterinary writers is extremely imperfect. Mr Blaine describes the urine, as being five or six times the natural quantity, as milky or watery, and depositing a sediment which has the taste and appearance of sugar. As we have never observed a case of this disease in horses or cattle, we cannot say how far this description of the urine is correct; but if the urine evacuated by these animals in diabetes resembles the human urine in the same disease, it is clear and almost colourless, has the smell and taste of honey, deposits little sediment, but on being evaporated, leaves a thick substance like treacle.\n\nConsiderable thirst accompanies this disease; and when it has continued long, the animal becomes extremely weak and emaciated. The skin is usually dry and harsh, the pulse is small and quick, and the appetite in the early part of the disease is much increased.\n\nThis complaint commonly proves fatal; few instances of a recovery having been observed in man; and we do not know that any successful case in any of the domestic animals is on record.\n\nThe causes of diabetes are very obscure, especially in the inferior animals; it seems to be the consequence of great weakness, and some unusual action of the digestive organs. The various theories that have been given in explanation of this disease, as far as relates to the human body, will be noticed in the article Medicine and if we shall meet with an opportunity of examining the disease in horses or cattle, we will endeavour to give a more accurate account of it, under Veterinary Art.\n\nIn the treatment of diabetes in horses, &c., the method proposed by Dr Rollo for the cure of this disease in man, has been recommended, and we believe adopted, by Mr Coleman; with what success we cannot say. This method consists in making the animal obtain as much as possible from vegetable food; and giving him broth and balls made of flesh, mixed up with paste of wheat flour. He should have as little drink as possible. Astringent remedies are commonly employed in these cases, such as Japan earth, alum, white vitriol, muriate of iron, oak bark. See receipts, No. 29.\n\n2. Black-Quarter, Quarter-Ill, or Black Spald.\n\nThere is a disease that proves very fatal in some districts to calves or cattle of a year to two old, the nature of which is little understood, but it seems nearly allied.\nMr Lawrence considers the disease as appearing under various forms, to which he gives the following names; blood in the legs, or crateuch; blain in the tongue, or overflow of blood; shrinking-in, or rising of the blood; higham, or iron-fricking; joint murrain, or garget; black quarter; quarter-evil; black leg.\n\nWe have given as a synonym the name of black spald, because we consider the disease so called in Scotland, as nearly, if not entirely, the same with the black quarter of the writers on cattle medicine. As we have not seen the disease, we call copy what Mr Lawrence says of it, in his treatise on cattle.\n\n\"All our animals, oxen, sheep, and pigs, I have observed, are subject to sanguineous effusion or overflow of the blood, on being put in a low and weak state, to rich or succulent keep. They very commonly drop on a sudden, and die in the blood, as it is termed; when the carcases putrefy almost immediately, and are totally lost. Pigs which die in this way, have their skins so universally suffused with the blood, that they appear enveloped, or rather shrouded in Morocco leather. In oxen, chiefly young cattle, nature commonly finds a vent for the disease, in an eruption on the leg, quarter, or shoulder, attended with pneumatisis or a collection of air in the cellular membrane, or, as it is commonly termed, between the flesh and the skin; whence the crepitating or crackling noise, which is heard on pressure. Another termination of the disease, is, by a deposition of matter upon the joints, whence the term of joint garget or murrain. I know not whether I am correct in referring the crateuch to this class, which is said, in Scotland, to be a swelling and lameness in the legs; but the old writers particularly mention blood in the legs. Blane or garget in the tongue, attended with inflammation and vehicles or bladders in that part, is said to be a symptom of the disease, and also to arise from heat and fatigue.\n\n\"This disease has swept off great numbers of yearling and two-year-old cattle, and become indeed endemic in certain districts, where any such scourge was unknown, it is said, previously to the introduction of artificial grasses, with the full feeding on which the animals become surfeited: thus the improvident use of good produces evil. The breeders being alarmed at the ravages occasioned by this murrain, which generally carried off the forwardest and best of the cattle, no wonder that the fertile brains of cow-doctors, were put into intestine motion, and that the ideas of the favourite engines, the knife or fire, were whirled uppermost. In effect, some skilful leech introduced the following most extraordinary operation, as a preventive of the disease in question; which I apprehend in the contemplation, either of physiology or common-senseology, could have no better prophylactic or preventive view, than shaving the animal would have; which I beg leave to recommend in the stead, as at least free from cruelty. The ill-starred beast is cast, bound to a stake, all his four legs are cut open from the claws upwards to the height of several inches, in order to find among the tendons and ligaments a strong blood vessel of a bluish colour, which said offending vessel, guilty of the original sin of producing joint murrain, being caught with a crooked needle, is cut away. It is great pity, for the sake of hypothetical uniformity, that the above-aid blue blood-vessel had not been called a worm, since the brains of so many of our cattle folk have been infested with worms from very high antiquity**.\n\nAfter much jocose, but rather coarse ridicule of methods that have been proposed for the cure of this disease, Mr Lawrence thus proceeds. \"Prevention of this malady is the only cure worth notice: because, after the attack, the very nature of the case renders all remedy either uncertain, or of very little profit, even if successful, on account of the expense of time and money. With this view the young cattle must not be pushed too far in condition; and indeed the same precaution may be useful in some degree, with respect to the full aged. A piece of short or inferior keep should be reserved, as a digesting place, in which the cattle may be occasionally turned to empty and exercise themselves. Those observed to advance very fast may be bled monthly for several months: of the efficacy of which practice, however, I have by no means so good an opinion as that of giving medicines which prevent internal obstruction. I am well aware of the difficulty, or rather total impracticability, of such measures with a number of cattle in the field, or I am convinced, that occasional purges, or alternative medicines, would prevent those diseases which seem to take their rise in over repletion and accumulation. Six drachms daily, of equal parts, sulphur and antimony, in fine powder, would be sufficient for a young beast; but to be of any permanent use, it must be continued at least a month; or salt might be of use. Rowelling also might be an efficacious preventative. Keep two rowels or fetons open in each beast during several months.\"\n\nIn the 5th vol. of the Farmers Magazine, is the following communication from a practical farmer re... specfing the cure of this complaint.\n\n\"The first cure for this complaint that I ever saw performed, was on an ox of four and a half years of age. As he was going in the plough, I observed him a little lame in one of the hinder feet. At first I thought he had trampled upon a stone; but as it still grew worse, I soon suspected it was the quarter-ill; the more so, as there was a good year-old died of that disorder three weeks before. By the time he was got to the byre, the crackling between the skin and the flesh was very perceptible on the top joint of the off-side hinder leg. As our blacksmith had some skill among live stock, he was instantly sent for. The first thing he did was to take a little blood from a vein in the neck. He then pulled the skin from the flesh on the side that seemed most pained, still keeping the beast walking as much as possible. He then cauled cold water to be poured in large quantities on the part affected, still rubbing and keeping the skin loose on the affected part. Finding the skin to adhere much to the flesh, he then made three cuts with a penknife, two inches long, into which he rubbed salt and water. In this manner he continued four hours; the one time driving him, then pouring on water, rubbing in salt, and loosening the skin from the flesh. By this time he was not near to cripple, and began to take his food. We were ordered, however, to keep him in motion all night, and in the morning he was well for his food, and never had any more signs of the disease. Since that time I have followed the blacksmith's practice, and have often been successful. Only instead of pouring water on the place, I fasten a rope...\nrope about the beast's head, and take it to a deep pool, causing it to swim up and down, and drive it frequently, giving it an ounce or half an ounce of laudanum, according to the size or age of the beast, but I never did cut the skin. I have good reason to believe that the above method has been the means of curing several of my young cattle, as I never saw any that took that disease, and no means used for their recovery, but died; those I opened, had all the blood collected in the affected quarter. I find it more difficult to cure in the fore quarters than in the hinder, and if it seize the bowels, I hardly think that it will cure by any means.\"\n\n3. On the Rot in Sheep. General or True Rot. Hydropic Rot.\n\nThe name of the rot in sheep, and the ravages that are annually made by it among the flocks of most sheep districts, are familiar to every one; but little pains have been taken to fix the precise meaning of the word, and the particular disease, to denote which it should be exclusively employed. Some of those who appear to have paid particular attention to the subject, have yet followed the example of shepherds and farmers, in confounding under the name of rot, several diseases which differ considerably in their nature, causes, and method of treatment. Two medical men who have lately published; the one, Dr Dickson, on the General Management of Sheep, as connected with practical agriculture; the other, Dr Harrison, on this particular subject of the rot, have still considered it as one disease. In the second appendix to Mr Findlater's Survey of Peebles, and in the fourth number of the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, the distinction of the rot into three different morbid affections, is, however, clearly marked; and there seems no doubt that these three diseases are very similar to consumption, hepatitis or inflammation of the liver, and fever, in the human body. The first of those which we have briefly noticed in No. 490, under the name of pulmonic rot, is distinguished by cough, hectic fever, wasting of flesh, and in many cases by the formation of a watery swelling below the chin. The second, mentioned by the name of hepatic rot in No. 493, is characterized by a degree of fever accompanied by inflammation, and thickening of the outer coat of the liver, or some diseased state of the biliary ducts or pipes, connected with the presence of flukes in the liver, if not sometimes produced by them. The third species has been called general rot, as in this the whole system is more or less affected; true rot, because it appears to be the most common of the three, and to be that to which the name seems more peculiarly applicable; and hydropic rot; because, if the animal is suffered to live, the disease commonly terminates in partial or general dropy. This species is what we are now to consider; and after having given as clear an account of it as we can collect from the descriptions that have been lately published, we shall make a few observations on the causes, treatment, and prevention of the rot in general, endeavouring as much as possible to discriminate between the three varieties.\n\nIt is probable that the first symptoms of the rot have seldom been observed. The earliest marks of the disease of which writers give an account, are, falling off in flesh, and an unusual dullness and heaviness. The flesh feels loose and flabby, especially about the loins; and if pressure is made about the hips, a crackling is sometimes perceptible. It is said that those who are accustomed to handle the ears and legs of sheep, may in the earliest stage of rot discover symptoms of low fever, but probably this is the case only in pulmonic and hepatic rot. Now, or soon afterwards, the countenance looks pale, as do the gums and tongue. On parting the fleece, the skin is found to have lost its fine rosy colour, and is become of a pale red. As the disease advances, the skin appears dappled with yellow and black spots. The eyes have a peculiar appearance; they lose their lustre, and look like the eyes of dead fish. Mr Findlater says, that in Tweeddale, the principal mark of rottenness is taken from the appearance of the eye in the corner next the nose, when the eyeball is turned so as to look away from the nose; as the flesh that adheres to the eyeball below the eyelids, in the corner next the nose, is in a foul sheep of a florid red colour; whereas in a rotten sheep, the flesh is of a dull appearance, and of a yellowish red colour, resembling that of a rotten egg, when the white and the yolk are confounded together. When the disease has continued long, the breath becomes fetid, the gums spongy, the teeth and sometimes the horns loose, the animal is commonly affected with a scouring, the fleece looks torn and ragged, and the wool separates from the skin with a slight pull. Great weakness and emaciation attend the latter stage of the disease; and these continually increase till the animal dies, or till dropy comes on, which always terminates fatally.\n\nThe principal appearance on dissection is presented by the liver, which is found in various states, according to the progress or severity of the disease. When a sheep is killed a few days after contracting the rot, the thin edge of the small lobe of the liver appears of a transparent white or bluish colour, and this colour spreads to a greater extent according to the severity of the complaint. Sometimes it does not extend more than an inch from the edge; at others it occupies a considerable part of the lobe. In severe cases, the whole external coat of the liver is found diseased, commonly assuming an opaque colour intermixed with lines or patches of a darker red. The upper part of the liver is sometimes found speckled like the back of a toad, to which it is said to bear a striking resemblance. Very commonly the liver is found full of hard knots, and sometimes there are ulcers in various parts of it. Are not some of these appearances peculiar to the hepatic rot? When the liver of a sheep affected with the rot is boiled, it loses its consistence, and breaks down into small pieces; whereas it is well known that a sound liver becomes by the same process firm and solid.\n\nWhen sheep have died suddenly in the first stage of this disorder, there may commonly be discovered a quantity of whey-like coloured fluid in the cavity of the belly; and in these cases the outside of the liver is generally covered with a coat of coagulable lymph. This is one of the appearances described by Dr Harrison; and is similar to what is often observed in the belly of animals that have died of dropy in the belly.\n\nIn stating the causes and treatment of general rot, we cannot perhaps do better than copy what is given on this subject in Mr Findlater's survey of Peebles, to which\nwhich we have already been so much obliged. \"It arises from deficient or bad aliment, whether the food itself be bad and scanty, or the animal be incapable of digesting it properly. It is most common from the former cause, want of food; and the disease is much the same with scurvy among the human race. In addition to these causes, whatever tends to depress the spirits, frequently excites, or at least exacerbates, the malady. It is said that soldiers in a garrison have been known to be seized with the scurvy on hearing bad news; and I doubt not but terrifying sheep with dogs, or other means, may produce or aggravate this disease. We may hence see what mischief a fox chase, or any exhibition of that sort, is calculated to bring upon a flock of sheep. The disease is also said to be produced by feeding upon watered grass; and hence shepherds, in many parts of Scotland, are careful to keep off their sheep from the tender grass produced by the occasional overflowing of rivulets. Feeding also in marshy and damp pastures, is known to be a powerful cause of the rot.\n\n\"The only means of cure are, a supply of good and wholesome food, and invigorating the stomach by permitting the animal to feed on those stimulating and aromatic herbs which are agreeable to its taste. It is believed that on dry sweet pastures, where there is a sufficient quantity of furze and broom, juniper, and other shrubs that are palatable to sheep, the rot is seldom heard of. When ground is down for sheep pasture, parsley, thyme, peppermint, and other aromatic herbs, should be sown with the grass seeds, as these plants serve both to prevent and to cure the rot. In addition to these means of cure, every thing that tends to annoy or depress the animal in its weakly state ought to be avoided.\"\n\nThe following facts with respect to the production of rot, considered as a general disease, are chiefly taken from Dr Harrifon's Inquiry.\n\nPoor, clayey, and loamy lands are most subject to rot.\n\nGrounds that are always dry, or always under water, and such as are always sufficiently wet to preserve a constant running of water, were never known to suffer from the rot.\n\nPonds of living water are equally safe; but when attempts to drain lands have been made, and have not fully succeeded, sheep which feed on such lands are very much exposed to the rot.\n\nGrounds newly laid down for pasture, or ploughed fields that have been exhausted by repeated crops, where the sward is thin, and where the water remains in patches for want of proper outlets, are peculiarly subject to the rot.\n\nMarshes that are overflowed by the sea, and boggy situations, especially in Ireland, are seldom known to rot.\n\nLands that have been limed, and many soils that are chiefly composed of calcareous matter, are considered as very likely to produce the rot.\n\nEwes that are with lamb, or are giving suck, are less liable than other sheep to be affected with the rot.\n\nEight causes have been assigned for the production of rot, viz.\n\n1. A vitiated dew. It is stated in the survey of Lincolnshire, that a shepherd, who when young, was shepherd's boy to an old man that lived at Nettlam near Lincoln, a place famous for the rot, declared his persuasion that sheep took the rot, only in a morning before the dew was well off. His master's shepherd always kept his flock in fold till the dew was gone, and with only this attention his sheep were kept sound when all his neighbours lost their flocks. Dr Harrifon remarks, that if this cause were just, the rot should appear equally on all lands.\n\n2. The disease has been attributed to a gruit or earthy sediment that adheres to the grass after wet weather, or after the overflowing of running water.\n\n3. It has been supposed to be owing to the luxuriant and quick growing herbage that is produced in hot moist leasons. But all luxuriant pastures do not produce the rot.\n\n4. It has been attributed to the sheep grazing on some particular herbs, such as the butterwort (pinguicula vulgaris), the white rot (hydrocotyle vulgaris), round-leaved sundew (drosera rotundifolia), and long-leaved sundew (drosera longifolia); but these plants do not grow on every rotting soil.\n\n5. The disorder has been imputed to flukes in the liver. We have already stated our opinion, that flukes may produce the hepatic rot.\n\n6. The rot has been supposed to depend on the infection of sheep-pox. This opinion seems to have arisen from a confusion of terms.\n\n7. M. Daubenton considered the disease to be produced by poverty of food, and too much water. There is no doubt that these causes commonly produce the last species of rot which we have mentioned.\n\n8. Dr Harrifon is of opinion that the rot is always generated by the exhalation or effluvia produced by the action of the sun's rays on soils that are partially covered by stagnant water. After adducing a number of ingenious arguments in support of his opinion, Dr Harrifon sums up the amount of his doctrine in the following manner.\n\n\"From the various circumstances enumerated, I think I am justified in attributing the rot in sheep and other animals to paludal effluvia; but with respect to their nature and constitution, it is very difficult to form any rational judgment, as they have hitherto eluded the most subtle and delicate inquiries. It must, however, be admitted, si causa latet, vis est notissima; and consequently the subject, from its great importance to the public in general, is entitled to a serious investigation.\n\n\"Without heat and moisture, no deleterious vapours can be generated; and yet it is equally certain, that both these causes are insufficient to produce either a recurrent fever, or the rot, since they are confined to particular situations. Other auxiliaries are therefore necessary; and I am inclined to believe that vegetable or earthy particles, and probably both, are required, as well as heat and moisture, to constitute the noxious emanations or gases called miasmata paludum.\n\n\"Probably it will be found, on further inquiry, that a great variety of animal and vegetable effluvia are extracted in different places; and that many disorders should be attributed to them, which are at this time imputed to other causes.\n\n\"Poisonous vapours are extremely active and sudden in their effects, of which proofs may be found in the history...\"\nIndex.\n\nDiseases, history of every contagious and endemic disorder. We have, therefore, no reason to be surprised, that sheep and animals are so immediately affected by pasturing in moist places, where these effluvia are copiously produced in hot weather. Other causes operate slowly, and require such a long-continued application, that I do not think the rot can be induced by them, though I am of opinion, that by occasioning general weakness, they make the constitution more susceptible, and lay it more open to morbid impressions. In the human body, we know that fatigue, cold, fasting, and other debilitating causes, are efficacious auxiliaries, although of themselves they are totally inadequate to produce any contagious disorder. They, therefore, seem to contribute equally, and in the same manner, to facilitate the operations of many maladies, upon the human body and other animals.*\n\nIt is said, that for a short time after contracting the rot, sheep feed more heartily than usual; and for this reason, butchers and graziers, when they wish to fatten sheep speedily for the market, not unfrequently turn them into a rotting pasture.\n\nThe prevention of the rot will be easily suggested by attending to the facts and observations that have just been given, as it consists in avoiding the causes that seem to produce it, and avoiding or correcting the soil where it is found most readily to take place. \"It is confidently supposed, that decoctions of bitter herbs, with salt, have frequently preserved sheep from the rot. Salt is supposed to constitute a part of Fleet's celebrated nostrum; and we know that bitters are deservedly recommended to prevent intermittents, the dysentery and other disorders, which originate from exhalations.\n\n\"In Oxfordshire, Dr. Lower has frequently known six or seven spoonfuls of strong brine, and stale urine, with foot steeped in it, to be given with great success. This is done at spring and fall of the year, when the dew is counted the most dangerous. This course of physic is continued eight or ten days, or till the sheep eat their meat heartily; and if they were taken in time, there seldom died any in a whole flock. For the same purpose, Ellis recommends the following medicine in his practical husbandry.\n\n\"Take a peck or better of malt, and mash it as though you would brew it into ale or beer, and make eleven or twelve gallons of liquor; then boil in it a quantity of shepherds purse, comfrey, sage, plantain, penny-royal, wormwood, and bloodwort; add yeast, and afterwards salt, to the mixture; then turn the liquor into a vessel. After April comes in, give seven or eight spoonfuls to every sheep, once in the week, if the weather be wet; and if dry, not so often.*\"\n\nERRATA.\u2014N\u00b0 84.

Animals may eat less than usual, or they may refuse to eat at all, either from a want of that sensation in the stomach, which we call hunger, or from a dislike that the animal takes at the food that is set before him. Want of appetite is a symptom of several diseases, particularly of fevers and internal inflammations. When this happens, it would be absurd to force food on the animal's stomach, as it could not be digested, and would only aggravate the violence of the disease.\n\nWant of appetite very often attends very great fatigue. It is also very frequently the effect of an improper use of cordial and strengthening medicines. It may however, be the effect of weakness of the stomach, not brought on by those means. In such a case, cordials and tonics are very proper, and their use should be accompanied with gentle exercise.\n\nThis loss of appetite in the horse, is commonly called chronic indigestion, and is usually accompanied with a roughness and itching of the coat, the skin having the appearance which we have described in No. 328 under hide-bound.\n\nAn affection of a similar kind takes place in cattle, in whom it is called loss of the cud, from their not chewing the cud as usual. It is known by the animal's mourning, having no inclination to eat, or dropping his food, without swallowing it. It frequently arises from the stomach being loaded with hard food that is difficult of digestion, such as acorns, or coarse dry straw. It may also arise from a weakness of the stomach, which is not uncommon in hot weather, and may be brought on by confinement and want of fresh air. The treatment is much the same as in horses.\n\nHorses are subject to an affection of the stomach, in which they sometimes eat voraciously, or greedily swallow substances that are indigestible. Horses labouring under this complaint are called foul feeders, as they eat clay, mortar, dirt, foul litter, or even the dung of other animals.\n\nThis is properly a symptom of indigestion, and seems to be owing to a peculiar acrimony of the gastric juice, and in most cases there is evidently an acid upon the stomach. The best remedies are bitters, and other strengthening medicines, combined with salt of tartar, or some other antacid. The receipts marked 61 and 62 are well adapted to these cases. These remedies should be assisted by pure air and regular exercise; and where coliciveness is present, it should be obviated by the use of warm laxatives. Care should also be taken to keep the stable clean, and to have a quantity of clean straw below the manger, that the horse may not be tempted to eat other substances that are more injurious.\n\nA surfeit is sometimes occasioned by hounds eating putrid flesh, or that of horses that have died, or been killed when violently affected with the farcy. Arising from the former cause, the fatality which attended the hounds of Mr Finch in Kent, is a curious instance. In drawing the covers, the hounds met with the carcass of a diseased bullock, with which they gorged themselves; the contamination was immediate through the pack; they were generally seized with staggering convulsive fits, operating to so violent a degree, that eight couple of hounds died in the field in less than two hours, and it was supposed the whole pack would have fallen victims, but for the timely application of oil and other medicines. Mr Daniel, from feeding with the flesh of horses sent from a post stable, in which the farcy and the glanders had spread their ravages, had an opportunity of speaking to the latter; the hounds broke out all over in blotches, discharging a watery humour, similar to those occasioned by the farcy; they caused great stiffness, and were extremely painful. This inoculation took place, notwithstanding most of the horses were sent alive to the kennel, and were properly slaughtered, and none of the flesh was given raw to the hounds. Phytic, and taking them frequently to the salt water, and well rubbing the fores by hand with it, at length recovered them. For checking a common surfeit, ox gall and train-oil, equal quantities; the affected parts to be well rubbed, and some phytic taken inwardly will quickly restore them.\n\nThere are two diseases that affect the bowels, which we cannot consider more properly than at the end of this chapter. These are rupture and falling of the fundament. These may take place in any of the domestic animals, but they are more common in horses, as they are most frequently the effect of great exertion. Burstings or rupture, commonly proceeds from strains in labour, kicks on the belly, high and difficult leaps, especially when heavy laden. It may be produced by the goring of oxen, by being flaked, and by various other accidents. Gibbon says that he has known it produced by too deep an incision being made in inserting a rowel.\n\nThe bowel may be ruptured either at the navel, or through the rings at the back part of the belly into the ferotum or cod. The tumour, when not too large, will return on being pressed, as if it were merely flatulent, and the rupture or chasm may be felt. It is easy to conceive that such a defect is incurable, excepting possibly in a very flight case, and a very young subject; the intention must be to palliate, to render the animal as useful as possible, and as comfortable to itself. In a recent case, bleed, and give emollient and oily clifters, boiled barley, malt maltes, nitrated water. Foment twice a day with camphorated spirits, and vinegar warm; and poultice with oatmeal, oil, and vinegar.\n\nFalling of the fundament is sometimes occasioned by a falling of long-continued loofeness, and is most likely to be produced in such animals as are of a weak and delicate constitution, but it is frequently brought on by hard riding or hard driving. Mr Lawrence says, that he has frequently seen it in hard-driven pigs. According to Soley, it is in horses sometimes the consequence of docking.\n\nWhen this complaint is first seen, it may in general be easily cured. The gut should be returned as soon as possible, by pushing it up with the ends of two or three fingers wrapped round with a piece of soft linen rag gently greased; but before returning the gut it should be bathed with some astringent lotion, as a solution of\nPart VI.\n\nFAR R I E R Y.\n\nDiseases of alum or white vitriol, or port wine and water; and a little of either of these should be frequently injected. If the gut should become inflamed, it must be anointed with some cooling liniment, such as receipt No. 28. Care must be taken to keep the animal's bowels open, by frequent bran mixtures. If the complaint continues obstinate, nothing will effectually remove it, but cutting off a part of the protruded gut. This may be done with a common surgeon's knife, called a scalpel, but it is sometimes performed with a sharp red-hot cautery. The wound commonly soon heals, but the animal should not be worked for some time after; but should be allowed a long run at grass, or in a straw yard.\n\nCHAP. IV. Morbid Affections of Absorption.\n\nThe absorbent vessels of the human body have been described in the article Anatomy; and the structure of these vessels, in the animals now under our consideration, is sufficiently similar to render a particular description of them here unnecessary. The function of absorption, and the derangements produced in it by disease, will be explained under those medical articles that have for their object physiology and pathology. It will be sufficient for us, in this place, to remark, that many of the disorders of the animal frame, are greatly influenced by the state of the absorbent system; and that some complaints seem chiefly to depend on the loss of the proper balance between the function of absorption, and that of circulation. Sometimes the absorbent vessels are too active, while the circulating system is proportionally languid; at others the absorbent system is languid, while that of the circulation is either unusually active, or continues in its natural state. The former seems to be the cause of lameness, coffinitis, and some other morbid affections; to the latter may be referred the several species of dropy. We shall here only consider two of these affections, lameness, and swelled legs, as most of our readers will expect coffinitis treated of as a morbid affection of excretion, and most of the species of dropy must be considered as general affections of the system; and therefore to be explained in the next section.\n\nAn unnatural degree of lameness may take place from many causes; as, 1st. From the want of a proper supply of food, whether from this being dispensed too sparingly in proportion to the labour of the animal, or from its not being sufficiently nourishing. Hence we see that such horses and dogs as are hard worked and ill fed, are extremely lean.\n\n2d. In stallions lameness is often the effect of being suffered to cover too often, or too long at one season.\n\n3d. It is a common attendant on several acute diseases, as fevers, some inflammations, especially dysentery, or what has been commonly called molen greefe.\n\n4th. Lameness is a common attendant on old age. This symptom requires little attention, as it is seldom dangerous, except when it comes on very rapidly, and is attended with great weakness, and manifest signs of decay, in stallions that are too hard worked. It commonly soon disappears after the cause that produced it, or the complaint of which it is a symptom, is removed.\n\nA swelling of the legs is very common to horses that are suffered to stand long in the stable, without being worked, or in some other cases that will presently be mentioned. There is a swelling of the legs that is the consequence of hard work, strains, or other causes, that excite inflammation; but what we are now considering is a dropical swelling, consisting in an accumulation of watery fluid below the skin, similar to the swelled legs of old people, and chlorotic girls. It may affect all the legs, but it is more commonly confined to the hinder extremities. The swelling generally takes place above the pattern and fetlocks; but if it continues long, it extends further up the legs, and the skin sometimes cracks, and there oozes out a watery fluid, or sometimes a purulent or greasy matter. In this last case it has degenerated into grease, which will be considered hereafter.\n\nSwelled legs frequently take place in horses that are newly brought into the stable, or a straw yard; especially if they are not regularly worked, and their legs regularly rubbed down, at least twice a day. It is more certainly produced, if the horse should be suffered to stand long on hot litter. It is also not uncommonly the effect of wading through snow or cold water, especially when the legs are heated. It evidently depends on a decreased action of the absorbent vessels and veins of the legs.\n\nIt may in general be prevented by regular exercise, and frequent rubbing; but if it should occur in a horse that is too full of blood, it may be necessary to bleed and physic. If the swelling should continue obstinate, it will be proper to apply a blister to the part, or to rub the legs frequently with some stimulating liniment, and if the complaint is of long standing, it may be proper to insert a rowel in each leg; and the dispersion of the swelling may be assisted by rolling hay bands round the legs, by way of bandage. One of the most effectual means of preventing a return, will be firing, making perpendicular lines with the cautery from the fetlock to the coronet. Regular exercise and friction must be persisted in; and if the complaint is accompanied with general weakness of the system, a nourishing diet, and strengthening remedies must be added.\n\nCHAP. V. Morbid Affections of Circulation.\n\nThe pulse in the inferior animals has been very little attended to by veterinary practitioners; indeed the various common farriers and cattle doctors scarcely know animals, whether their patients have a pulse, or where it may be most readily felt.\n\nThe strength and frequency of the pulse in its natural state, differs very much in the several species of the domestic animals. It is in general stronger according to the size of the animal; but its frequency diminishes in the same proportion, it being quicker in the smaller than in the larger animals, even of the same species. We cannot undertake to state exactly the average frequency of the pulse, in the several animals, and the accounts given by different authors vary considerably. Mr Clark says that the pulse of a horse in health, and no way terrified or alarmed, is from 36 to 40 beats in a minute. According to Mr Blaine, it ranges from 45 to 55, being generally from 45 to 50 in large horses, and from 50 to 55 in smaller horses. Dr Hales found that the pulse of an ox in health, did not exceed 38 beats in a minute.\nMr Blaine, in his first volume, states the medium pulse of a dog at 80 or 90; but in his second volume p. 149, he says, that a dog has usually from 90 to 100 or 110 contractions in a minute, so that we may probably take the average at from 90 to 100. Perhaps the pulse of a sheep is slower by about 10 beats than that of a dog.\n\nThe pulse in the inferior animals may be most conveniently felt in the temporal arteries, which as we have said in No. 164 are situated a little backwards above the outer angle of the eye. It may be felt also at the corner of the lower jaw, on each side of the fetlock joint, on the inside of the hock, and at the heart.\n\nAs much is to be learned from the pulse, reflecting the nature of many diseases, and the degree of danger which they indicate; we earnestly recommend to our practical readers, that they take every opportunity of examining the pulse of these animals, when in a state of disease. We cannot here enter with propriety into an explanation of the morbid varieties of the pulse, as it would be only to repeat what is given in the pathological part of our work, to which we refer our veterinary readers; as the observations there delivered can be easily applied to the particular cases of horses, cattle, sheep, and dogs, by keeping in view the natural state of the pulse, in each species as above laid down.\n\nThere are two general states of the system, that may take place in all animals, and which are chiefly distinguished by the state of the circulation, as ascertained by the pulse. These are plethora, or fulness of habit; and debility, weakness, or inanition. The former is always attended with a fulness, and sometimes a hardness of the pulse; while in the latter, the pulse is weak and small, easily compressed or stooped by the finger, and is sometimes slower, but oftener much more frequent than natural.\n\nWhen an animal has been kept for some time on a full nourishing diet, while he is at the same time confined within doors, and deprived of that regular exercise, which is necessary to carry off superfluities, he becomes fat, corpulent, and full of blood, or what we call plethoric. In this state the veins below the skin, from their being greatly distended with blood, are very prominent, excepting in those parts where they are bedded in fat; the pulse, as we have said, full, and commonly strong, but in some cases it feels oppressed, as if the quantity of blood were too much for the cavity of the artery. The pulse in these cases is frequently slower than natural. The animal becomes dull and sluggish, averse to motion, and if he is obliged to exert himself, evidently does so with difficulty, pants, and labours, and becomes soon fatigued.\n\nThis plethoric state is extremely common in horses and dogs that are pampered with high living, and little or no work. A horse in this state, though he may look well, is far from being in good condition, and is by no means fit for active labour. In fact, if such a horse is put to hard work, before he is properly prepared for it, there is the greatest probability that he will be completely ruined. Instances occur every day of full fed idle horses knocking up, or even dying on the road, and a long list of violent diseases is the consequence of this plethoric state of body. It lays the foundation of broken wind, inflammation of the lungs, phreny, and above all of staggers, or apoplexy. It is no uncommon thing to see a fat well-looking horse, fall down in convulsions, while drawing a heavy load, owing to the diminution of blood to the head, from so great an exertion, while the vessels are too much distended. Most lap dogs and others who are parlour guests, commonly die of apoplexy. A lady of our acquaintance had a fine fat lapdog, who seldom quitted the cushion that formed his bed, beside his mistress's chair, where he was fed with the nicest bits from the dinner table. Jack had been unusually heavy for a day or two, and one morning was found lying dead on his cushion; though he had the night before eaten a hearty supper.\n\nTo prevent the ill consequences that must arise from this plethoric state, these animals should be regularly exercised, and not suffered to eat too much. Where the plethora has already taken place, and where no dangerous symptoms threaten the attack of some violent disorder, the best method of bringing the animal into good condition, is to lower his diet gradually, and as gradually increase his exercise or labour; but where the symptoms are such, as indicate approaching apoplexy, or some other dangerous disorders, it will be necessary immediately to bleed and purge, and to take care that the animal be not put to any violent exertion, till he be brought into good condition.\n\nWe must here remark, that frequent bleeding with a view to obviate plethora, is extremely improper, as it tends to produce the very state against which it is employed. Bleeding, therefore, ought not to be had recourse to, except in cases of imminent danger.\n\nThere is a complaint that sometimes appears among hawks, or cattle, when they are suddenly put on high feeding, at hocks, after having been long accustomed to a poor and sparing diet. It is called by the graziers, Hawks or Hocks, and is probably of an inflammatory nature, but as it seems to depend entirely on a sudden distention of the blood vessels, and is speedily relieved by removing this distention, it may properly be considered in this place.\n\nThe complaint is said to begin with an uneasiness and swelling about the eyes, and about the glandular parts of the throat, which extends itself gradually over the whole body, to the legs and joints; and in cows to the barren and udder. The animal appears languid, dull, and heavy, and seems unwilling to stir from the place where he is; and when the disease has made some progress, he will not lie down till he is relieved. The legs become cold and numb, and as the swelling advances towards the hind parts, a copious secretion of saliva commonly takes place from the mouth, attended often with a swelling about the tongue. The disease is extremely rapid in its attack and progress, and if it be not speedily attended to, it will terminate in staggers, or some violent inflammatory disease.\n\nThe cure of this affection seems to depend entirely on bleeding, which should be performed as soon as possible, taking away a quart or two of blood at first, and repeating the operation some hours after, if the swelling is not diminished. It is recommended to rub the whole body well, both before and after bleeding, and if the mouth is much affected, it will be relieved by walking it frequently with salt and water. If there is any considerable heat, it may be proper to give a drench with nitre every four hours.\n\nInanition is a state of body directly the opposite of inanition, what we have described; and is produced by very different\nThe artery that is most liable to be wounded in bleeding is the external carotid, which runs below the jugular vein, or sometimes a little to one side of it. This accident will, however, seldom happen, except when a ligature is used; but when this is employed, the jugular vein is pressed closely on the artery, that the point of the fleam or lancet may easily penetrate through the vein into the artery. M. Huzard alleges, that in this way even the wind-pipe may be wounded, together with the artery, and that the animal may be choked by the effusion of blood from the latter into the former.\n\nWhen an accident of this kind has taken place, whether from bleeding, from wounds, or from the erosion of an artery by the acid matter of a foul ulcer, it is necessary to take speedy means for preventing the ill consequences that may ensue; for, though the wounded artery be not very large, such an effusion of blood may take place from it, as may greatly weaken the animal, if it should not prove fatal. If the artery is very small, the bleeding is easily stopped, either by applying such a degree of pressure, as may be sufficient to obliterate the cavity of the wounded vessel, or, what is often more convenient, by completely dividing it; after which the divided ends will contract so much as to prevent the further effusion of blood. If the wounded artery be large, it can be secured with certainty only by means of ligature. For this purpose, pressure must be made on the artery, between the wounded part and the heart, while an incision is made through the skin and muscles down to the place where the artery has been wounded, so that this may easily be discovered. Then a pretty strong thread, doubled and waxed, is to be passed round the artery by means of a crooked needle, with a blunt point, and is then to be tied fast about an inch above the wounded part. A similar ligature is to be fixed upon the artery at about the same distance, on the other side of the orifice, and the artery is to be cut across between the two ligatures. Thus, the further effusion of blood is completely prevented, and the wound may be healed in the usual manner. The part that was supplied with blood by the wounded artery, will, if the vessel was pretty large, be colder and less sensible than usual, but it will in general be sufficiently supported by the small branches of other arteries that join with the wounded vessels beyond the ligatures; and these branches will gradually become so distended as to supply the place of the divided artery, and restore the part to its proper functions.\n\nIt sometimes happens, that part of an artery becomes unusually dilated, forming what is called a true aneurism. This dilatation may take place in any of the arteries, but it is most common in the aorta or great artery within the body, and in the external carotid and popliteal arteries without. An aneurism of the external carotid is often seen in dogs, and sometimes in horses, especially such as are accustomed to draw heavy weights. An aneurism of an external artery is easily distinguished, by a considerable pulsation, which may be felt much more superficially than the ordinary beat of the artery, and is sometimes so remarkable, that it can be distinctly seen by the alternate heaving and sinking of the skin below which the swelling is situated. An aneurism of the aorta is not so easily distinguished in the inferior animals. The diagnostic marks by which it may be known...\nknown in the human body, will be given in the article SURGERY.\n\nThose aneurisms are attended with considerable danger, and those of internal arteries commonly soon prove fatal. Aneurisms of external arteries are attended with a swelling of the bones over which they lie, owing to the increased absorption of bony matter produced by the pulsation of the dilated artery; and these swellings commonly burst in no long time, especially if the animal be exposed to any great labour or exertion.\n\nThe treatment of these aneurisms is exactly similar to that of a wounded artery described above. It consists in securing the dilated artery, either by pressure on the side of the aneurism next the heart, or by means of two ligatures, one on each side of the tumour.\n\nAn effusion of blood into the cellular substance may take place from a vein, the orifice of which has not been properly closed after bleeding; or it may happen from the orifice in the vein not exactly corresponding to that in the skin, so that the skin gets over the orifice in the vein, and prevents the blood from flowing out. In this latter case there is said to be a thrombus of the vein.\n\nWhen such an effusion of blood is observed, it is necessary to dilate the orifice in the skin, and to take away the clotted effused blood from below it. If the vein does not appear likely to bleed again, it will be unnecessary to pin it up; but if blood should still flow from it, it will be necessary to secure it by a pin. This, however, should not be suffered to remain too long, as it may produce inflammation and ulceration of the vein. Sometimes it is so long before the effusion of blood is observed, that the swelling is become considerable, and is attended with inflammation, or even suppuration. Where inflammation is present, but has not proceeded to suppuration, this latter may in general be prevented by keeping the part moist (after taking out the effused blood), with a solution of sugar of lead in vinegar and water. If matter is already formed, the swelling must be poulticed, or frequently fomented with warm liquors; and when the matter is let out, the sore must be treated as a common ulcer.\n\nSometimes the inside of a vein that has been opened in bleeding inflames, suppurates, and becomes a fistulous sore; and if this be neglected, the matter may extend to some important organ, as to the head, when the jugular vein has been opened, and produce death. When the vein is not very large, or the ulcerated part of it is inconceivable, it may commonly be healed by means of the actual cautery, or firing, as described in No 351; but if the wound is very large, or the ulceration very extensive, it may be proper to secure the vein by means of ligatures applied on each side of the ulcerated part.\n\nWhen the enlargement of any part of a vein takes place, without the vein having been wounded, the swelling is called by medical writers varix, or the vein is said to be varicose. This swelling seldom takes place in any of the domestic animals except the horse, in whom sometimes the superficial vein that passes over the inside of the hock sometimes becomes varicose, and forms what farriers call a blood-spavin. The enlargement of this particular vein is always accompanied by bog-spavin, or an enlargement of the mucous capsules in the same part of the hock, and the former seems to be a consequence of the latter, being produced by the compression of the vein, by the swelling of the mucous capsule below it, whence an obstruction of the blood, and a consequent dilatation of the coats of the vein.\n\nWhen the enlargement of the vein is not considerable, it requires no particular attention; but if it should increase so far as to be troublesome, methods must be taken for its removal. This may be effected, either by producing such a pressure on the vein as shall stop the circulation of the blood in it, or by tying up the vein with a ligature. In applying pressure, such a bandage should be adopted as may surround the whole hock, while the greatest pressure is made on the dilated vein. Mr Blaine recommends for this purpose a bandage including several of those elastic tubes, ladies' glove braces or tops are made of, which would occasion permanent pressure, and yet permit motion. But, should it still be found to refuse this, its removal must be attempted. For this purpose, an opening should be made above the enlargement, and then including the vein within a ligature, and an opening below likewise, including the vein also at that part; the enlarged part may then be punctured, to let out the discharging blood, and the remainder suffered to slough away.\n\nCHAP. VI. Morbid Affections of Respiration.\n\nIn many complaints, especially fevers and inflammations of the internal organs, the breathing becomes hurried, and inspiration and expiration, but especially the former, are performed more quickly than in the healthy state of the body. This hurried respiration, in the inferior animals, is known by the rapid heaving of their flanks; and when it is attended with considerable heat and dryness of the skin, it denotes considerable danger. Any particular consideration of this symptom will, however, be more proper, when we come to treat of the particular cases in which it occurs.\n\nThe principal affections of breathing which we shall here notice, are those in which respiration is rendered difficult, without being attended with fever or inflammation. Horses are more liable than other domestic animals to difficulty of breathing, and one particular modification of it, broken wind, is peculiar to this animal.\n\nThere sometimes takes place within the nostrils a snore, or gathering of thick clotted matter, which, when it comes to any considerable height, very much obstructs respiration, and produces a snuffling noise when the air passes through the nostrils. This affection is called the snores, or snivels, and is almost peculiar to cattle. It is sometimes mistaken for a disorder of the throat, where it is imagined there is some obstruction; but when this rattling noise is found to attend the breathing of cattle, it may generally be discovered whether or not it be the disease in question, by a careful inspection of the nostrils. The swelling thus produced in the nostrils generally goes on to suppuration, and when it breaks the animal is relieved. The object of our treatment must therefore be to halt the suppuration by the application of warm stimulating fomentations or liniments. A very common application in these cases is the oil of bays injected up into the nostrils; but perhaps the steam of warm water would answer every good purpose, and might be easily applied, by putting a warm bran mahl into a canvas bag, and tying it to the animal's head; and this may\nmay be repeated till the impostrume breaks. The animal should in the mean time be kept in a well-ventilated house, and should be fed on nourishing diet.\n\nCough is almost a constant attendant on colds, consumptions, inflammation of the lungs, and other pulmonary complaints; and when it occurs as a symptom of these diseases, no particular attention is to be paid to it, as our principal object is the primary affection. It frequently happens, however, that after the inflammatory affection is removed, an obstinate cough remains; and if this is attended with no considerable difficulty of breathing, and if the horse eats well, and appears thriving, the cough alone requires our attention. This kind of chronic cough is generally more considerable in the mornings and evenings, and after eating, and is generally increased by any violent exertion.\n\nChronic coughs, though generally a consequence of previous inflammation, may arise from a peculiar irritable state of the top of the wind-pipe; and if this be the case, the use of some narcotic substance, as opium or hemlock, may be proper. A very obstinate cough is often the consequence of preceding inflammation, and is attended with a peculiar noise, as if the aperture through which the air came was diminished. This kind of noise is called roaring, and it is found on dissection that the wind-pipe is contracted by a quantity of coagulable lymph, that has been effused during the inflammation. Mr Blaine has seen a preparation where the diameter of the wind-pipe was reduced to one-third of its original dimensions, and it has often struck him as not improbable that the grasping the wind-pipe hard, as is sometimes done to try the wind, may bring on inflammation, and occasion this affection.\n\nThese chronic coughs, especially the roarer, scarcely admit of a complete cure; but they may in general be mitigated, by keeping the animal warm, and by avoiding violent exertion. The food should be such as is easy of digestion, and does not produce much diffusion of the stomach. Tar is much recommended in these cases, especially for the cough, or hoofe, that sometimes occurs in cows. An ounce of tar, with the same quantity of vinegar of squills, and a little oil of aniseed is to be given every morning, in a quart or chopin of warm ale.\n\nOne of the most common defects in a horse's breathing is that which is called broken wind; the nature of which complaint has been of late much elucidated by Mr Coleman. According to Mr Lawrence, broken wind is discovered by the quick and irregular heaving of the flanks, and a more than ordinary dilatation of the nostrils; sometimes also, by a convulsive appearance of the body. But the usual method of trying the soundness of a horse's wind, is to cough him; which is performed by pressing the upper part of the wind-pipe with the finger and thumb. The strong, clear, and full tone of the cough, prove his wind to be sound; if, on the contrary, the note be short, whistling, and husky, the horse is asthmatic and unfound. Horses labouring under the worst stage of this disease, are styled, in the language of the repository, roarers; from the noise they make in work, of very little of which they are capable. Broken-winded mares are generally barren, although we have heard of one which bred a whole team of horses after she became so. In confirmed broken wind there is sometimes observed a palpitation of the chest, with constant contraction and dilatation, and now and then a considerable cavity or depression may be perceived.\n\nThe older writers had many strange opinions with respect to the nature of this complaint. Gibbon attributed it to an enlargement of the contents of the chest, and Dr Lover thought it proceeded from a rupture of the phrenic nerve. A friend of Bartlet supposed the disease to proceed from a morbid or obstructed state of the glands and membranes of the head and throat, the enlargement of which prevented a free passage to the wind. According to Mr Oliver certain glands, which are placed upon the air-pipe, at its entrance into the lungs, are become enlarged, and thereby the diameter of the tube is lessened; hence the received air cannot to readily make its escape, nor respiration be performed, with such facility as before; from which quantity of contained air the lobes of the lungs are always enlarged, as may be seen by examining the dead carcases of broken-winded horses.\n\nIt is now satisfactorily ascertained, that the immediate cause of broken-wind is a rupture of some of the air-cells of the lungs. The cause that most commonly produces such a rupture is over diffusion of the stomach, attended with hard and violent exertion. The horse being an animal that is always eating, will, when hungry, eat very voraciously, if he has an opportunity, and soon fills his stomach; and if, in this state, he is exercised violently, the circulation and respiration will be increased, but the lungs cannot expand sufficiently, because the diaphragm cannot defend from the pressure of the stomach. In this case, the circulation being hurried, the lungs do not undergo the necessary change, in consequence of their now being compressed. The animal then, endeavouring to take in more air, either actually occasions the cells to be ruptured, or something else to give way. If the cells are ruptured, the air escapes from them into the cellular membrane of the lungs, and there acts as foreign matter, or, at least, it cannot then produce the necessary change on the blood, when thus diffused; in consequence, difficulty of breathing arises from two causes: 1st, From the blood passing through the lungs before it has undergone its necessary alteration; and, 2ndly, from the rupture of the air-vesicles. The respiration is rendered slow, as is seen by the flanks being long in rising up, because there is no direct communication with the bronchia, as in the healthy state of the lungs; inspiration is, however, in a third of the time of expiration, which is seen by the sudden descent of the flank. The lungs, from containing more air, are specifically lighter than in the healthy state.\n\nThis local disease does not admit of a permanent cure, at least no medicine has yet had any such effect; but a temporary relief may be obtained, as we shall see hereafter. But we must not omit to mention here a most ridiculous practice which has sometimes been tried by common farriers, that of making an orifice above the rectum, and then introducing a machine similar to a musical instrument called a flageolet, with the idea of evacuating the superfluous air, or wind, which they suppose to have produced the disease.\n\nBlistering the wind-pipe, rowelling the chest, and a small purgative of aloes and calomel now and then, have often produced a good effect.\n\nA pound or two of rhot has been strongly recommended to Mr Coleman, as a specific; but, upon trial, it has been\nbeen found to have no obvious effect: it was thought that the hot would act by its specific gravity inclining the stomach further back into the cavity of the abdomen.\n\nThe treatment must be nearly confined to diet and exercise; the animal should have little hay, and water in particular must be administered with a very sparing hand. Those substances which afford most nourishment in the least compass, as carrots, corn, split beans, &c., should be given; the horse should always be worked upon an empty stomach; and, upon the whole, his diet should be small in quantity, but nourishing. By observing this method, a broken-winged horse may do a great deal of work, and be useful to the owner.*\n\nAccording to Mr Blaine, internal medicines have sometimes been found useful in this complaint. Lime-water has been employed with advantage; and the use of tar is much recommended. Mr Blaine prescribes a mixture composed of two gallons of lime-water, four pounds of tar, and an ounce of fresh bruised squills, or garlic, of which an English pint (or nutchkin) is to be administered every morning.\n\nA complaint similar to the foregoing often occurs in the horse, and is called thick wind. It proceeds from a very different cause, being always the cause of previous inflammation, during which coagulable lymph has been effused, as in the roarer. Thick wind may be distinguished from broken-wing, by the inspirations and expirations being equal in the former; while in the latter the respiration is not so frequent, and the principal difficulty consists in expiration, which is of course performed in longer time than inspiration.\n\nLittle can be done towards a cure of this complaint. We may prevent the disease by good management in the administration of the aliment, exercise, &c. Calomel has been employed to produce absorption, but without any great effect; a rowel under the jaw, and frequent applications of blisters on the windpipe, are the only methods capable of producing absorption of the lymph. Half a drachm of the digitalis, or fox-glove, in powder, twice a day, makes an admirable remedy in this, and local diseases of the lungs.\n\nThe breathing may be completely obstructed, either by the want of a regular supply of fresh air, or by the animals being obliged to breathe such kinds of air, as are unfit for respiration. The consequence of this impeded breathing, is a suspension of the vital powers, or, if the obstruction continues long, death will sometimes be produced. As suspended animation is always attended with more or less of an apoplectic state, we shall defer the consideration of those cases till we come to treat of comatous diseases.\n\n**CHAP. VII. Morbid Affections of Secretion and Excretion.**\n\nThe fluids that are secreted, or separated from the general mass of blood, by means of the organs called glands, are in some cases secreted in an unusual quantity, in others their secretion is lessened, or their excretion or passage out of the body is obstructed. Thus in colds of the head, as they are called, in glanders, and in some other affections, an unusual running takes place from the nose; in inflammation of the eyes the secretion of tears is generally increased, sometimes diminished, while it sometimes happens that their passage from the lacrimal gland out of the eye is obstructed. Again the secreted fluids may undergo various changes in their colour, fluidity, and composition. Thus the urine is sometimes yellow, at others red, or blackish; it is sometimes extremely watery, at others very thick and muddy, and in one particular disease, the diabetes, it seems to lose altogether the properties of urine, and appears like a solution of sugar, or honey.\n\nIn the present chapter, we shall consider the morbid affections of the bile, and of the urine. We shall also make some observations on coliciveness and purging.\n\nThe principal morbid affection of the biliary system that takes place in the inferior animals, is the jaundice or obstruction to the passage of the bile, from the liver into the bowels, producing the disease called jaundice in the human body, and commonly known to farriers and cattle-doctors, by the name of the yellow.\n\nThis disease seldom takes place in the horse, for as it is almost always the consequence of biliary concretions, or gall-stones formed within the gall bladder, and as this animal has no gall bladder, the disease in question can seldom take place. It may however happen that an obstruction may take place in the common duct or pipe, that conveys the bile from the liver, either from concretions formed in the duct, from a spasmodic contraction of the duct, or from a schirrous or hardened state of the liver. The disease is however sufficiently common in cattle and sheep; and a description of the symptoms that mark the complaint in these animals will almost equally apply to the disease when it may take place in horses. According to Mr Denny, young horses are very subject to a variety of jaundice.\n\nIts first visible sign is a yellowish tinge in the white part of the eyes, mouth, and tongue; the mucus and saliva, from the nostrils and mouth, are of a greenish hue, bordering a little upon the yellow. The beast is dull, and heavy, loathing all kinds of food, eating no more than a bare sufficiency for the support of nature; the skin is dry and itchy, especially behind the shoulders, where it can scarcely bear the touch. The beast has an utter aversion to exercise, or stirring from the place where they are, and if removed with the least degree of precipitation, will break into a cold sweat. Their urine is of a deeper yellow than usual, which has sometimes led to believe it was red water, or bloody urine. The dung undergoes a very considerable alteration in all stages of the disease, and its general colour is blueish or brown, and much resembling burnt clay; but it varies in colour according to the subject, or different circumstances and seasons. If the disease continues long the beast gradually pines away, and at last dies of a decline.\n\nIt is said that horses have sometimes died of jaundice, in two or three days; and in these violent cases a black fumous discharge has taken place from the mouth and nostrils a little before death. This is called by farriers the black jaundice, and after death the liver is found totally decayed. Mr Lawrence says that he has repeatedly seen cases of this kind. Gibbon speaks of an inflammatory species of jaundice, attended with delirium and madness; but this was probably a violent inflammation of the liver.\n\nWe have said that the immediate cause of this disease is an obstruction of the gall pipe, commonly owing\nto the formation of gall-stones. The formation of these concretions is most likely to take place, when the animals are deprived of their regular exercise, and are at the same time allowed too full a diet, or are given food of an improper quality. It is said to be very common in some of the cold provinces on the continent, where the cattle are stall fed during the winter; after which the most of them are attacked with it in the spring. It may sometimes be brought on by hard labour and poor living; but then it probably depends on a diseased state of the liver.\n\nIn the treatment of jaundice, our chief reliance is to be placed on the use of purgative medicines; and of these rhubarb, calomel, and aloes, seem to be the most proper; and during their exhibition, gentle exercise should be employed. Mr Denny says that much relief is often afforded in the jaundice of young horses, by giving a ball composed of an ounce of aloes, half an ounce of Venetian soap, and a drachm of calomel; every second or third night, and giving on the intervening mornings a ball of half an ounce of nitre, with the same quantity of powdered rosin, and of common soap. Mathees and warm water are to be given plentifully, and the horse must be kept warm by clothing, and fully exercised.\n\nIn cattle, a vomit of emetic tartar may be tried at the first appearance of the disease, as the effort of vomiting may assist in promoting the passage of the gallstone. If, however, the disease should arise in consequence of previous inflammation of the liver, vomits will be of no use, and the best remedies will be mercurial purgatives with soap. The food should consist of succulent and watery substances, especially of fresh grass; as it is found that when cattle affected with this disease are sent to pasture they commonly soon recover. Warm mathees of bran or malt should be given frequently, both to obviate coliciveness, and as being good articles of diet. If the disease should continue obstinate, and the use of mercurial medicines should be found necessary, the animal must be confined within doors, during night and bad weather; and a horse should during the exhibition of the medicines be covered with a flannel cloth. It will be proper, whenever the weather and other circumstances permit, to give the animal regular exercise in the open air; but if necessity obliges us to keep him within doors, the whole body, but especially the belly, should be well rubbed for a considerable time, twice or thrice a day. This friction will be proper, even though regular exercise can be taken in the open air.\n\nHorses, and sometimes cattle, are subject to a profuse discharge of urine; but as the complaint of which this is a principal symptom, seems not to be seated in the urinary organs, we shall not consider it here, but shall treat of it among the general and more important diseases.\n\nIt often happens that there is an inability in these animals to retain their urine for any length of time; they are either obliged to void it very frequently, and in small quantities, or, what is more frequent, it drops away imperceptibly and involuntarily, forming the complaint called incontinence of urine. This complaint differs from diabetes, or profuse staling, in the urine coming away by drops, or in very small quantities at a time, whereas in diabetes it passes off in a full and copious stream.\n\nIncontinence of urine is extremely common to dogs, and often arises in these animals from excessive venery, or from the violent efforts which they are sometimes, by the brutality of bystanders, obliged to make to separate themselves from the females. It is also not uncommonly owing to the presence of a stone in the bladder. M. Barruel, professor of the veterinary school of Alfort, had a little Spanish bitch, not above five inches high, and about seven years old, who was troubled with an incontinence of urine, unaccompanied by any other symptom; she was sprightly and well, and was in good condition. Not knowing what to attribute the complaint, M. Barruel tried a number of remedies, such as warm bathing and clysters of various kinds, but without effect; at last he killed the bitch, and found in her bladder a stone that weighed an ounce and 40 grains, a very considerable bulk, if we advert to the small size of the animal.\n\nThis complaint is less common in the horse, but it may arise in any of these animals from a paralytic affection of the sphincter muscle at the neck of the bladder; which is sometimes the consequence of the bladder's being unusually distended with urine. When there is reason to suppose that it is owing to this cause, the best remedy is a blister applied above the pubis, or the frequent application of stimulating liniments to the same part.\n\nA difficulty of making water, or even an entire suppression of urine, is a very common disease among horses, and frequently occurs in sheep. The symptoms accompanying this affection, differ somewhat according to the causes which have produced it; we shall therefore consider it under several heads. One of the most common causes of a suppression of urine, is suffering the animal over a long time without stopping him from allowing him to stale; a circumstance which is often neglected by thoughtless people, while on a journey. From the urine being so long retained, the bladder becomes excessively distended; considerable irritation takes place, and when the distention has proceeded to a great height, the animal, though constantly stimulated to relieve nature, is not able to effect his purpose, owing to a paralytic affection that has taken place in the mucular coat of the body of the bladder, attended probably with spasmodic contraction of the sphincter. If the animal be not soon relieved, a considerable swelling appears above the pubis, accompanied with great uneasiness; the urine becomes absorbed, and is carried through the circulation to various parts of the body, producing an itching of the skin, and generally, in no long time, apoplexy and death.\n\nSometimes, however, before any considerable absorption can take place, the bladder either becomes inflamed, or bursts, and discharges its contents into the belly, producing there inflammation and mortification.\n\nThis complaint is, as we have said, very common among sheep, constituting an affection which in Scotland is called the watery bloaty. It is said that young and vigorous sheep are most liable to it; and according to the writers of the ingenious appendix to Mr Findlater's survey, the immediate cause of the disease, is feeding too freely on succulent diuretic food, and resting too long.\nlong in their laires in the morning. It has been frequently observed, that this species of braxy is most apt to make its attacks upon Sundays, because shepherds generally sleep longer on Sunday mornings than other days of the week, and, of course, allow the sheep to remain too long in their laires. This disease may be prevented by avoiding too free a use of succulent diuretic food, and by moving the animals from their laires early in the morning, making them walk about for some time, in order to encourage them to pass their urine and purl.\n\nIn attempting to effect a cure, it may be known whether the bladder is affected, by a great fulness in the lower part of the belly, immediately above the pubis. The seat of the distemper being ascertained, a female silver catheter, or one of elastic gum, ought instantly to be passed through the urethra into the bladder of females. This will draw off the urine, and give immediate relief. But this will be attended with greater difficulty in males; and if attempted, must be done with a long and properly bent catheter or bougie. In either case, when this cannot be accomplished, a puncture may be made into the bladder with a trocar, directly above the pubis; taking care not to wound the intestines. By either of these methods, the urine may be discharged, and the animal relieved. In other respects, with a view to allay or prevent inflammation, evacuations should be procured by clysters and warm injections into the great gut.\n\n2. In the case which we have been considering, the urine, though secreted as usual, could not be discharged; but a suppression of urine sometimes takes place from the secretion not going on as usual, owing to some affection of the kidneys, commonly an inflammation of those organs. We can scarcely with propriety consider this case here, but shall treat of it among the other inflammations in the second chapter of the next section.\n\n3. Another case that may produce a suppression of urine, or a difficulty in passing, is a stone in the bladder, or gravelly concretions passing from the kidneys through the ureters or urinary pipes. We have just seen that a stone is sometimes found in the bladder of dogs; but doubts have arisen, whether this could take place in the horse. Examples of it are no doubt very rare, but we have sufficient proof that it may take place. Mr Clark of Edinburgh mentions that he has several stones taken out of different horses; and it is said that Dr Mead had in his cabinet one that weighed 11 ounces. M. Huzard gives an account of a dissection that he made of a horse that died of a suppression of urine, in whom the following appearances were observed. The bladder contained a considerable quantity of red and bloody urine. Its internal membrane was thickened, especially at its lower part; and it was also inflamed and gangrenous in several points. The ureter contained at about its middle, a fragment of a stone that entirely blocked up the passage of the urine, and had no doubt been the cause of this suppression. The stone was imbedded in a cavernous body like the kernel of a fruit. Within the bladder there was also a stone about the size of a large pullet's egg, broken into two portions.\n\nIf we consider that symptoms of gravel are by no means uncommon in the horse, that gravel is often found in his urine, and that calculous concretions have been frequently observed in his kidneys, we shall easily see that these cases are not so extraordinary as some may imagine. There is no doubt, however, that cases of a stone in the bladder cannot so frequently happen in quadrupeds, from their horizontal position, which prevents the stone from passing from the kidney into the bladder so readily as in the human subject. Hence the kidneys have often been found to contain stones of a considerable size, without the horse having been during life affected with symptoms of calculus.\n\nWhen concretions form in the kidneys, they generally produce a great degree of irritation, and consequent inflammation; but if a horse is affected with a suppression of urine, there is reason to suppose that a stone is lodged in the bladder. The certainty of this having taken place may be very readily ascertained, by introducing the hand within the rectum, as the stone will, for the most part, be felt below the finger.\n\nIt is not probable that internal remedies can have any effect in cases of calculus in the horse. In the beginning of the complaint, when the symptoms are very slight, diuretic medicines may be tried, and will perhaps bring away the small sandy particles; but if a stone of any considerable size be lodged in the kidneys, the case is incurable. If the stone has got into the bladder, it may be extracted by making a cut into the bladder above the pubis, and taking out the stone by means of forceps, such as are employed by surgeons in the operation for the stone. In the mean time the animal may be relieved, by drawing off the urine from time to time by means of a catheter, which is easily used in the mare, and by preventing coliciveness. Too much labour or over exertion should also be avoided, and the animal should live chiefly on succulent food.\n\n4. A suppression of urine may arise from an obstruction in or about the neck of the bladder. A curious case of this kind occurred to M. Huzard, and he has related the appearances on dissection, which were as follows.\n\nThere was at the base of the spermatic arteries, on the right side, a glandulous body about the bigness of one's fist, through which oozed a lymphatic fluid, that was whitish and thick, in some places appearing like pus. The bladder was enormously distended with urine, and extended into the belly beyond its usual limits; it was inflamed and thickened; the urine was nearly in its natural state. The neck of the bladder was filled with varicose excrescences, that completely obstructed the passage. These excrescences were red, and so hard as to resist the knife; they contained each a small particle of hardened blood, in which two parts were distinguishable. The bottom of the bladder was very black, and its surface of a reddish yellow; the whole of the urethra was red and inflamed.\n\nIt will be pretty evident, that, should a case like this occur, it is incurable. It sometimes happens that the urine appears unusually red, as if bloody. This affection may take place in any of these animals, and it is called bloody urine, puffing of blood, or red water. It is most common among cattle. It may arise from falls or bruises, from overtraining at hard work, as in horses from a hard run heat in racing, or after any violent exertion, such as a desperate leap; or it may proceed from inflammation of the kidneys.\n\nWhen it takes place in cattle, the animals are affected with an almost incessant desire to stale; sometimes they\nDiseases. they make but little water at once; sometimes the urine comes away in its usual quantity. In this latter case, if the urine be deeply tinged, it is considered as a very dangerous symptom, and when it happens, the beasts leave the herd, and appear to feel considerable pain; they hold up their tail, and sometimes hold their back higher than common. In fact, these symptoms, which do not seem well understood by the cattle doctors, indicate an inflammation of the kidneys.\n\nWhen this disease is occasioned by strains, bruises, or any violent exertion, there is reason to fear that inflammation may take place. This must therefore be guarded against by bleeding, cooling drinks, and succulent food; by avoiding exercise and every thing that can heat or irritate. It is a common custom to give nitre and other saline substances in these cases; but when there is any inflammatory affection in the kidneys, these salts are improper, as they tend to increase the irritation of these organs. The best drinks in such cases will therefore be thin gruel, linseed-tea, or bran-water.\n\nCattle are said to be most subject to the red water in the spring, or summer, while at grass; and it is supposed to be produced sometimes by sudden changes of the weather, by want of water, or the use of such as is unwholesome. Young cattle are more subject to it than those of more advanced age; hence particular attention should be paid to these young animals; as when the affection has once taken place, it is considered as highly dangerous. These are the opinions of cattle doctors, and we suppose they refer chiefly to inflammation of the kidneys, of which bloody urine is, as we have said, a prevalent symptom. This formidable disease will be considered more at large hereafter.\n\nIt appears that when cattle are sent from Europe, to the West Indies, the bulls when first put on shore are extremely liable to this complaint, which often proves fatal. It is attributed to the eager desire which these animals, after having been so long confined to a dry diet on board, have for green succulent food, in which they will of course indulge to excess the first opportunity. The remedies found most effectual are bleeding, and the administering of nitre and purging salts; but it might probably be prevented by housing the cattle immediately after they are brought on shore, and accustoming them gradually to their change of diet.\n\nSometimes the colour of the urine in sheep and cattle is nearly black, and they are then said to labour under the black water. This affection is not well understood, but it is probably a variety of the last. It is said to be produced by feeding on cold, wet land, and that simple removal of the cattle to a more favourable situation will often effect a cure. Mr Lawrence considers the black water as a symptom of incipient mortification of the kidneys, and commends bleeding, (unless in a cow), cordials and tonics, such as iron fillings, with bark, opium, nitre, in strong beer, if the progress of mortification be apprehended. We may remark, that, if mortification of the kidneys has taken place, which may in general be known by the stinking smell of the urine; all these remedies could produce no effect; and it would be much better to kill the animal it once, than be at the expense of time, labour and medicines, in attempting to effect a hopeless cure.\n\nA scouring or purging is a very common disease in all our domestic animals; and in some of them it is very dangerous, and very difficult to cure. The complaint is somewhat different in the several species, so as to require a particular description in each. Some horses are liable to be affected with a purging from the slightest cause, and on every exertion. These horses are called by grooms way-bay horses, and they are said to have narrower chests and lanker bellies than others; and it is to this unusual deformity that the purging is generally attributed. Some horses are said to labour under a nervous diarrhoea; those that are chiefly subject to it are young, and of a weak and irritable habit. The complaint generally appears on them only when at work; and when they are suffered to remain idle, their bowels are sufficiently healthy. Mr Lawrence had a favourite young horse that was subject to this nervous scouring, and on whom he tried a variety of medicines to no purpose, as it was found that nothing but idleness could arrest the complaint. To use Mr Lawrence's words, \"the nag whilst at play, was always fat as bacon, and very firm in body; but a week's work reduced his flesh, and caused him to dung like a cow.\" Horses of this delicate constitution require great care and attention, or they will not be of much use to the owner. They should have strong nourishment, but it should be given in small quantities at a time. Mr Lawrence recommends good old beans mixed with their oats, lucerne, or strong upland hay, with rice mathees, carrots, and occasional runs of grass.\n\nA purging may be brought on in horses by a sudden change of diet, as from hay to grass, or from grass to hay. Hence, in such horses as are liable to disorders of the bowels, these changes should always be made very gradually. It is very commonly the effect of exposure to cold while the body is heated, and is one of the least dangerous affections arising from that cause. A purging may also be owing to irritating substances, such as crude, unwholesome, or undigested food remaining in the bowels; and in these cases it is often attended with pain, from the formation of an acid in the bowels.\n\nA purging in horses is seldom dangerous, except when it arises to a great height, or continues very long, so as to produce a great waste of flesh, or very considerable weakness.\n\nIn general it is sufficient, in order to carry off a purging in horses, to avoid the causes which have produced it, where these can be ascertained; to wash away irritating substances from the bowels, by giving plentifully of diluting liquors, such as water gruel and linseed tea, or gradually to change the diet, if the purging seems to have arisen from improper feeding. If, however, the disease should continue obstinate, or be attended with unpleasant symptoms, means must be taken for checking or removing it. Some caution is requisite as to the plan of treatment to be adopted; as, if the complaint be checked too suddenly, some other dangerous affection might be produced. Veterinary writers differ considerably with respect to the treatment of diarrhoea in horses; some recommending gentle laxatives, as rhubarb, which Mr Lawrence considers as the safest anchor in these cases; while others strenuously advise against the use of purgatives, and recommend opium and astringents. Probably in most cases there is little need of laxatives, and after plentiful diluting, one of the best remedies will be clysters of starch or water gruel, with a small quantity of laudanum. If there is acidity in the stomach...\nflomach and bowels, prepared chalk or lime water may be given with advantage; and if there is considerable weakness, the strengthening astringent medicines may, in the latter stages, be used without hesitation. We agree with Mr Blaine, that these are less proper at the commencement of the disease.\n\nIn cattle this complaint is sometimes very serious, and farmers not unfrequently lose several of their animals by it in a season. This has induced them to call it the scouring rot. When the purging has continued long, it produces in these animals a general weakness and loss of flesh. Their skin sometimes hangs loose about the body; in other cases they appear hide-bound; the hair turns sandy, or of a grayish colour; their eyes grow pale; the pulse becomes weak and irregular; their excrements thin and flimsy, and frequently change colour, especially in the early stages of the disease; but when the complaint is pretty far advanced, the dung appears like half-chewed food; and in fact, in these cases the food appears to pass through the bowels without undergoing the digestive process. It is said that when the animals have been long affected with this scouring rot, they feel a great degree of distress and pain, when grasped on each side of the back-bone, just behind the shoulders; and this is considered as a sure mark that the beast has become tainted or unfeasted, from the scouring rot.\n\nThis complaint in cattle may arise from most of the causes that have been stated to produce it in the horse; but it is considered as being most commonly owing to their being overheated in driving, and to want of sufficient nourishment, either with respect to quantity or quality. It may be produced in cows, by their being constantly and too frequently milked, while they are deprived of proper nourishment; and it is not uncommonly produced by lodging on wet ground in autumn, and feeding on a coarse, unwholesome food.\n\nIn the treatment of this complaint in cattle, a number of strange remedies have been employed, such as hogs' dung, turpentine and butter-milk; dock root boiled in salt and water, and nettle root boiled in forge water. Among the most feasible receipts that we have seen, is one in Rowlin's Cow-Doctor, composed of three ounces of bole ammoniac, with two ounces of bay berries, and the same quantity of alum, of shavings of ivory, and powdered comfrey root, boiled in two quarts of skimmed milk, adding while boiling a handful of starch. This is to be given for a dose, for which, however, it is perhaps rather too strong. Mr Lawrence recommends that, on the first appearance of the scouring, the cattle should be taken to the home fold, and put on dry food, which will generally supersede the necessity of medicine. The remedy which Mr Blaine seems chiefly to rely on, is a decoction of an ounce of ipecacuanha, a drachm and half of nux vomica, half an ounce of galls, two drachms of alum, and 20 grains of white vitriol, in a quart of water boiled to a pint. Perhaps this decoction is rather too complex, and some of its ingredients may be spared. The receipt, No. 30, is well suited to these cases. It may be supposed that where the scouring has continued for any considerable time, the bowels are become extremely sore and tender. In this case, mucilaginous or oily substances would be of advantage, and they should be given frequently, both by the mouth and by way of clyster. Mr Lawrence recommends a pound of fresh mutton fat boiled in 3 quarts of milk until the fat is dissolved, to form a drink to be given warm. This, we doubt not, will answer extremely well. If the disease should go to an alarming height, starch clysters with laudanum may be given as a last resource. Mr Blaine remarks, that, in these cases, he should be disposed to try animal food altogether; giving broth to drink, or the blood of other animals, with meat balls forced down the throat; as he thinks it not improbable that thus a change might be effected in the constitution, which might pave the way to a cure.\n\nDr Dickson thinks that much advantage may be derived in these cases, from a strong decoction of hawthorn shavings and caffia, with powdered chalk, in the proportion of half a pound of chalk, four ounces of shavings, and an ounce of caffia, to be boiled together in two quarts (chopins) of water to three pints, (watchkins), adding the caffia towards the close of the boiling. A hornful of this mixture is to be given several times in the day, shaking it well every time.\n\nCalves, when first weaned, are subject to a species of purging which sometimes proves extremely obstinate; and it is said that the principal reason of the calf-feeders giving them chalk to lick, is to prevent this purging. It appears that this disease will take place in calves, when they are fed on the milk of some particular cows; and that when the milk is changed the complaint goes off. The purging may in general be checked by boiling starch and bean flour in their milk; and if it still continues obstinate, a little ginger and laudanum may be added.\n\nThis disease is extremely incident to young lambs, pinning in and it is called by the shepherds pinning, because when lambs the purging has continued for any time, there flows from the fundament a glutinous matter that fattens or pins down the tail to the hips, and prevents any farther evacuation. When this is observed by the shepherds, they commonly seize the lamb, and after washing away the glutinous matter from the tail, so as to disengage it from the hips, they rub the parts with fine earth, or other fine powdery matter, to prevent their sticking in future. Something of this kind is very proper, but hogs' lard, or any other greasy substance, would answer the purpose much better. The disease is said to be produced by wet and cold in spring, together with the ewes eating too greedily of soft moist grass. It may be prevented or cured, by removing the flock to healthy or poorer pastures, that abound with astringent or aromatic plants.\n\nMr Findlater remarks that among lambs fed with their dams, upon the rich improved pasture of Lothian parks, pinning never occurs; whence it is probable that it originates from milk concocted from poorer pasture, which gives more curd than cream to the milk, rendering the excrements of the lamb more viscid. When the mothers have little milk, the lambs are very rarely pinned. Pinning is therefore considered as a favourable symptom of the lamb's being well nurled. It is not considered as a disease in Tweeddale; though, if not redressed, it would be productive of disease. It is considered as an accident to be guarded against, and which, like other accidents to which sheep are liable, requires the shepherd to be constantly walking through his flock. No Tweeddale farmer would, on this account, remove his ewes and lambs to poorer pasture, where the lambs...\nDiseases. Lambs would be worse nursed; as he knows, that if the pinned lamb is timeously noticed, and relieved by pulling up the tail, all danger is removed.\n\nIn dogs. Dogs are also very subject to this complaint, and it may be brought on in these animals by any of the causes which we have mentioned as producing it in the other species. In young dogs it is often the effect of worms, and in this case the stools are slimy, greenish, and sometimes bloody. Common loofenets in dogs may be removed by much the same remedies as in other animals, as by ipecacuanha, opium, with starch, or arrow root clysters, and prepared chalk, if there is any acidity in the bowels; but where it proceeds from worms, it cannot be effectually removed till they are expelled.\n\nPurging must be carefully distinguished from dyttery, or what is called bloody-flux in the human species, and brakes/baw in sheep, as in this latter there are symptoms of inflammation, and commonly more or less of fever. The distinguishing marks of this disease will be considered hereafter, as we cannot properly treat of it in this place.\n\nCoffivenets. Coffivenets, or binding of the belly, occurs occasionally in all these animals; but it chiefly calls for attention in the horse, as in him it is more frequent and more dangerous. It arises for the most part from want of exercise, when the horse is kept upon hard dry food, as oats or beans. It is a constant symptom of colic and of inflammation in the bowels, and the continuance of it always aggravates these complaints, and seldom fails to produce them where they were not before present.\n\nIt is best prevented by occasional change of diet; by giving the horse barley boiled, or green food now and then, where he cannot be frequently sent to pasture; and every night or two allowing him a mash of bran, or, if he is of a very colitive habit, of malt. Regular exercise and good dressing, especially friction on the belly some time after feeding, are also good preventives. If it should arise to any considerable height, the bowels must be emptied by back-raking, and the administration of softening, laxative clysters, which may be repeated every three or four hours till the bowels become sufficiently regular. Purges given by the mouth, though they may, after some hours, remove the coffivenets, seldom fail to do more harm than good, especially if the complaint has continued long; and there is considerable heat of the body, fulness of the pulse, pain in the bowels, or great irritation. In their cases, while the bowels are opened by clysters, it may be proper to take away a little blood.\n\nSuckling calves are sometimes subject to coffivenets. When this happens, the chalk should be taken away, and half an ounce or an ounce of magnesia be given them in a pint of warm gruel; or if the coffivenets continue, a little rhubarb may be added.\n\nChap. VIII. Morbid Affections of Generation.\n\nIt has been wisely ordained by nature, that the inferior animals shall feel the passion of defile only at certain seasons; and these periods are generally so adapted, that delivery shall take place at such a time of the year as will be best suited to the rearing and feeding of the young animal. It is probable that in a state of nature these animals, whether male or female, do not experience inordinate desire, except at the proper periods; and when domesticated, the females are scarcely ever fallacious, except at these times. The males of these animals, however, in the domestic state, especially dogs, are occasionally subject to excessive lust, and all of them, during the periods assigned by nature, become sometimes very unruly, if not permitted to indulge their natural appetite. Should circumstances render it necessary to prevent them from indulging this propensity, they must be kept on a lower diet than usual, or have such food as contains least nourishment in the same quantity; and must be made to use more exercise than common. They must also be kept extremely cool, and horses should at these times have less litter to sleep on than usual.\n\nIt is of considerable consequence to those who make breeding an object, that the animals who are to copulate should not be indifferent to the act in which they are engaged. It sometimes happens that either the male or the female betrays a coldness or indifference, which may defeat the object of the breeder. When it appears that a stallion or a bull regards the mare or cow presented to him with tranquil air, or turns from her when he ought to do his duty, it is clear that something is wrong, and that the issue of such a forced connection would scarcely be worth the trouble of rearing. It is said that Spanish stallions are more subject to this indifference than others.\n\nIf an indifference of this kind should take place in an animal that is generally keen and vigorous, it would be wrong to employ any incitement to stimulate him to an action for which he has perhaps been unfitted by too much exertion of the same kind during the season; but where the animal is naturally thus cool, and has otherwise the requisite qualities of a good stallion or bull, it may not be amiss to employ some stimulating means before leading him to the female. He should be kept on a generous diet, and when particularly required, he may have a cordial ball given him, with a quart of good ale after it. This will generally answer the purpose, or, if it does not, the animal is unfit for his office, and should be discarded. It is a common practice among some grooms to insert a slice of ginger into the fundament of an indifferent horse, and this is said to have the effect of rousing his latent powers.\n\nIndifference for coition is more likely to take place in the females of these animals, and it is no uncommon thing for a mare or a cow to refuse the male. In general this is owing to a poorness of diet; and these females should, like the males, before being taken to be covered, be put on a generous diet with moderate exercise. Probably all strong, stimulating remedies, such as cantharides, which are sometimes given, do more harm than good, as they may produce inflammation of some internal organ, without producing completely the desired effect. The cordial ball and strong ale are the most innocent remedies in these cases, and where nature is tolerably sufficient, they will be the most efficacious.\n\nThe parts of generation in these animals are subject to certain accidents or diseases, and it is necessary that we should notice the more common of these.\n\nThe horse is subject to what is called a falling of the penis. This consists in a relaxation, and total weakness of the parts destined to sustain and support it in its natural\nFAR R I E R Y.\n\nIt may be produced by various causes, as by too great exertion in labour; hence it is common to draught horses that are hard worked. It may also depend on a violent spasm of the muscles of these parts, as this is always succeeded by a proportionate relaxation and atony. It is not unfrequently produced when a stallion is made to cover too many mares in one season.\n\nWhen the calf is flight, after returning the penis within the fleath, which should always be done, a pail or two of cold water, or of salt and water, may be thrown over it several times in the day, and the muscles may be anointed with some stimulating liniment. It has been advised to make superficial punctures about the yard with a sharp needle, and then to wash it with distilled vinegar; but we do not know whether this plan has been attended with the desired success. If the complaint continues obstinate, the penis must be bolstered up, and a charge applied over the back part of the fleath so as to leave sufficient room for the horse to make water. If the complaint is attended with a general weakness, tonics and cordial remedies must be applied.\n\nWhen a cow has been delivered with more than usual difficulty, or has been very long in labour before procuring assistance, it not unfrequently happens that the womb is inverted, or, as it is commonly expressed, the calf-bed comes down. This accident is more likely to happen to some cows than to others, and is more especially incident to those of a weak habit of body, and such as are unusually wide between the thighs. In such cows it would be proper to pay more than usual attention about the time when labour is expected to take place, and the fall in which they are left should be made very commodious, that they may frequently lie down, as the great weight of their burden will have most effect while they are standing. When the calf-bed is come down, it should be returned as soon as possible, by the operator clenching his fist after greasing it and putting it to the middle part of the womb, which he is thus to push gently into its place, and when it is up, he must take care not to withdraw his hand too suddenly; but it would be better to keep it within the womb for a little, as it will stimulate the adjacent muscles to preserve the parts in the proper situation. After withdrawing the hand gently, the external parts should be bathed with camphorated spirits, and the beast must be watched, to prevent the same accident from taking place again. It is the practice with some to lead the cow down a hill after returning the womb, as it is supposed that this is greatly advantageous to the parts recovering their proper position. If proper assistance cannot soon be procured, the inverted womb should be laid on a clean soft linen sheet, and carefully covered from the air, the irritation of which might produce an inflammation. If the relaxation of the parts is so great that the womb still comes down, recourse must be had to a stay, to put behind, to prevent the womb from falling down; and some have recommended stitching it to the adjacent parts with a wax thread. Probably this operation would be attended with more danger than benefit.\n\nCows and mares sometimes suffer abortion, or as it is called, slip their calf or foal, before the usual time of labour. This accident may be brought on by violent exercise, especially by leaping hedges and ditches; by sudden frights, knocks, or bruises; and it is also said that it may arise from bad smells, and ardent desire in the mare or cow; but these latter causes are probably imaginary. It is advised by some to keep cows who have slipt their calves as free from having any communication with the rest of the cattle as possible, under the idea that the accident may become infectious; and it is declared that experience has shown, that without great care and management it may go through the whole stock, and even return the next season, if the same cattle are kept. We cannot vouch for the truth of these assertions, but if true, the circumstance is very remarkable.\n\nWhen a cow or mare has slipt her young, unless this accident has been occasioned by great exertion, it is a proof that the animal is extremely weak, and she must be put on a more nourishing diet, and have strengthening remedies; but in general little is required after such an accident, but rest, and perhaps a warm bran mash. This latter may be frequently given to mares or cows during pregnancy, as colostrum may be a great means of producing abortion.\n\nSECT. II. OF COMPLICATED DISEASES.\n\nMany of the diseases, that have been treated of in the last section, are very important, and several of them highly dangerous; but those which we are now to consider, have a superior claim to our attention, either from their fatality, the rapidity of their progress, or their intimate connection with some of the most important or destructive maladies that affect the human race. They will, therefore, require a somewhat fuller discussion than we have thought it necessary to give to the diseases described in the last section.\n\nWe shall class them under the several heads of Fevers and Febrile Eruptions; Inflammations; Lethargic diseases; Spasmodic diseases; Dropsies; and Anomalous diseases; which will form the titles of as many chapters, the last comprehending those affections, of which the nature or causes have not been fully ascertained, with those that could not properly be reduced under any of the former heads.\n\nFor the general doctrine of fevers, inflammations, comata, spasms, and dropsy, we must refer to the medical articles of this work.\n\nCHAP. I. Of Fevers and Febrile Eruptions.\n\nAll the domestic animals may be affected with primary fever; and this may be either of an inflammatory or putrid kind.\n\n1. INFLAMMATORY FEVER. Synocha.\n\nInflammatory fever, as we believe, seldom seen as a primary or idiopathic complaint, except in the horse; and to the consideration of this fever, in that animal, we shall here confine ourselves. The symptoms are thus described by Mr Blaine:\n\n\"It is not easy to say what is the first symptom of fever in the horse; but from the effects that we see arise in some cases, it may be presumed that it is a cold fit. It is usual however first to observe this complaint, by...\"\nDiseases by the loss of appetite, and dull heavy appearance of the animal; the extremities are cold, and the trunk hot, or the body is cold, and ears are hot. If a horse is attacked with common fever, while he is at grass, he is found restless, roving about the field, with an unsteady staggering air, and his head held low; if in the stable, frequently shifting his position, and is evidently restless and uneasy. His pulse is generally full, frequent, and hard, the two latter states of it are almost always present, but the former may vary. If the mouth is examined, it will be found hot and dry, and frequently smells strong; the breath is particularly hot, and there is often an increased redness of the inner membrane of the nose, even though there should be no primary affection of the lungs. The eyes are dull, heavy, and sometimes inflamed, and the horse starts, and is at times drowsy, but has no regular sleep. In this fever the secretions are generally diminished, therefore the dung is hard, and in small quantities; the urine sparingly made, and high coloured, and the excretions from the skin equally confined, giving it a dry harsh feel. The respiration is quickened, which is shown by the heaving at the flanks, and which must be distinguished from that difficulty accompanying inflammation of the lungs; in which case the air appears drawn through a part too small for it, as though we were to breathe through a quill; but in fever it is usually only simply accelerated.\n\n\"This forms the first stage of the complaint, and sometimes immediately succeeding to this, is an attack on some one particular organ, as the brain, lungs, bowels, or kidneys; in which case it ceases its primary affection, and becomes secondary and symptomatic; but when it remains purely of the febrile type, as the disease advances the symptoms become more irregular, seldom appearing the same in any two subjects, arising from particular states in the individual bodies, varieties in the treatment, or from some peculiarities in the disease itself. The pulse in this second stage continues hard, but loses some of its fulness, and increases in frequency; the skin becomes moister, the urine is secreted in rather larger quantities, and sometimes to these succeeds a purging; the watchfulness increases, and the horse is often observed in these cases to chew a lock of hay, and let it fall from his mouth again, as though infatuated of its escape.\n\n\"This disease seldom remains very long in this state; but there either succeeds a gradual abatement in the hardness and frequency of the pulse, the countenance becomes more lively, the muscular weakness increases; but the irritability lessens; the animal appears more tranquil; the secretions gradually return to their natural state; the mouth becomes moist, and the heat regular and equable; and thus is formed a resolution of the fever. This kind of fever, I believe, seldom terminates in a crisis, nor often by sweating; perhaps, it may sometimes by purging.\n\n\"But when to the foregoing symptoms, instead of their latter appearances, there succeeds great restlessness, or sometimes constant drowsiness, the pulse becoming very quick, as from 70 to 80 pulsations in a minute, preserving some of its hardness, and accompanied with profuse salting, though at others the urine remains high coloured, and small in quantity, and the thirst unabated; when to these are added great prostration of strength, a fatal termination may be expected.\"\n\nWe have said that simple fever is not common in diseases, sheep or cattle; but when it occurs in these animals, the symptoms differ little from those above described.\n\nIt must be remarked, that though the foregoing description will apply to most cases in horses, all the symptoms here laid down will not often be found in the same case; but they will vary according to the constitution of the animal and other circumstances. Sometimes the fever will have less of the inflammatory type, and will approach to what is called a low or nervous fever. Cases of low nervous fever are, however, very uncommon among horses. Mr Blaine says that he has met with no instance of this kind, but that he was assured by a Mr Bloxham, a veterinary practitioner of considerable observation, that he had met with a well-marked case of typhus fever. In cases that approach this low type, the heat of the body is more irregular than in the pure inflammatory fever, and the mouth often continues moist though drink be refused; and the secretions and excretions are usually not so much affected. Sometimes there takes place a discharge of glutinous matter from the nose, and the eyes are watery. The pulse in these cases usually ceases to be full after the first 24 or 36 hours; and though it still continues hard, it is more frequent than before, and becomes small and irregular as the disease advances. This low variety of fever is more dangerous than the true inflammatory fever, and requires more particular attention.\n\nInflammatory fever may be produced by any cause that violently agitates the body, and unusually accelerates the motion of the blood. It may be produced by excessive exertion and fatigue, or by an exposure to cold while the body is overheated. It is said to have been sometimes brought on by a sudden fright. A very common cause in hot climates, is long exposure to the direct rays of the sun. Pure inflammatory fever is certainly not contagious.\n\nIn the cure of inflammatory fever it is necessary to draw blood as soon as possible; and the quantity of blood taken away should be in proportion to the violence of the inflammatory symptoms. We are disposed, however, to think, that a less quantity than is usually recommended, perhaps not more than two quarts at once, will be sufficient, as the weakness that comes on in the latter stages of all fevers, will be greatly increased by too much loss of blood. The blood should be preserved in a proper vessel, as directed in No. 162. That it may be ascertained how far it will be proper to repeat the operation. When blood has been drawn, the horse should be back-raked, or a hand passed up the rectum, and the dung drawn carefully away; after which a clyster should be thrown up, such as No. 17. of the receipts. It should be blood-warm, and should be passed up carefully and gently. If there is much determination to the head, a blister may be applied to the neck, or a feton inserted as near the head as may be. Cooling medicines may be administered, such as the drenches, No. 22. and No. 26. All heating or cordial medicines, and stimulating food should, in the early stage of the fever, be carefully avoided. The diet should consist of light food that is easily digested, such as sweet hay, or, if that can be procured, lucerne or sainfoin; bran mash, and, by way of drink, thin gruel.\n\nThe rational mode of treating fevers, lately intro-\nced into human medicine, will probably not soon be transferred to the stable. Grooms and farriers will not easily believe that it is necessary to keep a feverish horse cool, and allow him to breathe a free, pure air. The practice usually followed in these cases is to shut up the stable as closely as possible, and even to stop every cranny in the door and windows. This practice is not only sufficient to increase the disorder of the feverish horse, but even to excite fever in such horses as happen to be in the same stable. It is, besides, customary to cover up the horse with a load of body-clothes, in order that he may sweat off the fever; and probably these clothes are girded tight round his body by means of rollers.\n\nInstead of this absurd method of treatment, a feverish horse should, if possible, be put into a stable where there is not more than one horse. As these animals naturally love society, it is better that he should not be quite solitary, otherwise he might be put in a stable by himself. The stable should be roomy and airy, and should be regularly cleaned. The horse may have a light cloth thrown over him, but this should not be fastened more than is sufficient to keep it from falling off his body.\n\nWhen the inflammatory symptoms have subsided, and signs of debility begin to make their appearance, as they never fail to do in the course of a few days, a different plan of treatment will be required, as far as respects the administration of internal remedies. A horse labouring under fever must be carefully watched, in order to mark the time at which the inflammatory symptoms begin to give way to those of lowness and debility; and as the change is often very sudden, the horse should be visited at least twice a day, or oftener if possible, as were the groom or other attendant to continue the debilitating treatment after the symptoms of debility come on, such a degree of weakness may be produced as will not easily be recovered. The change will be discovered chiefly by the alteration of the pulse, which, from being hard and full, becomes softer, and in general weaker. This is the time to exhibit strengthening medicines; but these at first should be of the gentler kind, such as Peruvian bark, or willow bark, which may be given at first in moderate doses; and if the debility continues, the dose must be increased, and the medicine administered more frequently. During the whole treatment, care must be taken that the horse be not suffered to remain coltive, and his bowels may be kept moderately open, by giving him a warm bath every night. If the weakness becomes very great, and there appears much rattling of the heart, while the pulse continues low, it will be proper to administer some of the more powerful stimulant medicines, as camphor and opium, ammonia, or snake-root, as directed in the receipts No. 35 and 38. As the horse becomes convalescent, the stronger tonics, as oak bark, with ginger, may be administered twice or thrice a day; and as his appetite returns, he may be indulged with his usual food, with gentle exercise. It will be proper, however, to avoid any considerable exertion for a long time after the animal has become convalescent, as a considerable period must elapse before the body can recover its usual strength and vigour.\n\nInflammatory fever precedes or accompanies most violent inflammations, especially those of the brain and other viscera, and it generally ushered in several of the diseases. In some of these complaints the fever demands particular attention; but in most of them it is merely a secondary symptom, and yields to the general treatment of the disease.\n\n2. EPIDEMIC PUTRID FEVER. Typhus, Murrain, Pest, Garble, Epizootic, Fr.\n\nPutrid fever does not commonly attack horses, though putrid fever has occasionally raged epidemically among these animals. Lancisi, an Italian physician, has described an epidemic fever that raged among horses in Italy about the year 1712, and Mr. Ofner mentions an epidemic of a similar kind, attended with critical abscesses. He calls it the distemper, and says that it had raged at different periods for more than 50 years.\n\nThe most serious epidemic fevers that have ever appeared among domestic animals, are those which, from their violence and fatality, have been called murrains, or pestis, and which have raged occasionally from the earliest historical accounts.\n\nColumella mentions a contagious disease, which he calls cruditas, that scarcely differs in its symptoms from the murrains that we are presently to describe. The following is his description. \"Crebri ructus, ac ventris fonsit, faecida cibi, nervorum intenso, habitas oculi, propter qua bos neque ruminat, neque lingua se detegit.\" He advises bleeding in the tail, and back-raking, and clysters; and if it appears that the disease is contagious, he recommends the infected cattle to be separated from the rest of the herd.\n\nA similar disease is also described by Vegetius, who recommends a similar treatment, with the additional advice: \"Mortua cadavera ultra fines ville projicienda sunt, et altissime obruenda sub terris;\" To carry the carcasses to a distance from the farm, and bury them deep in the earth.\n\nMarius, a Burgundian ecclesiastic, who wrote in the 6th century, mentions a disease, which he considers as the smallpox, that destroyed great numbers of cattle, \"Hoc anno (570) morbus validus, cum profusivo ventris et variola, Italiam, Galliamque valid\u00e8 affluit, et animalia bubula per loca supercypria maxima interrunt.\"\n\nThe first accounts that we have of any disorder of head's, this kind, since the beginning of the present century, are related by Ramazini and Lancisi, two physicians then living in Italy, where this disorder first broke out, in the year 1711, in the territories of the republic of Venice in the country round Padua; and was said to have been brought from Dalmatia, a province of Turkey, by some merchants importing living cattle, according to their annual custom, from that and the neighbouring parts. The disease soon spread itself through most parts of Italy beyond the river Po, and appeared two years after in the duchy of Ferrara, where it ravaged the country, in the years 1713 and 1714, that Lannonius, a celebrated physician of that time, informs us, it was a prevalent opinion, that the whole species would quickly become extinct. From Italy it travelled through the Tyrol into France. Shortly after Germany suffered, as well as the low countries; and from these parts it was supposed to have been transported into Great Britain and Ireland. But there is no\nno record of a new infection in this country since the year 1714, till the middle of last century, when we probably received the infection from Holland, where this disorder then reigned, having received the infection from some of the neighbouring parts of Germany and Flanders.\n\nAbout the year 1744, it was reported to have been brought by some traders into Essex, who had purchased calves in Holland, or some other of the provinces of the low countries, which had the infection, and spread through several counties, till it became a matter of importance to the state; and on the 13th of February 1745 gave occasion to the passing of an act of parliament, commanding that every probable, or even possible, means should be employed, by officers appointed for that purpose, to prevent the farther spreading of it. Premiums were given to those who killed their cattle as soon as the infection made its appearance; and fines were imposed upon every one who acted in opposition to the established laws, respecting driving, exposing, or selling cattle, supposed or found to have caught the disorder. Every precaution, however, which could be suggested at that time, proved ineffectual; and fresh orders were issued by his majesty in council, which for some time were also found to produce very little effect. It became so alarming to the country, that many eminent medical characters in different parts of England, closely applied themselves to the study of remedies for this calamitous distemper. They differed in opinion, whether it was a disease of an infectious nature, or proceeded from a malignancy in the state of the atmosphere, or some peculiarity in the nature of their food. The contradictory opinions which prevailed among them, nearly prevented some of the ablest professional men from appearing in behalf of the public; especially Dr Barker, who wrote an ingenious pamphlet on the subject, and whose mode of treatment proved more successful than that of many others, whose pretensions were given to the public in a more confident manner, and more strenuously supported.\n\nFrom the several histories that have been given of the disorder, it appears to have differed in its symptoms and effects, according to the countries in which it appeared; the various seasons in which it commenced its ravages, and some other circumstances not fully ascertained. There seems to have been no doubt that the disease was infectious, or at least that it was easily propagated among the species of animals which it attacked; but it does not appear to have been capable of spreading to other species; as men, horses, sheep, and dogs, that lived in the neighbourhood of the infected cattle, showed no marks of having received the contagion.\n\nIn the historical sketch of the writers on veterinary medicine, we mentioned several works on the subject of the murrains that prevailed over Europe in the last century; and of these it will have appeared that the greater part were the production of foreigners. The most celebrated of these foreign publications were those of Sauvages, Go\u00eblicke, and Camper. The work of the latter upon this subject is extremely valuable; and as it was written for the instruction of people in general, having been delivered in the form of lectures before a crowded audience, it is preferable to many others that have appeared on the subject. It is given in the third volume of Camper's works on natural history, physiology, and comparative anatomy, lately published at Paris. Camper delivered four lectures; in the first of which he explains to his hearers the structure and direction of the principal blood-vessels of the neck and extremities in cattle, and the natural position and appearance of the entrails of these animals. In the second he describes the natural structure of the four stomachs, the liver, and the spleen, and of the heart and lungs. In the third he explains the function of rumination, or chewing the cud, in all ruminating animals, but especially in cattle. In the fourth lecture he gives an account of the several writings that had appeared on the subject of epizootic diseases; among which he particularly recommends a German work by Dr Krunetz, that of Go\u00eblicke, and those of our countrymen Brockleby and Layard. In the same lecture he gives a very accurate detail of the symptoms of the disease as it appeared in the province of Groningen in the year 1768, with the appearances on diffusion; his own opinion with respect to the nature of the malady, and an account of the most approved method of treating it. We regret that this work came into our hands too late for us to make any considerable use of it in this article.\n\nThe medical practitioners in England, to whom we are most indebted for an accurate account of the symptoms of this disorder, and a rational mode of treating it, are Dr Brockleby and Dr Layard. As the account given by these gentlemen differs in several particulars, though there can be no doubt that both describe the appearances which fell under their own observations, we shall extract a few particulars from both their publications. The following is Dr Brockleby's account of the disease.\n\nFor ten days or a fortnight the cattle were troubled with a dry cough, which is indeed not an uncommon symptom among cattle, at that time of the year, and therefore Dr Brockleby did not consider it belonging to the present disease; the hair was rougher on the skin than ordinary; their eyes looked heavy, and, when the principal disorder appeared, they refused fodder, but had an insatiable thirst for a time. The milk-cows decreased in their milk, which remained to a certain quantity, sometimes for two days, before it changed colour, but at length often dried up. Upon ceasing to chew the cud, a shivering seized them all over, and a high fever immediately came on; the milk, if any remained to that time, curdled over the fire, but did not in the first of the disorder. At first the belly was colicive, but for the most part a loofenefs succeeded within forty-eight hours after the shivering fit. The stools were first green and watery, and of a itching smell; their constipation, however, altered afterwards to a viscid, flinty matter, the purging accompanied till about the seventh day, and about that time the excrements became thicker, in such as recovered; and these soon chewed their cud again, and tasted of fodder, which they had before absolutely refused through the whole disease. All that had not the loofenefs before the third day died. The urine was very high coloured, and in smaller quantities. The degree of fever was observed very high; upon the third day the pulse beat near a hundred times in a minute, whereas the ingenious Dr Hales found a sound ox's artery not to exceed 39 pulses, in the same time. At different intervals,\nvals, after the attack, they all laboured under a prodigious difficulty and panting for breath; some suffered these after the first day, others not before the third. But this disorder suffered remissions, and seemed to be augmented towards evening, and at night. Several beasts discharged, towards the fourth or fifth day, when ill, a very great quantity of a frothy liquor from the mouth and eyes; others ran actually purulent matter from the nostrils. As the disorder advanced, the eyes sunk more in their orbits, and some were observed to be quite blind. Towards the conclusion, the fore parts of the body, and particularly the glands about the head, were prodigiously swelled, and several beasts had a universal emphysema, or crackling of air beneath their skin; those that were not blooded, equally with such as were. Frequently one might observe pustules break out on the fifth or sixth days, all over the neck and fore parts. Some cattle were raging mad on the first day; such were necessarily killed; some dropped down suddenly; others died on the third, most on the fifth or seventh, very few alive to the fourteenth day; before death the horns and legs grew remarkably cold.\n\nThe appearances in the dead bodies of eight different cows were as follow: The flesh was of a sound colour, and everywhere lined with fat, the cellular membrane between the skin and flesh was distended with air to above the thickness of three inches. The paunch was prodigiously distended with food, in all of them, but it contained not anything preternatural; nor indeed in the reticulum or second stomach, were there any morbid appearances; but, upon incision of the omasus, or third stomach, in which the food is naturally without much juice, a most offensive stench rushed out, with a large quantity of thin greenish water.\n\nThe blood-vessels on the inner surface of the ventricle were very full. The abomasus and part of the intestines discovered the like morbid phenomena. The liver, spleen, and kidneys were as usual; but the gall-bladder seemed to be in the greater number fuller than ordinary; the consistence of some was thicker than the rest, and the gall tasted disagreeably sweetish. Dr Brocklesby did not observe any purulent matter investing the inner surface of the intestines, though other gentlemen discovered such, in some cattle, if new as rightly informed; but there appeared in some a slimy mucus, all along the intestinal canal.\n\nThe lungs universally showed the strongest signs of a preceding high inflammation; most of them were turgid with red blood, while the smallest vessels of the bronchia, or air-vessels, were very much inflated. Some few arterious vessels were replete with a gelatinous, glairy mucus, and all the lungs appeared larger than they do in common. The whole inner surface of the trachea, or wind-pipe, was covered with a frothy mucus; but he never found any ulcers with purulent matter either at the root of the tongue, or in the lungs. Upon opening two or three heads, he found large quantities of extravasated serum; and the blood retained fluidity in the larger vessels long after death.\n\nThe method of treating the cattle recommended by Dr Brocklesby is as follows: Before the cattle are seized, he advises two fetons, or pegs, to be put deep into the dewlap, and into the under part of the neck; and immediately upon refusing fodder, the beasts should have three quarts of blood taken away; and after twelve hours, two quarts more; after the next twelve hours about three pints may be let out; and after the following twelve hours, diminish a pint of blood from the quantity taken away at the preceding blood-letting; lastly, about a single pint should be taken away in less than twelve hours after the former bleeding; so that when the beast has been bled five times, in the manner here proposed, the worst symptoms will, it is hoped, abate; but if the difficulty and panting for breath continue very great, he sees no reason against repeating bleeding, or at least against taking away the fifth time, instead of a single pound, twice that quantity.\n\nIn the mean time the fetons or pegs should be daily promoted to suppuration by moving the cord; and the cattle should have as much bran-water as they choose to drink juice-warm. This should be made a little tart or sourish, either with common vinegar or spirit of vitriol; and immediately after the first bleeding they should have a drench composed of a drachm and a half of camphor, well rubbed with two ounces of honey, adding an ounce and a half of nitre, and about a quart of water-gruel.\n\nIt is extraordinary that this treatment, with a little variation in the internal medicine is recommended by Mr Feron as the result of his own experience, in what he calls the general inflammation of cattle. It is a curious coincidence; as we suppose that Mr Feron, from his not noticing Dr Brocklesby's pamphlet, has never seen it.\n\nThe doctor recommends keeping the cattle very warm, and guarding against the admission of any cool air, a practice in which he will scarcely be followed at the present day.\n\nThe symptoms of this disorder as described by Dr Layard are, on the first appearance of the infection, a decrease of appetite; a poking out of the neck, implying some difficulty in deglutition, a shaking of the head, rain, as if the ears were tickled; a hanging down of the ears, and deafness; dimmness of the eyes; and a moving to and fro in a constant uneasiness. All these signs, except the last, increase till the fourth day. Then a stupidity and unwillingness to move, great debility, total loss of appetite, a running at the eyes and the nose, sometimes sickness, and throwing up of bile, a husky cough, and shivering. The head, horns, and breath are very hot, while the body and limbs are cold. The fever, which was continued the three first days, now rises and increases towards evening; the pulse is all along quick, contracted, and irregular. A constant diarrhoea, or scouring of fetid green faeces, a flanking breath, and nauseous streams from the skin, infect the air they are placed in. The blood is very florid, hot, and frothy. The urine, or stale, is highly coloured; the roofs of their mouths, and their barbs, are ulcerated. Tumours, or boils, are to be felt under the panniculus carnosus, or fleshy membrane of the skin; and eruptions appear all along their limbs, and about their legs. If a new milch-cow be thus ill, her milk dries up gradually, her purging is more violent, and on the fourth day she is commonly dry. There is such acrimony or sharpness in their dung, that a visible irritation is to be observed during some time in ano. They groan much, are worse in the evening, and mostly lying down. These symptoms continue increasing till the seventh day from the invasion, on which generally, though...\nDiseases though sometimes protracted till the ninth, the crisis or turn takes place.\n\nIf after the seventh day from the invasion (at which time a crisis may be expected), the eruptions, boils, or abscesses are decreased in bulk, or totally disappear, without having broken or discharged outwardly, or an aggravation of the symptoms already mentioned, with no intermission; it may be affixedly pronounced, that the beast will die.\n\nAs to the cure, immediately upon the first appearance of the distemper, the beast should be put into some place where it may be kept clean, warm, and as free as possible from infectious steams of other beasts in the same condition. The beast must be bled in proportion to its strength, washed with warm water and vinegar, to clear the hair from filth and insects, and rubbed every morning and evening, for a quarter of an hour, with a dry linen or woollen cloth, or straw, to promote perspiration. A rowel also is to be made in the dewlap, which is to be dressed twice every day, which rowel is also to be kept in a month at least after the recovery of the beast.\n\nShould the beast be hot, hang down his head, breathe with difficulty after the bleeding, dung hard, and the skin feel tight and thick; then it will be very proper to give a gentle, cooling purge in this first stage. When the beast has voided the hardened dung, or if it should not have wanted purging, the following drench is to be given. Take of madder-root, three ounces; of turmeric and horse-radish-root, each one ounce; of fenugreek-seeds, bruised, two ounces; of chamomile-flowers, dried leaves of feverfew, rue, and sage, of each one handful. Boil them half an hour in a gallon of small ale, well hopped, to three quarts; then strain the liquor, and give the beast three pints in the morning, and the remainder in the evening. No dry or solid fodder is to be offered till the beast chews the cud again. Between these drenches a quart or two of distilled vinegar-whey must be given frequently in the day, to dilute the hard fodder, and strengthen the coats of the stomach; and hay-water may be also given. Great care must be taken, twice or thrice a-day, to cleanse the mouth, barbs, and nostrils of the distempered cattle, with some abating acidulated liquor. On the fourth day, if the beast be heavy, dull, shivering, no pimples or knots arise, and a purging be coming on, the following drench must be given at about eight in the evening, and repeated three or four nights, as occasion requires.\n\nTake of Virginian snake-root, contrayerva root, chamomile-flowers powdered, of each half an ounce; Venice treacle, fix drachms: Mix all these in three pints of vinegar-whey, and give the drench lukewarm. Let a person fit up all night with the beast, and give it frequently a quart of vinegar-whey. Venice treacle may also be serviceable; and if there be any signs of mortification from the dark and relaxed appearance of the mouth, the coldness of the skin, the black fetid dung, insensibility, &c., the Peruvian bark must be instantly given every four or six hours, as occasion may require, taking the usual medicines in the intervals. In the last stage, let the swellings that puff up the skin be opened and digested; and after the crisis takes place, if a scouring should ensue, it is not to be hastily stopped, though diligently watched and restrained, lest it weaken the beast too much; and to cleanse the stomach and bowels, let a purge of rhubarb, fennel, &c. be given. Dr Layard advises to let the beast drink water-gruel lukewarm, and keep it on dry meat, though sparingly; and at night to give an ounce of electuary of cardiodium, in a quart or three pints of small ale, warm. But if after the crisis the beast is coltive, and the skin dry, harsh, and tight on the flesh; dunging may be procured by giving in the evening a mash of bran, with a handful of beans bruised, and an ounce of Epsom salt. He recommends, however, the greatest exactness in observing when the crisis is over; for the least laxative medicine, or opening food, at the height of the disease, and consequently in the former stages of expulsion and maturation, will certainly bring on a scouring, attended with fatal consequences, or at least very difficult to be removed. In winter time, the cattle, upon recovery, should not be turned out at once to the pasture-grounds, let these be ever so dry; but towards the middle of the day, in fair weather, turning them out two hours, and then bringing them in again, will gradually use them to the open air. In summer, morning and evening will be the most suitable times; for the heat of the sun, or cold, may bring on other disorders.\n\n\"A farmer, (says Dr Layard), lost ten head of cattle, and two more were dying, and seven others ill, when I took upon me the direction of the seven which were last fallen ill. By the preceding treatment five of these recovered. One cow, very near her time of calving, died; and the seventh was certainly lost for want of observing the due time of the crisis, and purging too soon.\"\n\nSuch are the accounts given by Brockleby and Layard, of the symptoms and treatment of this destructive malady; and it will be seen that their accounts differ no more than what may be expected from two different persons describing a similar disease that occurred at two different periods; for the murrain described by Dr Brockleby appeared in the years 1744 and 1745, while that of which Dr Layard has given an account occurred between 1750 and 1760.\n\nThe causes and nature of this disease have not been exactly ascertained. Some have supposed it connected with a peculiar state of the atmosphere, and that it did not originate in contagion. Many considered the principal causes of the disease to be previous hard winters, obstructed perspiration, worms in the liver, and corrupted food.\n\nHard winters have been considered as a cause of this disease, because it was in 1710, after the hard winter in 1709 that the great mortality among the cattle was observed; and because the hard winter in 1740 was followed by the contagion in 1741, which spread over the most part of Europe. Not to mention many others, the murrain in 1768, followed immediately after a pretty hard winter in 1767. On the other hand Camper remarks, that the hard winter in 1727 was not followed by the contagion; from which it would appear that the epidemic does not necessarily depend on the severity or mildness of the preceding winter.\n\nIt was attributed by many to obstructed perspiration; and to prevent its attack, it was proposed to cover the cattle during the nights of autumn, and to make them sleep within doors during the spring nights.\nDiseases. It may, however, be observed, that if this reasoning were true, the disease ought to have been less prevalent, or ought not to have appeared at all, in those provinces where, for the sake of saving the dung, they house the cattle at night, even in the summer, as well as in the spring and autumn. Besides it appears that the contagion was not known at Bern, though the cattle in that district lay all night in the field whenever the weather would permit.\n\nCamper justly ridicules the idea of the disease originating from worms in the blood, or in the liver.\n\n\"If (says Camper), you demand of me, to what I attribute the first origin of the distemper, I shall answer, as it were to be wished that all naturalists would do in similar cases, that I do not know; that the subject is above my comprehension, and doubts above that of every man.\"\n\nThere seems no doubt, however, that the complaint was infectious, and that provided proper means were taken to prevent infection, the distemper would not spread. The means proposed by Dr Layard and some other medical practitioners, to destroy the contagion, was to bury the carcases of the infected animals, and to slaughter all that appeared to have received the infection. Inoculation was proposed by some, as a means of diminishing the ravages of the murrain; and is said to have been practised in Denmark with considerable success: but if this be true, it is probable that the epizootic disease that raged in Denmark was of a different nature from that which appeared in Britain, and on some parts of the continent; as inoculation seems to have been tried in these places without effect. What probably led to the proposal of inoculation was, that the disease was considered by some as exactly similar to the smallpox in the human body. This opinion was adopted by Dr Layard, and seems to have arisen from the boils or suppurating tumours which appeared on the bodies of most of the affected cattle; but these tumours do not appear to be similar to the eruption that takes place in smallpox, but rather resemble the boils or buboes that take place in the plague and some other highly infectious fevers. On the whole, it seems to us pretty evident, that the disease is of the nature of putrid fever, and we have therefore ranked it under this head.\n\nIt appears from Camper's works, that inoculation was attended with so much success in many cases on the continent, that a great number of cattle was saved by it, who probably could not have been recovered from the natural disease. The advantages attending inoculation according to Camper are,\n\n1st. That we can expose to the danger of contagion such calves and heifers only as are of a moderate price.\n2nd. That the heifers pass through the disease before they take the bull, and consequently before they are pregnant. This is attended with more advantage than may appear at first sight; for when the contagion attacks a whole herd, all at once, oxen, calves, heifers, and cows are seized without distinction. Such cows as are pregnant generally slip their calf, and even if they should perfectly recover, their womb is so disordered that it will never afterwards be capable of retaining the calf; besides, that afterwards it is a long time before they come in heat, so that the proprietor is obliged to keep them for a whole year without deriving from them any benefit, except he fatten them for the butcher.\n\nIf the success of inoculation, as well as the certainty of the cattle being incapable of a second infection, were fully ascertained, the plan of inoculation would be extremely proper. If these points were fully established, would they not, however, militate considerably against the opinion that is entertained by the best writers on the subject, even by Camper himself, that this disease is an idiopathic putrid fever, and not an eruptive complaint like the smallpox?\n\nConsidering the disease as one that is highly contagious, every method should be taken to check the propagation of the infection. For this purpose the houses where the cattle are stabled, should be kept perfectly clean, and well ventilated. It would also be proper to fumigate these places twice a day with the vapours of some mineral acid, such as the nitrous or muriatic acids, as has been recommended by Dr Johnstone, Guyton Morveau, and Dr Carmichael Smith. This fumigation may be easily effected by placing pipkins of warm sand in various parts of the cattle-houses, and particularly at the doors, and placing on the sand a cup containing common salt or pounded nitre, on which is to be poured a sufficient quantity of sulphuric acid or oil of vitriol, stirring the mass now and then with a glass rod, to promote the escape of the acid vapours.\n\nWe shall conclude this subject with a series of queries that were circulated among medical men on the continent by the Society of Medicine at Paris, for the purpose of gaining every necessary information respecting this alarming pestilence, as they may tend to direct the inquiries of those who shall in future have an opportunity of observing the distemper.\n\n1. What is the situation of the country in which the epidemic appears, and what is the nature of the soil?\n2. Of what quality are the waters which the cattle usually drink, and of what dimensions are the reservoirs that contain them?\n3. What is the quality of the pasturage, and what are the plants which most constantly grow in the pastures?\n4. Of what nature is the fodder and the grain that are given to the cattle within doors?\n5. Have there been any abundant rains or inundations; has the water continued for a long time on the ground, and what are the effects it has produced on the fodder?\n6. Or has there on the contrary been any great drought, and how long has it continued?\n7. What has been the season for getting in the hay, and for harvest; and what effect does the season seem to have had on the hay and other fodder?\n8. What circumstances seem to have rendered it necessary for the cattle to work?\n9. Has the distemper been announced by any previous symptoms; and what were they?\n10. Did the disease come on with shivering, with coldness of the horns and ears, and with the loss of appetite?\n11. Did the heat come on soon after the cold fit, or was it not preceded by a cold fit?\n12. Do the animals continue lying, without being able to raise themselves on their legs?\n13. When they are lying, is their head low, or how do they hold it?\n14. Are their eyes red, watery, and hot?\n15. Are their nostrils dry, or does there ooze from them a mucous matter?\n16. Is their tongue in the natural state, or is it very red, or is it covered with a yellow or brown mucus; is it moist or dry, or are there on it any tubercles?\n17. Is their throat inflamed, or are there on it any aphthous crusts?\n18. Is the animal fatigued with a cough, and is this cough very frequent?\n19. Do the flanks heave or not?\n20. Does the animal seem to feel any great pain when he is touched in the flanks, or the belly, on the spine, or on the rump?\n21. Are there any pustules or tumours on the surface of the body?\n22. Is the hair smooth or staring, or does it easily come off when the skin is curried, or even when the body is rubbed with a wisp of straw?\n23. Does the animal seem much disordered, or does he refuse every sort of drink?\n24. Does he chew the cud?\n25. Has he a frequent discharge of urine, and what is the colour and consistence of it?\n26. Has he a discharge by stool more frequently or less than usual, and are the excrements natural, or very dry or very liquid; what is their colour and odour, and is their discharge preceded or accompanied with a frequent explosion of wind?\n27. Are there to be observed any little convulsions below the skin, especially about the neck?\n28. Is the belly in its natural state, or is it swelled; is it soft, or hard and tense?\n29. At what periods do these several circumstances take place?\n30. How does the distemper terminate; what are the symptoms that announce a healthy termination, and what are those which precede death?\n31. In what state after death are found the stomachs, the bowels, the liver, the spleen, the lungs, the heart, and the brain?\n32. What remedies have been administered to the diseased beast?\n33. What sensible effects have these remedies produced?\n34. Lastly, what regimen has been observed in the convalescent state?\n\nThe eruptive diseases incident to domestic animals are but few, when compared with the exanthemata that take place in the human body. Many such diseases are, however, described by veterinary writers, especially on the continent, where they seem to be much more prevalent than among us. In particular, it appears, that in the southern parts of Europe the sheep are frequently affected with an eruptive disease that nearly resembles the smallpox; and, like this disease in the human subject, there are two varieties of this affection, a distinct and a conuent. A very particular account of this disease, as it occurred at Cauterets in the department of the Lower Pyrenees in France, was drawn up by M. Tenon, and communicated by him to the agricultural society at Paris; and a translation of it has been published in the Farmer's Magazine for May 1804, from which we have taken it.\n\n3. Sheep-pox. Claveau, Fr.\n\nThis distemper, which at Cauterets is called the Sheep-pox, smallpox, is contagious; and indiscriminately attacks wethers, ewes, lambs, and goats, more especially when shut up during winter in confined cots, the animals are kept very hot. It is a very singular circumstance, that this distemper should only appear at Cauterets, after intervals of twelve, fifteen, or twenty years; while in Guienne, and the higher Languedoc, it rages every year. Besides, that in the former mountainous tracts, the weather is colder than in the plains of the latter districts, the sheep of the Pyrenees are kept more apart from each other than in the low countries, and the different flocks are much less liable to meet together, or to pass through the same roads, by which they are not nearly so much exposed to the danger of infection.\n\nWhen seized with this distemper, the sheep become dull and weak, and they loathe their food; the head, eyes, ears, and gums, are swelled; and hard white tumours appear in the groins and under the joint of the shoulder. Three or four days after the appearance of these tumours, pimples break out in different parts of the body. At first, these are situated on the naked skin between the thighs, and on the places where the wool is short and scanty; afterwards, they break out about the head, and successively over the whole body, even on the eye-lids, ears, and throat. In this stage of the disease the animal swallows with pain, being obliged to hold back the head, and to stretch out the neck for the purpose, and it breathes with great difficulty. As the disease goes on, the pimples enlarge, and become inflamed, particularly at their bases; they suppurate and burst; the matter which runs out mixes with the wool, and mats along with it into hard lumps, but afterwards dries and falls to powder; the wool falls off in locks; and even the scarf skin peels off in large pieces, which are full of holes. When the distemper begins to abate, the sheep rub themselves on the posts of the racks, or any other hard substance which comes in their way; and by this means the wool, along with the loose skin and dried pus, are rubbed off. If proper precautions were not employed, this would infallibly spread the contagion by infecting any other sheep that might be brought into the same cot; but, on purpose to destroy the infection, new cribs are either substituted for the old ones, which are pulled down and burnt, or else the infected cribs are washed with cream of lime, and the cribs are thoroughly fumigated with burning juniper and other aromatic plants.\n\nThere are several varieties of this disorder. In some of these the eruption of pustules is by no means complete as above described; sometimes the pimples grow black, and dry up without coming to suppuration; at other times the disease is of a complicated nature. But as the disorder only appears at distant periods among the sheep at Cauterets, we are not to expect very full information concerning its various degrees from the shepherds of that district; neither have they any decided experience of the effects of sulphur, or setons, or\nDiseases, or of blisters, in the cure of this distemper. Blisters are said to have scarcely any effect upon the skins of sheep.\n\nIt is certain, that the flesh of such sheep, as have died of this disorder, is very unwholesome, has a very bad taste, and is even dangerous to eat; and they add, that when dogs happen to feed on it, they catch the disease, and spread it by infection. Three cats, by eating this food, had their heads affected with an eruption of pustules, by which they were first blinded, and afterwards lost their lives. Hence the necessity of the precaution which is taken at Cauterets to bury deeply the carcases of sheep which die of this disease.\n\nI had an opportunity, says M. Tenon, at a butcher's in Paris, to examine some sheep which had died of this disorder. The skins were covered with suppurred pustules, which penetrated as far as the cellular membrane, and the fat in their neighbourhood was affected for a considerable distance all round, being browner and firmer than the ordinary fat; and this alteration penetrated even to the flesh.\n\nThe inhabitants of Cauterets affirm, that these pustules are found on the liver and other internal parts of the body.\n\nM. Tenon made every possible inquiry to learn whether this disease was ever communicated from the sheep to mankind, but he could learn no instances of such infection: it is believed, however, in Languedoc, that it is communicated from sheep to rabbits. He could not learn whether the sheep were ever affected a second time with the same disorder; but we cannot expect information at Cauterets on this part of the subject, since the disease only appears there for a single season, after intervals of twelve, fifteen, or twenty years, while the sheep live but eight, or at most, ten years; so that any of them, which have once been diseased, cannot be alive when the next period of contagion comes round.\n\nWhenever the disorder appears in the flock, the infected animals are separated from the rest, and shut up in warm cots, having plenty of wheat or barley straw given them for litter; they are fed with hay and aftermath which have been made on a dry field, with a little salt, and are allowed lukewarm water for drink.\n\nIn the flat country at Tarbes, which is ten leagues distant from Cauterets, and considerably warmer than in the Pyrenees, and where this distemper is much more frequent, a different method of treatment is followed. At the beginning of the disease blood is drawn by cutting the ear; the cots are fumigated for five or six successive days, by burning aromatic and strong-smelling herbs, preferring the dried stems of garlic for this purpose; these are burnt on a large stone in the middle of the cot, while all the vent holes are carefully stopped, to prevent, as much as possible, the smoke from escaping. The shepherds of Tarbes have great confidence in the beneficial effects of fumigating with garlic steams, which occasions a great discharge from the nostrils, especially in such cases of the disease as are complicated with catarrhal disorders, and with the staggers or vertigo.\n\nAt Bellegarde, near Auch, they give to each beast a double handful of white mulberry leaves, which they allege is a most effectual cure, and serves excellently for preventing the attacks of the disease.\n\nWhen, at Cauterets, the disorder begins to abate, whatever be the season of the year, the animals are clipped, on purpose to assist the drying of the pustules, and to favour the growth of a new fleece. After this the sheep fatten very quickly; and it is worth while to remark, that the fleece which immediately succeeds this disease is finer and more silky than any former or future fleece on the same beasts.\n\nFormerly this disease made great ravages among the sheep at Carcassonne, till a method was fallen on to inoculate the disease. M. Tenon learned this fact in 1762 from Dr French, an Irish physician, who lived in Languedoc for several years; but it was not till 1763 that he received particular information on this curious subject from M. Berra, mayor of Carcassonne, to whom he had written for information, and who procured him a memoir on the diseases of sheep in that part of the country. From this memoir the following account of inoculating the sheep-pox is extracted.\n\n\"The seigneur of Mauz, in the diocese of Narbonne is the first, and almost the only person who has practised inoculating the small-pox on his flocks; and having been successful during ten years experience of the practice, his widow has ever since continued to follow his example.\n\n\"In the month of September, when the heat of summer is past, and before there is any danger of very cold weather; while the pastures are still in good order, and the lambs, which are now six or seven months old, are strong enough for withstanding the force of the disease, this season is chosen as the fittest for communicating the small-pox to the sheep. For this purpose the fresh skin of a sheep, either ewe, wether, or lamb, which has died of the disease, or, instead of that, one taken from a sheep which has been killed while affected by it, is placed on the floor of the cot. Into this cot all the young sheep of the year are driven, and they voluntarily rub and roll themselves on the diseased skin. Very soon afterwards the symptoms of the disease begin to appear; they have a dull and heavy appearance, hold down their heads, are somewhat fevered, and loathe their food. On purpose to aid the eruption of the pustules, bread dipped in wine is given to the sheep; they are anxiously prevented from being exposed to great heat or great cold, and particularly from rain. By these precautions they speedily recover, and it very rarely happens that even one dies out of a flock of three hundred.\n\nAlthough the disorder has often spread over the districts in the neighbourhood of the estate where this practice prevails, there has been no instance of a single sheep, after undergoing the above described operation, having been infected a second time. It ought to have been noticed, that the inoculated flock is carefully prevented from mixing with any other sheep, by keeping it in a separate cot, and on a particular pasture, the other shepherds being forbidden to use either for the flocks under their charge. By these precautions, the disease is prevented from spreading, and such proprietors as do not wish to have their sheep artificially infected, have themselves to blame if they do not avoid the place where the diseased sheep are kept. Since this practice has been followed, it has been observed that the disorder has not returned so frequently, but that it has not proved\nDiseases proved in the least degree destructive to the flocks which have not been inoculated.\n\nM. Berra adds, that the lambs never lose their wool under the influence of the inoculated disorder, and that their fleeces are equally good in every respect with those of the uninfected, so that no difference can be perceived.\n\nThis disease was once pretty common in Britain, but is now scarcely known among us. It is, however, justly apprehended, that importation of sheep from the continent may again introduce it; and Sir Joseph Banks has taken much pains to caution the public against the danger of such an introduction.\n\n4. Cow-pox, or Kine-pox. Vaccina.\n\nA greater blessing was never procured to mankind than what has been already derived, and will we trust, be ultimately derived, from the invaluable discovery of the inoculated cow-pox, in preventing the person who has received it from being afterwards liable to various contagion. For this blessing we are certainly indebted to the labours and experiments of Dr Edward Jenner. There is no doubt that the disease was known many years ago in some of our principal dairy districts; but Dr Jenner has all the merit of having extensively circulated the discovery, and of having first applied it to those valuable purposes to which an almost universal experience has shown it to be well adapted.\n\nThe symptoms and origin of this disease amongst cows, have been briefly described by Dr Jenner in his publications on the subject. The first of these appeared in 1798, while Dr Jenner was practising in Berkely in Gloucestershire, where he had an opportunity of frequently seeing the disease.\n\n\"In this dairy country,\" says Dr Jenner, \"a great number of cows are kept, and the office of milking is performed indiscriminately by men and maid servants. One of the former having been appointed to apply dressings to the heels of a horse affected with the grease; and not paying due attention to cleanliness, inadvertently bears his part in milking the cows with some particles of the infectious matter adhering to his fingers. When this is the case, it commonly happens that a disease is communicated to the cows, and from the cows to the dairy maids, which spreads through the farm, until most of the cattle and domestics feel its unpleasant consequences. This disease has obtained the name of the cow-pox. It appears on the nipples of the cows in the form of irregular pustules. At their first appearance they are commonly of a palish blue, or rather of a colour somewhat approaching to livid, and are surrounded by an erysipelas inflammation. These pustules, unless a timely remedy be applied, frequently degenerate into phagedenic ulcers, which prove extremely troublesome. The animals become indisposed, and the secretion of milk is much lessened.\"\n\nThere sometimes appears another kind of eruption on the udder of the cow, which on a superficial view may be mistaken for cow-pox. It consists of a number of white blisters on the nipples, and these blisters are filled with a whitish serous fluid. They are to be distinguished from the pustules that take place in the cow-pox, by their not having the blueish colour of the latter, and by their never eating into the fleshy parts, being confined to the skin, and ending in scabs. This eruption also appears to be infectious, but not nearly in so great a degree as the true cow-pox.\n\nDr Jenner considers this spurious eruption as being chiefly produced by the transition which is made by the cow, in the spring, from a poor diet to one that is more nourishing, by which the udder at this season becomes more than usually vascular for the supply of milk. There is, however, another form of inflammation and pustules, which appears to be not uncommon in all the dairy counties in the west of England. A cow intended to be exposed for sale, and having naturally a small udder, is for a day or two previously neither milked by the milker, nor is her calf suffered to have access to her; thus the milk is paternally accumulated, and the udder and nipple become greatly distended. The consequences frequently are inflammation and pustular eruption.\n\nAs the eruption of the cow-pox disappears in a few days, little more is required than to keep the teats clean, in grease, and handle them as carefully as possible during milking.\n\nThe fact of cow-pox originating from the matter of grease, or of the latter being capable of producing the former, was, we believe, first discovered by Dr Jenner; but the opinion was for some time considered as fallacious. Many unsuccessful attempts were made by Dr Woodville and by Mr Coleman to produce cow-pox by inoculating the udders of cows with matter from greasy heels. Some experiments made by Mr Simmons tended still further to disprove Dr Jenner's opinion. But about five years ago, Dr John Loy published a pamphlet, in which he has related some experiments made by himself, with a view to determine this controversial point. He was led to make these experiments from some cases that fell under his observation, of a disease very similar to the cow-pox appearing on persons who must certainly have derived it from the matter of grease. Dr Loy's experiments fully confirmed the opinion of Dr Jenner, and proved that the matter of grease would, by inoculation, produce in the human body a disease exactly resembling cow-pox, and like it capable of protecting the inoculated person from an invasion of the smallpox. Dr Loy also proved, that in some cases, the cow-pox might be produced in cows by the immediate application of the matter of grease, but that this experiment did not succeed unless the horse had also a general affection of the system. This led Dr Loy to suppose that there exist two species of grease, the one merely a local affection, the other a general affection of the system.\n\nThe reasons that induced Dr Jenner to suppose that cow-pox originates in grease are thus stated by himself in his second publication on the subject of cow-pox.\n\nFirstly, He conceived grease to be the source of cow-pox, from observing that where the cow-pox had appeared among the dairies in Gloucestershire (unless it could be traced to the introduction of an infected cow or servant), it had been preceded at the farm by a horse labouring under grease, which horse had been attended by some of the milkers.\n\nSecondly, From its being a popular opinion throughout that dairy country, and from its being insisted on by those who there attend sick cattle.\n\nThirdly, From the total absence of the disease in Scotland and Ireland (as the doctor was informed from the best authority) where the men servants are not employed in the dairies.\n\nFourthly,\nFourthly, From having observed that morbid matter generated by the horse, frequently communicates in a casual way, a disease to the human subject so like the cow-pox, that in many cases it would be difficult to mark the distinction between the one and the other. The truth of this observation is well illustrated by the above experiments of Dr Loy.\n\nFifthly, From his being induced to believe from experiments, that some of those who had been thus infected by the horse, refitted the smallpox.\n\nSixthly, From the progress and general appearance of a pustule on the arm of a boy whom he inoculated with matter taken from the hand of a man that had been infected by a horse, and from the similarity to the cow-pox, of the general constitutional symptoms which followed.*\n\n5. LE LOUVET.\n\nContinental writers describe a variety of eruptions under the general name of charbon, or carbuncle, which affect various parts of the body, and have received different names according to the part which they attack. We shall here only notice one of these which raged epidemically about the middle of the last century in Switzerland, where it is called le Louvet.\n\nIt affected both cattle and horses, but seems to have been attended with different symptoms in each. According to M. Reynier, a physician at Lausanne, who published an account of the distemper, when an ox is seized with it, he suddenly loses his strength, trembles, seems delirious of lying constantly on the ground, whence he seldom moves except to refresh himself; he carries his head low, and his ears flouncing; he is sad, and moans; his eyes red, his skin very hot and dry, and his breathing frequent and difficult. When the disease has made some progress, expiration is always followed with a considerable depression of the flanks; there is a frequent cough; the breath is very fetid; the heart and arteries beat violently; the tongue and palate are dry and become blackish; the animal loses his appetite and ceases to chew the cud; there is considerable thirst; the urine is scanty, reddish, and the excrement hard and blackish towards the beginning of the disease, and sometimes limpid and bloody. Cows lose their milk. On most of the animals inflammatory tumours are produced, which appear sometimes on the chest, sometimes on the vertebrae of the neck, and on the belly; at others on the udder, and the parts of generation. At other times they entirely cover the skin in pimples, like those of the mange or scab.\n\nAll these symptoms do not often appear on the same subject; but in proportion as more of them occur, the disease is the more fatal. In general, death takes place on the fourth day, when the symptoms are violent; if they pass the fourth day, and are not worse on the seventh, their recovery is pretty certain, though they are often not convalescent before the fifteenth day.\n\nWhen the urine is turbid, and deposits a whitish sediment; when the excrements are more abundant than in the natural state, moist and not very offensive; when the skin is black and relaxed, the pimples filled with whitish matter, the thirst alleviated; when the appetite and rumination returns, and when the pustules begin to dry up, a perfect recovery may be expected; but on the contrary, when there is much swelling of the belly, when the animals moan much, when there appear great debility, tremblings, convulsions, retention of urine, diarrhoea or dysentery, a fatal termination may be looked for.\n\nOn opening the bodies of such animals as died of this disease, there appear on the skin numerous black tumours, full of a yellow furred fluid that effervesces with acids; the muscles are livid, soft and flaccid; the lungs swollen, full of tubercles and little ulcers, especially on those animals which died on the fourth day. The stomach and bowels are beset with red tumours, full of a tenacious clammy fluid.\n\nM. Reynier considers the predisposing causes of this disease to be the bad quality of the water which the beasts drank, the corrupted state of their food, excessive fatigue, low and ill-aired stables, deficiency of herbage, and tempestuous weather. Like many other medical men of his time, he held the immediate cause of the disease to consist in an alkaline state of the blood. The method of cure consisted in giving drenches of emollient decoctions, clysters of the same substances, with nitre and vinegar mixed with honey; and towards the latter stage of the disease, the Peruvian bark and camphor were administered. This was a very innocent and gentle treatment, and it is no wonder that so many of the cattle died.\n\n6. STRANGLES.\n\nThe disease called strangles in horses, is considered by Mr Blaine as a specific fever, accompanied with a disposition to inflammation in the glands of the head and throat. It most commonly attacks horses betwixt four and six years of age, though it may occur at any period before five; but rarely appears after that age. Young horses are most subject to it when first brought to labour, and put on the nourishing diet of the stable, though Mr Lawrence has seen it in unbroken colts in the field. It seems that few horses escape having it once in their life.\n\nIt commences with a considerable degree of fever; the breath is hot, the eyes are heavy and languid, the horse shrivels out his nose, has a hoarse cough, and labours under some difficulty in swallowing. There soon appears a swelling between the jaws, or on the inside of the lower jaw, which usually extends to the parotid glands. These swellings, if left to themselves, go on to suppuration; and about the fifth or sixth day they break and discharge a considerable quantity of matter; but sometimes the heat, hardness, and swelling of the glands continue for a long time. These symptoms are usually attended with a running at the nose, which is considered as a favourable sign.\n\nThis complaint is seldom dangerous, though now and then there is some risk of suffocation, and sometimes it degenerates into glanders. Of this Mr Lawrence has seen several instances. It appears to be contagious, and may be propagated by inoculation, which has induced us to consider it among the febrile eruptions.\n\nThe writers on farriery have strangely differed with respect to the nature of this affection. The elder Laflotte considered it as analogous to the smallpox. Bracken as a species of cynanche, or quinsy, and it certainly nearly resembles the cynanche parotidea, or mumps. Others have supposed it to be like the chickenpox, or measles.\n\nIt is not agreed on whether it is better to check the inflammation\ninflammation of the glands, or to encourage their suppuration. Mr Blaine recommends the former plan, which is best effected by bleeding, purging, and the use of diuretics; while a solution of sugar of lead is applied to the swelling externally; but if the swellings continue hard and hot, it will be proper to encourage suppuration by the frequent application of warm poultices. If there is much soreness and swelling of the throat, a large blister should be applied to it. If there is much fever, nitre or emetic tartar may be added to the horse's water; for it would be wrong to give him medicine in the form of a ball or drench. He may have frequent warm baths; and to encourage the running at the nose, there should be hung to it a bag containing a warm bath, which should be frequently renewed. The horse's head should be kept warm, and currents of cold air should be avoided. When the tumours break, the discharge should be assisted by enlarging the opening and applying warm poultices, and the ulcers may be dressed with the common digestive ointment. If the discharge proceeds by the mouth, the parts should be frequently washed with vinegar and water sweetened with honey.\n\n5. Grease. Eaux aux Jambes, Fr. Greasy heels.\n\nIn the fourth chapter of the last section, No. 423, we made a few observations on swelling of the legs, and we remarked that this complaint often terminated in grease.\n\nGrease is a complaint that is extremely common among horses, to whom it is peculiar, not being known to affect any other species of animals, or at least there is no other animal in whom that peculiar secretion which constitutes the matter of grease in horses is found to take place. There appears to be two varieties of grease, the one a mere local affection, the other a more general affection of the system attended with fever.\n\nThe complaint first appears by a slight swelling about the coronet and pattern, sometimes accompanied with pain or itching, so that the horse rubs his feet against each other, or stamps and shifts himself from side to side. On feeling the swollen part, it is commonly found much hotter than usual, and is evidently red and inflamed. Very soon there may be perceived an oozing through the skin, of a yellowish fluid that is very offensive, and of an unctuous greasy feel. This swelling gradually extends up the cannon towards the knee, and when the horse is taken out to work, he appears stiff and lame till he becomes heated; and when he returns from work, the leg appears hot and inflamed. The swelling and oozing of fetid greasy fluid gradually increase till cracks begin to make their appearance in the skin about the heels, the hairs about these parts fall off, and the skin below appears puffy, of a whitish or livid colour; and on it are generally seen little bladders, from which a matter of the same kind as what we have described oozes out. These vesicles soon become ulcers, and the matter they contain assumes the appearance of pus, which irritates and inflames the neighbouring parts, fretting and excoriating the skin. Generally a number of red granulations or excrescences appear within the ulcers, and from their form are commonly called grapes; and if the complaint continues long, the hoof becomes fungous, or there is a luxuriant growth of soft spongy horn.\n\nIf the complaint be neglected, the ulceration of the part increases, and extends even to the bones, which become soft, spongy, and at last carious.\n\nIn what is called the confirmed state of grease, the affected parts are exquisitely sensitive, and they bleed on the slightest touch, and there are commonly produced a number of horny excrescences about the fetlock. The hair stands erect, and the horse becomes lean, weak, and excessively irritable.\n\nSuch are the general appearances and progress of grease; but there are often some little varieties in both. Sometimes the cracks appear very early in the disease, and sometimes there is considerable fever; but whether this precedes the appearance of the vesicles, or is occasioned only by the pain and irritation that accompany the complaint, we are uncertain. It should seem, from the observations of Dr Loy and others, that a fever, such as accompanies eruptive diseases, frequently attends grease; and in this case, as we have said, it is to be considered as a general affection. It is described as such by Huzard, and other continental writers; and they even speak of the appearances that have been found on dissection of horses that have died when affected with this complaint, of the repercussion of the eruption from cold, &c. On the other hand, there is no doubt that fever may be excited by the irritation of the parts, especially if the horse is obliged to work. It may take place in any of the legs, but is more common in the hind legs.\n\nSuch horses as have round fleshy legs, such as have white hair upon their legs, and in general, such horses as are weak and phlegmatic, are more subject than others to grease.\n\nIt may be brought on by various causes. It is very commonly produced by allowing horses to stand long idle in the stable. In this way the circulation, which is naturally more languid in the legs, especially in the hinder legs, than in other parts of the body, becomes so languid in the heels, that the veins cannot readily propel forward their contents, and consequently an accumulation takes place in the minute capillary branches; whence swelling and inflammation. This accumulation is assisted by the perpendicular situation of the legs, by which a column of blood, that for want of the action of the muscles is moved with difficulty, continually presses on the lower parts. Hence we find, that when horses are not allowed to stretch themselves at their ease, they are extremely subject to swollen legs and grease. The languid circulation is still greater in horses that are naturally of a weak constitution, or who have been debilitated by disease. So great is the effect of diminished exercise in producing swollen legs and grease, that some horses are always affected with this complaint when brought into the stable, and can be preserved from it, only by being regularly turned out into the field after work. It is very commonly observed, that when horses first come up from pasture, or from a straw yard, they are all more or less affected with swollen legs; and if these are not diligently attended to, they soon have greasy heels. It is certain that horses in their natural state, or while kept constantly at pasture, are never affected with grease.\n\nSudden changes from heat to cold, or vice versa, frequently produce this complaint; but, according to Mr Feron, it is more commonly produced by sudden changes\nchanges from cold to heat. \"If (says he) a colt is taken from grass, and immediately kept in a warm stable, after having been used to the severity of the atmosphere, he then gets the disorder. When old horses are troubled with the grease, we shall find that their feet have been exposed first to cold, and afterwards to heat, as when they have been in cold water or snow for a long time; and on coming into the stable have a large bed of straw, or perhaps hot dung, to stand upon. This sudden transition from cold to heat, produces a weakness in the legs, particularly in the skin; when inflammation and cracks, similar to chilblains in the human subject, take place, and are called the grease in horses.\"\n\nNothing contributes more to the production of grease than negligence, with respect to keeping the legs clean, and rubbing them often. It is a disputed point, whether the hair that grows about the fetlock is prejudicial or not to horses that are subject to grease. It is contended by Mr Richard Lawrence, that grease is a very common consequence of removing the hair; and considering that the hair is a good preservative against sudden transitions from heat to cold, we are disposed to think its removal improper, where the heels are not already ulcerated. On the other hand, Mr Blaine remarks, that whenever accidental wet occurs, this hair must retain a large quantity of it, and hence be long in drying, occasioning a copious evaporation, and thus producing much cold, and that the hair renders it difficult to keep the legs to clean, as they might be preserved without it. Even supposing these arguments to be just, they only show the necessity of greater care and attention in rubbing the heels dry and keeping the hair free from dirt.\n\nGrease may also be produced by too much hard work, after which the legs swell, and if the swelling be neglected the heels may become greasy. This, however, is probably not a very common cause.\n\nGrease is said to be most common in spring and autumn, when horses are moulting or casting their coats.\n\nOn the whole, it appears that this complaint may take place in two different states of the body; a state of general weakness, the effect of constitution or disease; and a state of plethora, attended with a proportional languid circulation in the vessels of the legs or feet.\n\nIn the treatment of grease, we must consider whether it be merely a local affection, or be connected with some general morbid affection of the body; and we must also attend to the state of the affection, as the nature of the local applications will depend much on the progress that the disease has made.\n\nIn the early stage of the complaint, when the inflammation is slight, and the skin is not yet broken, if it has been owing to want of exercise and plethora, it may be proper to draw blood from the veins of the thighs, and a diuretic bath, such as No. 12. or 13., should be given, and repeated every two or three days. The hair must be cut close, and the heels well washed with warm soap and water, after which they must be gently rubbed till they are perfectly dry, and bathed with some stimulating liniment. This plan, with gentle exercise and a cooling diet, especially bran mash, with an ounce of nitre in each, every night, will probably prevent the complaint from going any farther. If the inflammation be very considerable, and the horse is plethoric, he must be bled pretty largely from the jugular vein, and have a mild purge. Cloths, dipped in vinegar and water, or in a solution of sugar of lead, should be applied to the heels after washing, and kept constantly moist with the same liquor. More than walking exercise here will be improper; but if it is dry weather, a run for a few hours a day in a field will greatly contribute to removing the swelling. Mr Feron, who is a great advocate for warm fomentations in inflammatory affections of the feet and legs, recommends the legs to be kept the whole day in warm water; and when they are taken from the bath, to be well wrapped up in a warm poultice of bran and water. If by these means the inflammation subsides, the legs may be washed with a solution of alum.\n\nIf cracks appear, great attention must be paid to keep them clean from dirt, and they should be frequently washed with a solution of blue vitriol. If grapes appear, they may be touched with blue vitriol, or burnt alum; or if they become large, they must be cut away with a sharp knife, and afterwards seared with a hot iron. If the ulcers are foul, one of the best applications will be a solution of verdigris, or the ointment commonly called Egyptianum, of which verdigris forms one of the principal ingredients.\n\nThe strictest attention to diet, regimen, and cleanliness, must be observed during the whole treatment, and gentle exercise must be persisted in. The best diet on these occasions will be cut grass, lucerne, fresh clover, carrots, or good sweet hay, and an occasional feed of corn. The horse should not be tied up in the stall, but should stand loose while he is in the stable, and should be allowed no litter, except at night. The stable should be kept perfectly clean and well aired, and not too warm.\n\nSometimes, even though the complaint should not at first have originated in debility, there will, if the disease is of long standing, be produced a considerable degree of weakness. In these cases the cure will be greatly assisted by giving strengthening remedies, such as bark, horse-chestnut bark, &c. And as in this weak state of the body the discharge from the ulcerated surface is commonly thin and ichorous, the fore must be dressed with stimulating ointment; and if there appears a tendency to mortification, as sometimes happens, a powder of equal parts of Peruvian bark and opium should be sprinkled on the sores, before applying the plaster. If the discharge is very offensive, a fermenting poultice, such as No. 64., may be applied over the dressings.\n\nIt will readily appear, that the best means of preventing grease, will be to give the horse regular exercise, to dress him well, and especially to keep his legs dry and clean, and to avoid the extremes of heat and cold.\n\nGrease might perhaps have been considered under the head of specific inflammation; but as it is sometimes attended with a general affection of the body, and is ultimately connected with one of the most interesting eruptive diseases, we thought it best to treat of it in this place.\nChap. II. Of Inflammatory Diseases.\n\n1. Inflammation of the Brain. Phrenitis. Mad Staggers, Phrenzy, Megrim, or Sough. Mal de feu ou d'Espagne, Fr.\n\nThis is one of the most serious and fatal inflammations which affect the animal system. It attacks occasionally all the domestic animals, but horses and cattle are the most subject to it. In the former it is generally called the mad staggers, to distinguish it from apoplexy, or sleepy staggers; when it occurs in cattle, it usually takes one of the other names which we have given as synonyms.\n\nInflammation of the brain is sometimes preceded by giddiness and partial blindness; the animal holds his head low, or rests it against the manger; he appears dull, heavy, and sleepy; gradually, however, these symptoms go off, and are succeeded by others of a very different nature. His eyes appear red, fiery, and sparkling; he now holds his head higher, and appears for some time to look constantly at any object before him; soon he becomes very restless, till by degrees he is quite unmanageable. He sometimes lies down, and tumbles about, and then remains quiet for a while; but he soon gets up again, and is as ungovernable as before, rendering it dangerous for any person to approach him. The pulse in this disease is full and hard, and there is considerable throbbing of the temporal arteries. The pulse is not always the same in every case, being in general less frequent than in health, but sometimes more so. There is always a considerable degree of fever, and the head seems peculiarly affected. The secretions and excretions are generally diminished, but it is said that they are sometimes increased.\n\nSuch are the symptoms as they generally appear in the horse; those which take place in cattle, as they are described in the best books on the subject of cattle medicine, differ in a few particulars.\n\nThe animal is described as looking frightfully, being unusually watchful, starting often, groaning vehemently, as if affected with sudden and violent pain; his respiration flows, but he sometimes makes very long inspirations, and appears for a time as if his breathing was entirely suspended. Suddenly the beast will rise, turn about, and instantly lie down again, showing marks of great restlessness and delirium. When the frenzy is high, the eyes look red and furious; at other times they border on languor and stupefaction; but the beast always appears to labour under considerable fear, and dreads the approach of everything; he is often quite ungovernable, and scarcely ever inclines to rest, except in the latter stage of the disease, when, if it has been neglected, or has not yielded to the usual remedies, a lethargy takes place, and the animal sinks. Sometimes the urine is hot and high-coloured; but it is said that before a fit of phrenzy takes place, the urine is often of a pale colour, and thinner than natural.\n\nWhen the symptoms of fury or irritation suddenly cease, and a lethargy takes place, while the pulse becomes feeble, and the strength diminishes, the case is pretty certainly hopeless; but if the fever, redness, and flushing of the eyes gradually subside, without the pulse sinking, or great debility coming on, the beast may generally be pronounced recovering.\n\nOn opening the head of such animals as have died of this complaint, very evident marks of inflammation appear about the membranes of the brain, and very frequently in the substance of the brain itself. All the vessels are turgid with blood; and on cutting into the brain, innumerable little red points are to be seen, which do not appear in the natural state. Very commonly an effusion of blood, or of purulent matter, is found to have taken place into the cavities of the brain, or in some part near its surface.\n\nThe causes of inflammation of the brain are generally the same that produce inflammatory fever, applied in a greater degree; as great heat, excessive exercise, a sudden change from a poor to a rich diet.\n\nThe cure of this complaint requires the most prompt and decisive measures. Blood must be taken in large quantities from the jugular vein or temporal artery. Not less than three quarts should be taken from an ordinary horse, ox, or cow; and if the animal is very large, four may be taken; and the bleeding must be repeated a few hours after, if the symptoms do not abate. When the beast is very furious, it is often dangerous to bleed in a very deliberate way; but as his recovery will almost certainly depend on a sufficient loss of blood in the early part of the disease, it will not be amiss to bleed him in the manner described by Mr Blaine, as having been practised by an eminent veterinary surgeon, who being called to a horse affected with staggers, and in such a state of delirium that none of the ordinary precautions for securing him could be adopted, plunged a lancet into each jugular, and permitted the animal to bleed till he fainted, by which means, though the disease was far advanced, he saved the horse. After bleeding, a stimulant blister should be applied to the top of the head, and the sides of the neck should be well rubbed with a mixture of powdered cantharides and oil of turpentine, and other means used to promote external inflammation, for the purpose of determining the blood from the head. Mr Coleman is said to recommend in these cases the pouring of boiling water on the pasterns, by which means blistering will speedily be produced in those parts. In desperate cases the determination of blood to the head may be most effectually stopped, by tying a ligature about one of the external carotid arteries; but in doing this great care must be taken not to include within the ligature the nerves that run near the artery, as these nerves are the principal branches that supply the stomach; and if they be included in the ligature, the functions of that organ will be in a great measure destroyed. In addition to these means collyreous must be carefully guarded against. After back-raking, a stimulating purging clyster should be injected as soon as possible, and if an interval of quiet will permit, a purging ball, such as No. 15, may be given by the mouth. If the above means are adopted in proper time, the animal will generally be saved; but if some days have elapsed before vigorous steps are taken, there can be little hope of a cure.\n\nMr Downing, in his work on cattle-doctoring, mentioned in No. 87, advises a method of treating inflammation of the brain in cattle, that is extremely contradictory and inconsistent. He at first very properly advises bleeding; but he directs this to be followed by giving diapente, a very powerful cordial medicine, the administration of which completely counteracts the effects of the bleeding. Dr Downing describes a fever of the\nbrain as distinct from inflammation; and he then treats of a sleepy fever. These are evidently symptomatic affections, and should have been given as such, as well as guidelines, or swimming in the head, which is described by Dr Downing \"as a distemper belonging to the cavities of the eyes and optic nerves. It gives a wavering motion to the body. For if the optic nerve, or its expansion on the bottom of the eye called retina, be agitated by any supernatural heat or other emotion, objects will change their situation; therefore, this disease is a fever affecting the cavities of the eyes, or the optic nerves.\"\n\n2. Inflammation of the Eye. Ophthalmia Membranarum.\n\nThough in the human subject there are several species of ophthalmia, in the horse there is but one, which is in a great measure synonymous to what has been called ophthalmia membranarum by medical writers. This disease in the horse is of considerable importance, as it is not merely a local disease, but appears to be connected with some constitutional affection. Before we describe the symptoms and treatment of this complaint, it will be proper to remark, that in the eye of the horse there is a firm cartilaginous substance, situated at the inner corner of the eye, the greater part of which is hidden by the eyelids, but a small portion projects beyond them, and may be distinguished by its black colour. This is commonly called the haw, and by anatomists the membrana nictitans, and is supposed to be a production of the retractor muscle. Our reason for mentioning this part will appear immediately.\n\nInflammation of the eye sometimes makes its appearance very suddenly; at others it is gradual in its attack. In general, one of the earliest symptoms of it is a swelling of the eyelids, especially of the upper, which is with difficulty held open; the eyes water considerably, and drops of tears may be seen at the extremity of the lacrimal duct, which do not appear in the healthy state of the eye. The external transparent parts of the eye become discoloured and obscured, appearing of a blackish glairy hue; sometimes of a dull white, at others brown or bluish. Red vessels may be seen running over the white of the eye, especially at the corners, and sometimes reaching to the centre of the eye. The cornea is said to be most obscured on its upper part; but this is probably owing to the situation of the person who looks at the eye, who being below it, sees directly through the lower part of the cornea, and but obliquely through the upper. When the eyes are in this state, the horse is very impatient of light, and holds his head down to guard against it. The eyelids and ball of the eye are evidently much hotter than usual, and sometimes there may be seen through the cornea, a small quantity of thickish matter like pus, in the lower part of the anterior chamber of the eye. The cartilaginous membrane or haw is now much more visible, and projects forward considerably outward from the corner of the eye.\n\nIt not unfrequently happens, when the disease has not proceeded farther than we have described, that it gradually, sometimes pretty suddenly, disappears, and is seen again in the course of a few weeks, although sometimes it comes back in the course of a few days. The disappearance of inflammation in the eye of the horse is sometimes so sudden, that the eye, which one day is considerably inflamed, will appear the next perfectly clear and healthy. Sometimes it seems to appear and disappear periodically; and it has been supposed by ignorant people, that in these periods it follows the changes of the moon, whence it has received the name of lunatic blindness. If the disease does not thus disappear, or if it appears again, and reaches the height before described, the inflammation goes on, and the cornea becomes more obscure; or, what very frequently happens, the cornea recovers its transparency, and the crystalline humour becomes opaque, forming the disease already spoken of in No. 325.\n\nIn the horse, one eye frequently only is affected, whereas in man, both eyes are generally inflamed at the same time. This disease more frequently occurs in young horses of five or six years old, than in those of a more advanced period. It is said that horses are never affected with inflammation of the eyes till they are broken, or taken up from the pasture where they have remained from their birth.\n\nA plethoric state of the body seems very much to predispose to inflammation of the eye, and this seems to account for its occurring so frequently in horses of five or six years old, as at that age they generally cease to grow, and are, of course, more dilated than at other times to fulness of blood. Sudden changes of temperature form a very common exciting cause of this disease, and the heat and foul air of a close stable frequently produce it. Such horses as are kept in dark stables are also more subject to it, from the effect of sudden exposure to broad day-light. Want of exercise, or extremes of idleness and hard work, may also assist in producing it. Mr Coleman considers this disease in the horse as an inflammation of a specific nature, very different from any that occurs in other animals. The principal reasons for supposing that the constitution is affected are, that a horse affected with an inflammation of the eye either does not perspire, or sweats profusely, indicating a slow fever. If the animal is bled or purged, the eye speedily becomes clear; and if the same causes are applied, the same eye, or more commonly the other, becomes inflamed, and sometimes the disease appears alternately in each eye.","sp":118,"ep":156},{"h":"THE FEMININE GENDER IS THAT WHICH","t":"e feminine gender is that which denotes the noun or name to belong to a female. In the Latin, the feminine gender is formed of the masculine, by altering its termination; particularly by changing us into ae. Thus,\nThus, of the masculine *bonus equus*, \"a good horse,\" is formed the feminine *bona equa*, \"a good mare;\" so, of *parvus homo*, \"a little man,\" is formed *parva feminina*, \"a little woman,\" &c.\n\nIn French, the feminine gender is expressed, not by a different termination, but by a different article: thus, *le* is joined to a male, and *la* to a female.\n\nIn English, we are generally more strict, and express the difference of sex, not by different terminations, nor by different particles, but different words; as boar and sow, boy and girl, brother and sister, &c.\u2014though sometimes the feminine is formed by varying the termination of the male into *-ess*; as in abbot, abbess, &c.","sp":207,"ep":208},{"h":"THE OPENING IS MADE BY","t":"e opening is made by means of a sharp-pointed instrument with an eye at the other end for receiving the cord. The sides of the instrument must be proportioned to the opening to be made, and the size of the cord to be inserted.\n\nSetons are particularly useful for the purpose of gradually draining off matter from abscesses or suppurating tumours, that are either so deeply seated as not to be easily opened in any other way, or so large that the sudden discharge of matter from them while opened by the knife, would be attended with bad consequences. They are best employed in large abscesses of the back withers, and the upper part of the neck behind the ears. Setons are also attended with the advantage of draining off the matter without exposing the inside of the abscess to the air.\n\nThe method of inserting the seton for the purpose of opening an abscess is this. When it is found that there is a considerable accumulation of matter, the needle, furnished with a cord of the proper size, is to be introduced at the highest part of the tumour, and brought out towards its lowest part, so that the matter may more easily drain off. The cord, which must previously be rubbed with stimulating ointment, is now to be cut from the eye of the needle, and then fastened together at both ends, to prevent its being pulled out; but if the cord should not admit of being thus tied, a small Operation button of wood may be fastened on each end. It is better, however, if possible, to tie the ends together, as every time the fore is dressed, the seton requires to be drawn a little round. When the discharge appears to be nearly stopped, except what evidently arises from the presence of the cord, this may be gradually removed, by drawing out a single thread of it at every dressing.\n\nIn introducing the needle, great care must be taken to avoid large blood-vessels and nerves; and where there is a danger in encountering these, it is better to pass the needle through a sheath. This may easily be done, by first making a small opening with a lancet at the upper part of the tumour; and through this introducing the sheath, which is to be pushed down till it reaches the part at which the needle is intended to come out. The needle in this way will pass through the sheath without danger of wounding any important nerve or vessel.\n\nCHAP. V. Of Firing.\n\nThis operation consists in applying to the skin, or firing other parts of the body, a metallic instrument heated to a greater or lesser degree of redness. The instrument is called a cautery, and the operation was well known among the ancient surgeons, by the name of the actual cautery.\n\nThe instruments employed for firing are usually made of iron, sometimes of copper; but iron is to be preferred. They are of various forms, according to the part to which they are to be applied, and the purpose for which the operation is to be performed. These will be considered in describing the cases to which firing is applicable.\n\nThe operation is found of use on several occasions:\n\n1st. In order to oppose the progress of mortification. With this view a cautery shaped like a knife, with a blunt edge and a thick back, is to be employed. This form will also answer for many other cases. There should be several instruments of the same kind, that when one becomes too cool, another may be ready of the proper degree of heat. The heat of the iron intended for the present case should be that of a cherry-red. In applying the iron, the parts adjoining to the mortified place are to be passed over with the edge of the instrument in successive parallel lines, so as the heat may penetrate to the living parts, and thus produce such a degree of healthy action as may enable them to throw off the mortified flesh. When the iron has been applied for a sufficient time, which must be regulated by the nature of the part, and the extent of mortification, the wound is to be covered with a pledget spread with some stimulating ointment.\n\n2d. Firing is employed to brace the skin, and to strengthen the sinews. The instrument above described is used on this occasion, but its heat must be somewhat greater. The mode of applying it is to pass the edge lightly and quickly over the skin, describing parallel lines from one end of the part to the other. When one iron has been used in this way, a fresh one is to be taken, and made to retrace the lines first formed, beginning where the last iron left off; and this is to be repeated as often as appears necessary, taking care not to destroy the texture of the skin. It is recommended\nPart III.","sp":58,"ep":59},{"h":"THE SMALL PATTERN-JOINT IS ALSO WELL SECURED BY","t":"e small pattern-joint is also well secured by means of ligaments, and by the sheath of the flexor-tendon. There are also ligaments proceeding from the fetamoid bones, which enter the sheath of the flexor-tendon, and are attached to the small pattern-joint. (a, a, a, fig. 16.)\n\n\"The weight which the fetamoid bones, by means of ligaments sustain, is very different in different horses; and bears no proportion to the bulk and weight of the animal. The pattern joints of large horses destined for slow motion, are constructed very differently from those...\"\nPart II.\n\nAnatomy of blood horses. Their pattern bones are short, and the joints nearly straight; but thorough-bred horses of light weight have long and very oblique pattern joints; and, as in proportion to the obliquity of the large pattern, or fetlock joint, the canon conveys more of the weight to the sesamoid bones, the ligaments that support the sesamoids are necessarily put into motion, and more on the stretch, as the weight presses down the lower and back part of the canon on the sesamoid bones. Short pattern joints are as much adapted to the frame of heavy horses as longer joints are to that of lighter horses. The ligaments that support the sesamoids above also contribute to assist the flexor muscles and tendons in preserving when at rest, and in motion, the large pattern-joint in its proper place.*\n\nBefore we proceed in describing the structure of the hoof, it will be proper to shew how the hoof is formed, and how it is connected with the parts within.\n\nThe hoof of the horse forms a sort of organized shoe, which is adapted to the foot with the greatest nicety; so that every part of the cavity is completely filled, without the foot's being subjected to any unequal pressure.\n\nA correct knowledge of the natural form and structure of this part of the horse's foot, and of the deformities produced in it by improper treatment, is of the utmost importance; as on this must depend the most advantageous method of shoeing, and the only rational means of correcting the unnatural deviations. It will be obvious, that, in order to form a just idea of the original shape of the hoof, we must examine it before any shoe has been applied to it; for, unless this shoe has been so constructed and fitted to the foot, as to preserve unaltered the original form of the hoof, this will be so changed, that we cannot recognize from it what was the original shape. That the methods of shoeing usually employed are calculated rather to deform the hoof, than to preserve its original figure, will appear presently.\n\nA vertical section of the hoof shows it to be nearly conical; the broadest part of the cone being next the ground. This inferior surface, in a hoof that has not been shod, especially in the fore foot, appears nearly circular; or the diameter, from side to side, is nearly equal to the diameter from toe to heel, (see fig. 17.)\n\nThe hoof is composed of a horny substance that is entirely without sensation. It is divided into crust, sole, frog, and bars.\n\nThe crust surrounds the foot on the fore part, and on the sides, like a wall (A, A, fig. 17.) It grows obliquely downwards from the coronet, and becomes broader as it approaches the ground. It is thicker at the toe, than at the quarter; and the outer quarter is thicker than the inner. On the outside it is smooth and rounded, but within hollow and laminated (B B, fig. 15.) to unite with the coffin-bone. The crust is the only part into which nails can with safety be driven in shoeing.\n\nThe horny sole (B B, fig. 17.) unites with the lower part of the crust, and is situated below the coffin-bone; but between it and the coffin-bone, there is a vascular substance to be presently described, called the sensible sole, from the blood-vessels of which the horny sole is formed. On the outside next the ground, the horny sole is hollow, but rounded within next the coffin-bone. The horny sole protects the sensible sole from injury, and in the horse's motions it embraces the ground, acting as a stop. When the laminated substances of the hoof lengthen, the horny sole defends, and thus affords in preventing concussion.\n\nThe bars, or binders, (C C, fig. 17.) are two horny Bars. Substances placed between the sole and the frog, and forming at the heels a close solid union with the crust. The small part of the bars called the toe, sometimes reaches almost as far as the toe of the frog. Within the frog, the bars are laminated like the inner part of the crust, and are closely united to the horny sole. The bars on the outside keep the horse's foot extended, and within, they tend to prevent the separation of the sensible sole from the horny sole. In the natural state of the hoof, there is a considerable cavity between the bars and the frog on each side.\n\nThe frog (D D, fig. 17.) is that hard, rounded protuberance, which we observe in the middle of the lower part of the hoof, pointed towards the toes, and expanded towards the heel like a wedge. In the middle of this broad part, there is a fissure (E, fig. 17.) The external frog is united within the hoof to a narrow substance of a similar shape, but of a more elastic structure, and possessing sensation, and therefore called the sensible frog. This substance is connected above with the navicular bone, towards the back part; and at the extremity of the heels, it is united with cartilages on each side. The toe of the sensible frog is united to the coffin-bone, but by far the greater part is behind this bone. The back part of the frogs being united with elastic and moveable substances, admit of considerable motion, the frog rising when the hoof touches the ground, and descending when the foot is raised. By the ascent of the frog, the heels are prevented from contracting, and the cartilages are expanded, so as to afford the horse a considerable spring, whilst the form of this part fits it for embracing the ground, and thus prevents the horse from slipping. The convex form of the frog clearly shows that it was always intended to touch the ground, and experience has fully proved, that, unless this contact takes place, the healthy state of this organ cannot be preserved. It has been supposed that the frog is intended to defend the principal tendon or back ligament; but Mr Coleman has shown that this is a mistake.\n\nThe weight of the horse is chiefly supported by the weight of crust, and not by the sole or frog; for when these parts have been removed, or by being diseased, become soft and porous, and thus incapable of resistance, it is found the sole and that the crust is still competent to bear the whole of the frog's weight. If the sole and frog really supported the weight, it is evident that when these parts are removed or diseased, the foot would slip through the crust.\n\nThe union of the sensible frog with the horny frog, and the connection thus formed between the sides of the frog's sensible frog, and the lower cartilages, effectually prevents dislocation. When the horny frog touches the ground, both that and the sensible frog ascend; but when by any means the horny frog is prevented from pressing on the ground, its proper functions are suspended. The cartilages partake of the motion of the frog; and, in proportion as this receives pressure, they recede from each other, and allow the sensible frog to ascend between them. But when the cartilages are rendered immovable by becoming bony, or by contraction of the\nthe foot, the sensible frog is much confined in its motion. By this immobility of the cartilages, the horse is deprived of a powerful spring. When the frog does not press on the ground, and consequently the cartilages are deprived of motion, the moisture of the crust evaporates; and hence the quarters and heels of the hoof become contracted much more than the fore part of the crust, and this contraction is increased by the frog not being allowed to rise between the cartilages. Thus, the natural circular shape of the hoof is destroyed by the frog not receiving pressure.\n\nFig. 18 represents the lower part of a horse's hoof, as it is usually lengthened or contracted by improper shoeing.\n\nWe have not yet described the sensible sole. This is situated between the horny sole and the coffin-bone, and is united to the lower cartilages immediately behind the latter (C C, fig. 15). Its lower edge is firmly connected with the sensible laminae, at the lower edge of the coffin-bone; but at the extremity of the heels, the laminae are continued for about an inch, forming what are called the sensible bars. The sensible sole is well supplied with blood-vessels, but when these are emptied, it appears of a ligamentous texture. From the vessels of this part, the horny matter of the horny sole and bars is formed and renewed.\n\nThe only other part of the foot that we shall describe, is an important ligament, which surrounds the junction of the coffin-bone with the hoof, and is called the coronary ligament, (D D, fig. 16.) This ligament is attached at its upper part, to the anterior protuberance of the coffin-bone, and to the lateral cartilages; and extends a little above the coffin joint, being united on its outside to the skin. Below it is united to the sensible laminae, at their origin. On its outside it is convex, and is received into a correspondent hollow in the crust, called the coronary ring. It is ultimately inserted into the heels of the sensible frog. The uses of this ligament are very important. By its union with the sensible laminae, lateral cartilages, sensible frog, and coffin-bone, it affords the action of all these parts, increasing their strength and connection; and in particular, preserves the proper situation of the cartilages, and prevents their being dislocated, to which they would otherwise be liable, by being separated by the rising of the sensible frog between them, when the horny frog touches the ground.\n\nWe have thus described the structure and functions of the foot and hoof, as far as appeared to us to be absolutely necessary for understanding the principles and practice of shoeing. The names, insertions, and uses of the muscles of the foot, have been already concisely given in the table of the muscles of the extremities (see page 437.) The blood-vessels, nerves, and absorbents are well described, and most beautifully figured in Mr Coleman's elegant work on the structure, economy, and diseases of the foot of the horse; to which, and to Mr Freeman's work on the same subject, we refer such of our readers as wish for a complete and accurate account of that curious and important piece of mechanism, the foot of the horse.\n\nWe shall conclude this chapter with a summary recapitulation of the more important circumstances that have been mentioned, as we shall immediately apply them in describing the most approved method of shoeing; and they will be the better understood, and the more easily remembered, by being brought together in a comprehensive point of view. It appears then,\n\n\"That the natural form of the hoof of the fore feet of horses, before any art has been employed, approaches to a circle; and,\n\n\"That the internal cavity of the hoof, when circular, is completely filled by the sensible parts of the foot.\n\n\"That the hoof is composed of horny insensible fibres, that take the names of crust, sole, bars, and frog.\n\n\"That the crust is united with the last bone of the foot, by a number of laminated elastic substances.\n\n\"That the uses of the laminae are to support the weight of the animal, and from their elasticity to prevent concussion.\n\n\"That the horny sole is externally concave, internally convex, and united by its edge with the inferior part of the crust.\n\n\"That the uses of the horny sole are to act as a spring, by descending at the heels; to preserve the sensible sole from pressure, and (with its concavity) to form a convexity of the earth.\n\n\"That the external bars are nothing more than a continuation of the crust, forming angles at the heels.\n\n\"That the internal bars are a continuation of the laminae of the crust, attached to the horny sole at the heels within the hoof; and that these insensible laminae are intimately united with sensible laminated bars, connected with the sensible sole.\n\n\"That the use of the external bars, is to preserve the heels expanded; and the use of the internal horny bars, to prevent separation and dislocation of the horny sole from the sensible sole.\n\n\"That the external frog is convex, and of an insensible horny elastic nature.\n\n\"That the internal sensible frog is of the same form, very highly elastic, and united with two elastic cartilages.\n\n\"That the frogs are not made to protect the tendon, as Mr St Bel and other writers have supposed.\n\n\"That the use of the frog is to prevent the horse from slipping, by its convexity embracing the ground; and from the elasticity of the sensible and horny frogs they act as a spring to the animal, and keep expanded the heels.\"*\nPART III. OF THE OPERATIONS USUALLY PERFORMED ON DOMESTIC ANIMALS.\n\nCHAP. I. Of Shoeing.\n\nThe principles and practice of shoeing are usually explained at the end of treatises on the veterinary art, immediately after describing the usual surgical operations. We think it better, however, to treat on the subject of shoeing in this part of our article, immediately after having described the anatomy of the horse's foot; the necessity of understanding which has been fully explained in the last chapter.\n\nIt is very uncertain at what period mankind first began to shoe their horses with iron; but it is probable that this practice commenced as soon as they were sufficiently civilized, to have such roads as were composed of solid, hard materials, fitted for the purposes of constant traffic. In many countries where such kind of roads are not required, as in the deserts of Arabia, and in many eastern countries, we know that to this day the horses are not shod; and we have been assured, that some years ago, when the roads in most of the United Provinces of America were not so hard as they are at present, horses were shod only on the forefeet (D).\n\nWe shall first briefly describe the mode of shoeing commonly practised by the smiths of this country, and shall then give a short account of the most important improvements that have been made in the art, from the time of Lafole to the present method employed at the veterinary college.\n\nIn the common mode of shoeing, the bars are totally cut away, and the frog is considerably pared down, by means of a cutting instrument called a butteris. The method of reason assigned for cutting away the bars, or opening the heels, as it is called, is, that the heels may not contract, and that the shoe may not press upon the sole, and occasion corns. The hoof being thus prepared, the shoe is to be applied. The common form of this shoe is nearly elliptical, being broader at the fore part, and growing narrower towards the heels, where it is thicker than at the toe. It is convex on its outer surface where it is to touch the ground, and concave on its inner part, which is applied next the hoof. It is fastened to the hoof by means of eight nails, four in each quarter; and the heads of these nails are nearly cubical, standing out a little beyond the shoe. This shoe is commonly applied nearly red-hot, in order, as we suppose,\n\n(d) Attempts have been made to prove that the ancients understood the use of iron shoes, and passages have been quoted both from Greek and Roman writers to support this assertion. But we think that the learned Beckman has fully demonstrated the fallacy of this opinion, and has shown, that although leathern shoes were sometimes employed on the feet of horses and other beasts of burden, the use of iron horse-shoes was entirely unknown both to the Greeks and Romans. Indeed, if such shoes were in use among them, the ancient authors who have treated on horsemanship, husbandry, and the veterinary art, as Xenophon, Julius Pollux, Columella, and Vegetius, could not possibly have omitted to notice them. It cannot be supposed that these writers would have been silent with respect to the shoeing of horses, when they treat so particularly of the breeding and rearing of these animals, and prescribe remedies for the accidents and diseases to which they are subject.\n\nBeckman is of opinion that iron horse-shoes were used in Europe as early as the ninth century, for in the works of the emperor Leo, who lived about that period, they are expressly mentioned by the name of \u03c3\u03b9\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b9\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b1. The emperor also speaks of horse-shoe nails by the appellation of \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2, and mentions that a certain number of pounds of iron should be given out from the imperial stores to make \u03c3\u03b9\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1, and other horse furniture. The antiquity of horse-shoes is also confirmed by their being spoken of in the writings of Italian, French, and English authors of the same century. \"When Boniface marquis of Tuscany, one of the richest princes of his time, went to meet Beatrix, his bride, mother of the well-known Matilda, about the year 1038, his whole train were so magnificently decorated, that his horses were not shod with iron, but with silver. The nails were even of the same metal; and when any of them dropped out, they belonged to those who found them. The marquis seems to have imitated Nero; but this anecdote may be only a fiction. It is related by a contemporary writer, but unfortunately, his account is in verse; and the author, perhaps, sensible of his inability to make his subject sufficiently interesting by poetical ornaments, availed himself of the licence claimed by poets to relate something singular and uncommon. However this may be, it is certain that the shoes of the horses must have been fastened on with nails, otherwise the author could not have mentioned them.\n\n\"Daniel the historian, seems to give us to understand, that in the ninth century, horses were not shod always, but only in the time of frost, and on other particular occasions. The practice of shoeing appears to have been introduced into England by William the Conqueror. We are informed that this sovereign gave the city of Northampton as a fief, to a certain person, in consideration of his paying a stated sum yearly for the shoeing of horses; and it is believed that Henry de Ferrers, or de Ferriers, who came over with William, and whose descendants still bear in their arms fix horse-shoes, received that surname, because he was entrusted with the inspection of the farriers. We may here observe, that horse-shoes have been found with other riding furniture, in the graves of some of the old Germans and Vandals in the northern countries; but the antiquity of them cannot be ascertained.\" Beckman on Inventions, vol. ii.\nOperations, suppose, to adapt it better, and make it fit closer to the hoof.\n\nThe consequences of this method of shoeing must be,\n1. That the function of the bars, whatever it may be, (and we have shewn that they are intended to prevent contraction of the feet,) must be destroyed.\n2. That cutting away the frog, exposes this part to injury, and is productive of many diseases.\n3. That the heels of the shoe being higher than the toe, will prevent the frogs from embracing the ground, for which we have shewn they were naturally intended.\n4. That by making the shoe concave at the quarters, and placing the nails near the heels, the growth of the crust in these parts is impeded, and thus the foot is contracted, and its proper shape destroyed.\n5. That by fattening the shoe near the inflexible frog at the heels, the proper action of the frogs and sole, as a spring to assist the motions of the animal, is destroyed.\n6. That by putting on the shoe hot, the moisture of the crusts is dried up, and thus the contraction of the foot is still farther increased; and,\n7. That by making the shoes rounded next the ground, the sure footing of the horse is greatly lessened, much to the danger of his rider.\n\nThe first modern writer who attempted to reform the common mode of shoeing, appears to have been Lafoffe. It is true that an excellent mode of shoeing was recommended about 300 years ago by Caesar Fiachchi, an Italian writer on horsemanship; but his plan never came into general use, and Lafoffe appears to have all the merit of the improvement, as it is more than probable that he had never seen Fiachchi's work. The shoe recommended by Lafoffe was what he called the half-moon shoe, being nearly semicircular, and reaching little further than to the middle of the foot; the nails being placed round the toe. Lafoffe's shoe was never very generally employed in this country, even though the improvement was rendered familiar by Bracken and Bartlet, who, as we have said, translated Lafoffe's treatise into English. It has been considered as useful in some cases of diseased feet, and for strong feet which have begun to contract, or appear likely to do so, provided such horses are not employed on very hard, rough roads; but it is by no means applicable to the majority of our horses. Its principal disadvantages appear to be, that the heels wear too fast, and that in running, horses are apt to slip with it.\n\nMr William Olmer, whose work on shoeing we have mentioned in No. 65, improved considerably on the shoe of Lafoffe. He forbade the frogs and bars to be cut away, except when they were ragged. He however, remarks, that the feet of all horses should be pared according to their length; the crust being made perfectly smooth by paring or rasping. His shoe was everywhere of an equal thickness, rather narrower behind than before, of a flat surface next the ground, and bevilled away from about the middle of its breadth inwards, leaving a flat surface for the crust to rest on.\n\nThe next improver of shoes was Lord Pembroke, though Mr Blaine most unaccountably places him after Mr Clark. Lord Pembroke's remarks on shoeing are exceedingly ingenious. He observed that the weight of shoes must, in a great measure, depend on the quality and hardness of the iron. If the iron be very good it will not bend, and in this case the shoes cannot possibly be too light; care, however, must be taken, that they be made of a thickness so as not to bend, for operations bending would tear out the nails, and ruin the hoof. That part of the shoe which is next the horse's heel, must be narrower than anywhere else, that stones may be thereby prevented from getting under it, and sticking there, which otherwise would be the case, because the iron when it advances inwardly beyond the bearing of the foot, makes a cavity, wherein stones being lodged, would remain, and by pressing against the foot, lame the horse. The part of the shoe which the horse walks upon, should be quite flat, and the inside of it likewise; and only just room enough should be left next the foot, to put in a picker, (which ought to be used every time the horse comes into the stable, and often on marches) and also to prevent the shoe's pressing upon the sole. Three, or at most four nails of a side, hold better than a greater number, and keep the hoof in a better state. He advises that the toe of the horse be cut square and short, and that no nails be placed in that part. By these means narrow heels are prevented, and many good effects produced. His lordship advised the hinder feet to be shod in the same manner as the fore-feet, except in hilly and slippery countries, where the shoes on the hinder feet may be a little turned up behind.\n\nThe utmost severity, (says Lord Pembroke), ought be inflicted on all those who clap shoes on hot. This unpardonable laziness of farriers in making feet fit shoes, instead of making shoes fitting feet, dries up the hoof, and utterly destroys them. Frequent removals of shoes are detrimental, and tear the foot, but sometimes they are very necessary. This is an inconvenience which half shoes are liable to (though excellent in several other respects), for the end of the shoe being very short, is apt to get soon into the foot, and consequently then must be moved.\n\nThe shoe recommended by Mr Clark did not differ very much from that of Olmer. He does not, however, recommend the hollowing of the surface of the shoe next the foot. Mr Clark recommended that the hoof and frog should not be pared or cut away without necessity, and was much against raising the heels with calkins; to the use of which he preferred that of an ice nail. He, however, admits, that sharp calkins may be necessary in hilly countries.\n\nThe shoe originally used at the veterinary college by Method of the first professor, was very similar to that of Olmer; the veterinary college when Mr Coleman succeeded to the professorship, adopted the half-moon shoe introduced by Lafoffe. This was, however, soon given up, as experience showed that it was not adapted to the generality of horses in this country. Within these few years, a method of shoeing has been introduced by Mr Coleman, which appears in most instances preferable to any former method. We shall therefore consider it pretty much at large.\n\nMr Coleman has laid down two general principles, by which the practice of shoeing for all horses, in every country, must be invariably followed. \"So long as nails and iron are employed to protect the hoof, the crust is the part that should receive the nails, and the prelude of the shoe; and the sole of every horse employed for every purpose, is a part that should not be in contact with the shoe.\" These are Mr Coleman's general rules, and to these it must be added, that the frog\nOperations. Frog should, in almost every case, be allowed to come into contact with the ground, where this is practicable, whenever the horse sets down its foot.\n\nTwo general circumstances are to be observed in shoeing; the cutting of the hoof, and the application of the shoe. Some parts of the hoof require to be removed, before the shoe can be applied; while others must be carefully preserved. These circumstances are at least of as much consequence as the form of the shoe, but are not in general so fully attended to.\n\nIn Mr Coleman\u2019s method of shoeing, he first recommends that a part of the horny sole between the whole length of the bars and crust, be pared away with a drawing knife, as the heels of the sole cannot receive the preasure of the shoe, without corns being produced. The sole must therefore be laid hollow, that it may not come in contact with the shoe. This he considers of the greatest consequence. The heels of the shoe must be made to rest on that part of the hoof where the bars unite with the crust. See fig. 19. If the heels have been previously lowered by means of the buttress, there may perhaps not be left sufficient sole to admit of the application of the drawing knife, without penetrating to the sensitive sole; so that it is better, first to cut the sole, as it may then be easily determined how far the heels may be lowered, and the toe shortened, with propriety. When the hoof is cut in this way, the sole readily descends when the hoof touches the ground, without being obstructed by the shoe; and stones, or other foreign bodies that have gotten between the shoe and the hoof, are thus readily pulled out. It is found by experience, that the sole never suffers from stones and gravel, when there is sufficient space left between the bars and the crust. The cavity between the sole and shoe should also be left sufficiently wide after the shoe is applied, to admit of the introduction of a large horse-picker, especially between the bars and the crust. If the sole should be naturally concave, a shoe that has a flat surface next the hoof will not touch any part of the sole when applied to the crust; and even should the sole be flat, or rounded in the middle or towards the toe, yet the quarters and heels may generally be made sufficiently hollow by the drawing knife, to avoid preasure on a flat shoe.\n\nIf it is found that a shoe with its upper surface flat, does not leave a space large enough to admit the picker between it and the sole, it is necessary to make either the sole or the shoe a little hollow. Sometimes the sole appears ragged and in flakes, and of considerable thickness. It is then proper to make the whole of the sole hollow with the drawing knife, before attempting to lower the heels or shorten the toe. When the sole is made hollow, the shoe will rest only on the crust; but if we cannot hollow the sole, we must, to prevent preasure, make the upper surface of the shoe hollow. As the hoof is always growing, and is preserved from friction by the shoe, it is necessary to pare the toe of the crust about once in every month. The more we can remove from the toe of the crust, in hoofs that are not well shaped, the sooner we shall be able to apply a shoe of the proper form and thickness.\n\n\"The bars and frog should never be removed. Where there are ragged and detached parts of the frog, it is better that they should be cut with any small knife, by the groom, than by the farrier; for if the latter is once allowed to touch the frog, the sound parts are generally destroyed. Where the frogs are not large and projecting, and the heels are higher than the frogs, then it is advisable to lower the heels, which may be done by a rasp, or the buttress; for in every case we are to endeavour to bring the frog in contact with the ground. We should never lose sight of this principle, that the frog must have preasure, or be diseased. If the frog does not touch the ground, it cannot perform its use; and no organ can be preserved in health, that does not perform the functions for which it was made. Nevertheless, where the frog has been disfigured for the functions for a considerable period, and become soft, it must be accustomed to preasure by degrees.\"\n\nWhen it is necessary for the horse to work, though his frog is soft and diseased, it must be gradually accustomed to preasure, by cutting down the hoof about one-tenth of an inch at every fresh shoeing, that the frog may become hard, and equally protuberant with the heels. If the horse be not required to labour, much advantage will be derived from allowing him to stand in the stable without shoes.\n\nThe feet of most horses have been deformed by bad shoe to be management. It will therefore be necessary to use a particular shoe to each particular form of hoof. Any one form employed indiscriminately for all feet, cannot be alike successful for all. It is from not having sufficiently attended to this simple fact, that the shoe recommended by the veterinary college has not been more generally adopted. It is therefore necessary to vary the length, breadth, and thickness of the shoe, according to the form of the hoof to which it is to be applied. If the heels or fore-feet are two inches and a half or more in depth; if the frog be found and prominent, and the roads dry, the toe of the hoof only requires to be shortened, and afterwards covered by a short shoe, which may be made of the usual thickness at the toe, but must be thinner gradually towards the heel. The proportional thickness of a shoe of this kind for a common saddle-horse, as recommended by Mr Coleman, is three-eighths of an inch at the toe, and one-eighth at the heel. By means of such a shoe the frog is completely brought in contact with the ground; the heels are expanded; and corns, thrushes, and canker are prevented. The horse may continue to wear such a shoe as long as the weather is warm, and the ground dry.\n\nRace-horses, who generally have the heels high, and the crust thicker and stronger than heavy horses, may generally wear short shoes, at least on the fore-feet. But such as have weak legs, bent knees, long pasterns, or low heels, must not wear such a shoe.\n\nA long shoe is necessary in wet weather, and even in summer, when the heels of the hoofs are low. In winter, when the heels are too high, they should be lowered gradually, by means of a rasp, rather than suffered to wear down, by being exposed to the ground with a short shoe; for moisture is very destructive to the hoof; and thus as great a part of it may be removed as is necessary. Besides, when a horse has been accustomed to high-heeled shoes, if he was suddenly made to wear those with thin heels, the frog might be bruised or inflamed, and the muscles and tendons of the leg considerably strained. It is therefore necessary to bring the heels of the shoe to the proper degree of thinness gradually,\nOperations dually, observing that the heels of each succeeding shoe be made somewhat thinner than those of the last. In general, as much as possible of the horny part of the hoof next the toe is to be removed, and as little iron employed next the heels every time of shoeing, till the feet be brought as nearly as may be to their natural shape.\n\nIn horses that have been accustomed to wear shoes of an equal thickness all round, and where the frog is healthy, we may in general apply a shoe, much thicker at the toe than the heel, by paring down the toe, and taking nothing from the heel; and if a horse appear to suffer no inconvenience from a thin-heeled shoe, during the first month after it is applied, it may be continued with safety, and will greatly improve the hoof. In young horses, however, that have never been shod, and in horses just taken up from grass, the toe seldom admits of being pared down, and a thin-heeled shoe cannot be applied at once.\n\nIn all cases where the frog does not embrace the ground with a thin shoe, the heels must be lowered; and if the horse has been accustomed to wear high-heeled shoes, both the shoe and the hoof must be gradually lowered, till the frog can safely and easily perform its proper function.\n\nA few horses require to be shod in a manner different from that which we have described, but still dependent on the same principles.\n\nDifferent weights of shoes are required for different horses. Mr Coleman lays down the following proportions, for horses of various descriptions.\n\nA moderate-sized coach-horse will require a weight of shoes and nails, from eighteen to twenty ounces; an inch wide, and half an inch thick at the toe, and three-fourths of an inch wide, and one-sixth of an inch thick at the heels.\n\nAn ordinary saddle-horse will require only from 12 to 14 ounces; and the shoe may be three-fourths of an inch wide at the toe, and half an inch at the heel, and three-eighths of an inch thick on the outside of the toe, but only one-eighth at the inside of the toe, and at the heel.\n\nThe shoe most recommended by Mr Coleman, is concave on its upper surface, where the sole is flat or convex, but it is flat on the rest of the upper surface; but if the sole admits of being hollowed, the whole upper surface may be flat. It is regularly concave on its lower surface next the ground; and it is fastened to the cruff by means of eight nails placed round from the toe backwards, so as to leave a part of the shoe about an inch and a half from the heel. Hunting-horses usually require an additional nail on each side, next the quarter. The nail-holes are made with a punch of a wedge-like form, and to correspond to this the heads of the nails are made conical, so that as long as any part of the head of the nail remains in the hole, the shoe cannot easily come off.\n\nFor hunters, and such horses as run in shafts, it is recommended by Mr Coleman to turn up the outer heel; but, as in this way there is often some inequality of position, the outer heel of the foot is to be lowered, while the inner heel of the shoe is somewhat thickened. By these means cutting is avoided.\n\nIn such horses as have weak low heels, Mr Coleman recommends the use of the bar-shoe, as the bar affords a support to the frogs, without wearing out the operations, heels. When the bar-shoe has been employed long enough to admit of the heels growing to the proper size, the ordinary thin-heeled shoe may be adopted.\n\nThe method recommended by Mr Coleman, as described above, has been for some time followed with considerable success by the board of ordnance, whose horses, as well as those of the British cavalry in general, are now shod after this manner. The method has, however, met with considerable opposition, partly from such as do not understand the principles on which it is founded, and partly from its having been too hastily adopted, in cases to which, as Mr Coleman himself allows, it is not generally applicable.\n\nFig. 19. and 20. illustrate Mr Coleman's method of shoeing.\n\nFig. 19. represents the hoof turned upwards, to show the manner in which the shoe is applied. It may be seen from this figure that the web of the shoe is hollow; that the heels at aa are narrower than the other parts of the shoe, and that the nails are placed all round from the toe backwards. Fig. 20. shows that the heels of the shoe are much thinner than the point, and also shows the manner in which the nails are riveted or clinched on the outside of the hoof round the toe and cruff.\n\nThe only remaining method of shoeing that we shall here mention, is that of the ingenious Mr Morecroft. This gentleman has acquired much celebrity by his invention of caulking shoes, by sinking them in dies, by which means horses may be fitted with any shoes best adapted to their hoofs. Mr Morecroft's shoe differs from Officer's, in being concave within for more than half its width. He condemns the use of calkins, on the principle that the public roads are now much more solid than when calkins were in general use; and, consequently, that instead of sinking them into the ground, they rather tend to raise the heels above it, and thus the frog is prevented from receiving the necessary pressure. Mr Morecroft, however, allows calkins to heavy draught-horses, for whom he recommends two on each shoe; but in lighter horses of the same description, one on the outside of each shoe. The latter is also recommended for hunters, but for other riding horses, he forbids the use of calkins. The number of nails in Mr Morecroft's shoe is usually eight, but in heavy draught-horses they are not to be placed on the sides of the shoe, but all round at equal distances, leaving a space at the heels of about two inches or two inches and a half. In frosty weather, Mr Morecroft recommends nails with a lozenge head, or a double counterlink, terminating in an edge instead of coming to a point, which greater breadth of surface prevents its being rubbed away so fast as a point. The thickness in the middle gives it strength, and the regular taper to the shank causes it to apply exactly to the side of the hole in the shoe, by which it is equally supported, and prevented from bending or breaking.\n\nMr Coleman considering pressure as necessary to the healthy action of the frog, has contrived a method of artificial affording this pressure in those cases in which, from difficult feet, or bad management in shoeing, it cannot naturally receive it; and where, if the heels were lowered, in order to bring the frog in contact with the ground, there would be danger of straining the tendons. Mr Coleman's patent artificial frogs are intended to produce\nPart III.\n\nFAR R I E R Y.\n\nOperations, due pressure on the natural frogs, while the horses are standing in the stable, and thus to give time for the growth of the heels, and to avoid the evils that would arise from lowering these too suddenly, or from allowing the frog to remain elevated above the ground. For the particulars of this ingenious invention, we must refer to Mr Coleman's pamphlet.\n\nWhere oxen are worked in farming buffaloes like horses, it is generally thought necessary to defend their hoofs in a similar manner by means of iron shoes. The form and manner of fitting these do not appear to be universally the same in all places; nor are we acquainted with the methods usually practised. We know that M. St Bel recommended the following methods; either to shoe the ox with a flat plate of iron, having five or seven nail-holes on the outer edge, accompanied with a projection of four or five inches of iron at the toe, which puffing the cleft of the foot, is bent over the hoof; or with eight shoes, one under each nail; otherwise with four, one under each internal nail; or only two, one under the external nail of each fore-foot.\n\nCHAP. II. Of Cafting.\n\nThere are several tedious and painful operations that we are sometimes obliged to perform, and which it would be difficult, or impossible to execute, were the animal left at full liberty to resist us. It is, therefore, necessary to render ourselves completely masters of him, by throwing him down on the ground, and in a convenient situation, so as not to expose him or ourselves to injury. This operation is called cafting, and is usually thus performed.\n\nThe first object is to prepare a thick bed of straw or litter, not less than eight feet square, to prevent the animal from being hurt in the fall. If the stable be sufficiently large to admit of the bed being made there, it is to be preferred, as, during the operation, to prepare for which cafting is necessary, the parts operated on will suffer less from exposure to the air in the stable, than without doors.\n\nBut, if there is not room in the stable, the bed must be made in the stable-yard, or rather, if possible, in some field or park adjoining.\n\nThe animal is now to be brought to one side of the bed; a strong leather strap, with a buckle at one end, and having an iron ring fixed to it, at a convenient distance from the buckle, is to be fixed round the pattern of each of the four legs, in such a way, that the rings of the straps that are round the fore-feet shall be directed backwards, and those of the straps on the hind-feet shall be opposite to these; while the buckles point outwards, to prevent hurting the animal. A pretty strong cord, ten or twelve feet long, is to be fastened to the ring of that strap that has been placed on the fore-foot on that side of the animal which is farthest from the bed; from this ring it is to pass through the ring on the hind-foot, on the same side, from which it passes through the ring on the other hind-foot, then through the ring on the other fore-foot, and lastly, through that to which it was first fastened. The animal being thus fettered, a number of men are to place themselves beside him, so that he may be between them and the bed, while others are to stand on the opposite side of the litter. Now, the men that are beside the animal, laying hold of the end of the rope, are to pull gradually with considerable force, so as to bring the four feet of the animal as near as possible together. When this is done, the men on the other side, standing in a row, one at the head of the animal, another at his chest, a third at his haunches, a fourth at his tail, &c., pull the animal toward them and complete his fall.\n\nIt is necessary to observe that the men who pull the rope, and those who receive the animal on the bed, must not act at the same time; as in this case the shock would be so great and sudden, as probably to occasion some accident, either to the men or to the animal. It is also proper to remark, that the animal must be cast in such a manner, that the part to be operated on may be fully in the view and reach of the operator.\n\nWhen the animal is once on the bed, his head must be held down by a man, and it will be proper to cover his eyes. Another assistant must stand by the cord, which for greater security, should be fastened with a knot at the first ring.\n\nThere are some little niceties to be observed in casting an animal, according to the operation that is intended to be performed on him; but of these we shall speak, when we describe the operations themselves.\n\nCHAP. III. Of Bleeding.\n\nBleeding is distinguished into general and local. General bleeding is performed for the purpose of taking away a quantity of blood from the general maws, and consists in opening some large vein, or some considerable branch of an artery. The vein usually opened, in horses and cattle, is the vein that runs along the neck, and which is called the jugular vein. This vein may be easily felt, as it is generally considerably raised above the muscles.","sp":48,"ep":55},{"h":"THE VEIN IS USUALLY OPENED BY","t":"e vein is usually opened by means of a fleam, which is forced into the vein, by striking it with a small wooden mallet, called by farriers a blood-flick. There are many objections to this mode of bleeding. In the first place, it is extremely clumsy; and, if the vein happens to roll, which is very commonly the case, a large wound may be made in the skin, without drawing blood. Again, these animals, especially horses, are easily frightened by any sudden motion of the hand; and some persons have the way of shaking the blood-flick before they give the stroke; and, in doing this, they often use more exertion than is necessary. The animal alarmed at these strange motions, tosses up his head, and thus renders the stroke uncertain.\n\nMany prefer the ordinary lancet used by surgeons; and, in several cases, particularly of local bleeding, this is the most convenient instrument. But in opening the jugular vein, we do not consider it as much superior to the common fleam. When this latter is employed, the back of it should be made of considerable thickness, as, when it is too narrow, as is commonly the case, when the instrument is struck with the flick, it sinks into the channel of the vein, which is often not opened, as the prominent muscles of the neck receive the stroke.\n\nFor most purposes of bleeding, we would recommend the spring-fleam, as being easily applied, and much more certain in its effect.\n\nIt is a common practice with grooms and farriers, to tie a rope or other ligature about the neck of the animal, neck.\nOperations animal, previous to the bleeding in the jugular vein. They do this from a supposition that the vein will thus swell the more readily, and that it will be opened with greater certainty. But this ligature is in most cases unnecessary, and will at some times be highly dangerous.\n\nWhere exercise is not improper before bleeding, it will be sufficient that the animal be gently trotted previous to the operation, as thus the circulation will be promoted, and the superficial veins will be sufficiently filled with blood. Where general exercise is improper or inadmissible, the filling of the vein may easily be promoted by briskly rubbing the neck for some time with a wisp of straw or hay; and just before applying the fleam, it will be proper to press with one finger upon that part of the vein that is between the shoulder and the place where the fleam is applied.\n\nThe danger of a ligature will appear both from reason and experience. When the ligature is fastened round the neck, it produces a swelling of the vein on each side; and thus the circulation being in a great measure impeded, and the return of much of the blood from the head prevented, an accumulation of blood takes place in the vessels of the brain. If the ligature be continued round the neck, which must happen when, by want of dexterity of the operator, or by the horse being frightened, the vein has not been opened at the first attempt, the stagnation of the blood in the head goes on to an alarming degree, and the horse not unfrequently falls down in an apoplectic fit. \"In such cases,\" says Mr Clark, \"I have observed the operator greatly disconcerted, and desirous of any further attempts to draw blood at that time, being prepossessed with the idea that the horse was vicious and unruly, although the very treatment the horse had just undergone rendered bleeding at this time the more necessary, in order to make a speedy revulsion from the vessels of the head; therefore a ligature or bandage ought never to be used till such time as the opening is made into the vein, and even then it will not be necessary at all times, if the horse can stand on his feet, as a moderate pressure with the finger on the vein will make the blood flow freely; but if the horse is lying on the ground, a ligature will be necessary.\"\n\nBut further, the concussion or shock the horse receives from his falling down, in the above situation, which will always happen if the ligature is too long continued, may cause a blood-vessel in the head to burst, and death may be the consequence.\n\nThe place where the vein is to be opened is of some consequence, as, when the opening is made too far from the head, where the vein lies deep among the muscles, both the vein is not so easily opened, and the wound is not so readily healed. The most proper place for opening the jugular vein is about an inch below the joining of the small branches that come from the lower jaw. This is generally about a hand-breadth from the head, but it may be easily seen by the swelling of the vein when pressure is made on its trunk.\n\nBefore opening the vein, it is usual to wet the hairs that lie above it, and to stroke them in the direction of the intended orifice. This is a good practice, as the instrument thus passes through the skin more readily, not having to overcome the resistance of the hair. In mentioning the direction of the orifice, it is worth while to remark, that this should neither be longitudinal nor directly across the vein, but rather oblique; as the flow of blood from an oblique orifice is most easily stopped.\n\nWhen the vein is opened, it is highly proper in all cases to catch the blood in some convenient vessel. It is a very absurd practice, although it is commonly adopted, to allow the blood to flow at random on the ground or on a dunghill, by which means no precise estimate can be made of the quantity of blood taken away. This may either be so small, as to be of no advantage; or it may be so considerable as to produce fainting, before the operator thinks of stopping the orifice.\n\nFor the purpose of measuring the quantity of blood taken away, Mr White recommends a graduated vessel, capable of containing five quarts; every pint being marked on the inside of the vessel, so that the quantity of blood that is taken off may be exactly known. The blood should always be preserved, that we may judge from its appearance of the nature of the disease, and whether it is proper, or not, to repeat the operation. If the blood continues fluid for a considerable time, it shows that there is an inflammatory state of the body; and if a jelly-like substance, of a whitish or light buff colour, and rather firm consistence, appears on the surface after the blood has cooled, and especially if the surface is hollowed, we may be certain that the animal's complaint is of an inflammatory nature, that the bleeding has been proper, and must be repeated, if the symptoms continue or increase; but if the blood coagulates quickly, is uniformly of a dark liver colour, loose, and easily broken, with a considerable quantity of water upon its surface, it denotes debility, and shows that the disease arises from a weakness of the system; that instead of bleeding, tonic and cordial medicines are to be employed, with everything that may tend to restore the animal's strength.\n\nWhen a sufficient quantity of blood has been taken away, it is for the most part necessary to secure the orifice, in order to prevent future accidental bleeding. This is usually done by thrusting a common pin through the lips of the wound, and twining about it a little horse hair. As in this way the wound often rankles, and becomes a sore difficult to heal, which we are disposed to attribute to the brass pin employed, as often as to any other cause; we would recommend a pin of silver, or at least polished steel. The pin need not pass through more than the skin, and in some cases when the horse can conveniently be fastened to the rack after bleeding, the pin may be entirely dispensed with.\n\nAs it is often required to bleed on either side of the neck, or on both sides, it is proper that the operator should be able to bleed with either hand. This is indeed not quite so necessary in bleeding horses and cattle, as in the human subject; but it will be often found very convenient in both.\n\nIn some cases, especially in inflammation of the brain, where a sudden and copious loss of blood is required, it becomes necessary to open the temporal artery. This is easily effected, as the artery is situated very superficially, about an inch and a half backwards from the upper and outer corner of the eye. It is most conveniently opened with a lancet, and when a sufficient quantity of blood has been drawn, the flow is in general very easily stopped by making continued pressure upon the artery; or, if this should not succeed, and a dangerous effusion\nTopical bleeding is useful in several cases, as in inflammatory affections of the feet, which are often relieved by opening the coronary veins, or the vein that encircles the coffin-bone; in inflammation of the eyes, in which blood may be often drawn, from the angular veins, with considerable succus; and in affections of the mouth, where it is sometimes useful to draw blood, by clarifying the bars of the mouth, or even, in some urgent cases, by opening the veins of the palate. Topical bleeding is best performed with a lancet.\n\nAlmost the only method that is practised for bleeding sheep, or dogs, is to cut off a joint or two of the tail; and this is certainly often productive of good consequences, as the flow of blood is sometimes pretty considerable. Unfortunately, however, we can seldom have recourse to this mode of bleeding more than once or twice, whereas cases often occur in which it is necessary to repeat the bleeding. It is also a cruel method, and we see no reason why the veins in these animals may not be opened like those of horses and cattle. In the sheep, indeed, the thickness of the wool will commonly prevent bleeding in the neck, but the temporal artery and the veins of the foot may be opened without difficulty; and in most dogs we may bleed in the jugular-vein with nearly as much ease, as in the horse or cow.\n\n**CHAP. IV. Of making Rowels and Setons.**\n\nRowels in horses and cattle are much the same as rowelling in the human body. The operation consists in incising the skin, so as to insert between it and the cellular membrane some foreign body, which is kept there, in order to produce and keep up a suppuration, or running of purulent matter. The operation is usually performed in the following manner. An incision is made through the skin by means of a very sharp pair of scissors, or what appears better, a sharp knife. The finger is then introduced below the skin, so as to separate it from the flesh all round, as far as the finger will reach. A piece of leather, about the size of a crown-piece, and of a circular form, with a hole cut in the middle, is then inserted between the skin and muscles, having been first anointed with some stimulating ointment. A small piece of tow or caddice spread with the same ointment, is put over the hole in the centre of the leather; the skin is laid down over all, and the part is covered with a pledget, also covered with ointment, to keep out the external air.\n\nThe leather is left in this situation for two or three days, during which the parts adjoining the rowel swell, and at the end of the time there appears a discharge of a yellowish matter, which gradually becomes thicker and whiter. In three days at farthest the part must be examined, and the plug removed from the central hole, to allow the matter to flow out. The rowel is now complete, and may be continued as long as shall be found necessary. The action of the rowel is easily explained; the leather introduced excites a degree of inflammation between the skin and the flesh, and no means being taken to check this, it goes on, like most other inflammations of fleshy parts, to suppuration. Thus a discharge is produced from the part, which is found to have considerable effect in checking inflammation of some more important organ near which the rowel...\nOperations. Rowel has been inserted. Thus, in inflammation of the lungs, after copious bleeding, a rowel in the chest, like a blister in the human body, is found to have considerable effect in checking the progress of the disease.\n\nRowels may be placed in most of the fleshy parts of the body; but they are most commonly inserted in the belly, the breast, the inside of the thighs, the outside of the shoulders, and the hips. They are sometimes placed between the jaw-bones, below the tongue; but this is very improper, as a good suppuration can seldom be brought on in this place.\n\nIt is sometimes found necessary to make several rowels at the same time; but they should always be placed, as nearly as possible, to the seat of the affection which they are intended to relieve.\n\nBesides dangerous inflammations, rowels are found serviceable in large swellings of the hind legs, in obstinate cases of gout, and in strains of the shoulder.\n\nThough rowels are thus found extremely useful in many cases, they are, like many other operations performed on brute animals, sometimes made where they are unnecessary or improper. Where there is considerable debility, the insertion of a rowel would be very injurious, as it would not suppurate kindly, and as the discharge produced would tend still farther to increase the debility. The discharge in these cases is usually thin and ichorous; sometimes they are perfectly dry, and not unfrequently a mortification is produced. When a rowel is found to be attended with any of these effects, it must be immediately removed, and the parts must be fomented with a warm decoction of the chamomile-flowers, and some stimulating herbs; or must be bathed with spirit of wine or oil of turpentine. If gangrene should have come on, it will besides be necessary to administer cordial and strengthening remedies.\n\nSetons are inserted through an opening made in two opposite parts of the skin, and the extraneous body introduced is a cord.","sp":55,"ep":58},{"h":"THIS EQUATION EVIDENTLY","t":"s equation evidently expresses the nature of a curve such, that \\( \\frac{(x^2 + y^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{x} \\), its radius of curvature (\\$ 97.), is equal to \\( X \\) a function of \\( x \\) one of its coordinates.\n\n198.

According to this hypothesis we shall have\n\n\\[\ny = Ax^n, \\quad y = (a-1)Ax^{n-2} \\dot{x},\n\\]\n\nand thus the proposed equation becomes\n\n\\[\n(a-1)Ax^{n-2} + aAx^{n+2} = 0.\n\\]\n\nIt will not be possible to give to \\( a \\) such a value that the two exponents \\( a-2 \\) and \\( a+n \\) shall become equal, except in the particular case of \\( n = -2 \\); but if we suppose \\( x \\) very small the equation may be satisfied in two ways, namely, by taking \\( a = 0 \\), and \\( a = 1 \\), because upon either supposition the term \\( a(a-1)Ax^{n-2} \\), which is the greatest, vanishes, and therefore \\( A \\) is left indeterminate; thus we have two series, one beginning with \\( A \\), and the other with \\( Ax \\).\n\nAssuming therefore successively\n\n\\[\ny = A + Bx^3 + Cx^2 + \\ldots + \\infty,\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = Ax + Bx^4 + Cx^5 + \\ldots + \\infty,\n\\]\n\nand substituting these values as well as their corresponding values of \\( \\dot{y} \\) in the proposed equation, we shall find by arranging the terms, that \\( a \\) ought to be \\( = 2 \\); afterwards by determining the coefficients \\( A, B, C, \\ldots \\) in the usual manner (ALGEBRA, \u00a7 261.), we obtain two series, one of these is\n\n\\[\nA - \\frac{aAx^{n+2}}{(n+1)(n+2)} + \\frac{a^2Ax^{n+4}}{(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)(n+4)} - \\frac{a^3Ax^{n+6}}{(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)(n+4)(n+5)(n+6)} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nVol. VIII.

The fluxional equation \\( y + ax^n y \\dot{x} = 0 \\) is however of such a nature that from two particular values of \\( y \\) we may deduce its general value; for let us denote these values by \\( z \\) and \\( Z \\), then, as each of them must satisfy the fluxional equation, we have\n\n\\[\n\\dot{x} + ax^n \\dot{x} = 0, \\quad \\dot{Z} + ax^n \\dot{Z} = 0;\n\\]\n\nlet \\( c \\) and \\( C \\) denote two arbitrary constant quantities, then we have also\n\n\\[\nc + cax^n \\dot{x} = 0, \\quad CZ + Cax^n \\dot{Z} = 0,\n\\]\n\nand as each of these equations is identical, their sum must also be identical, that is\n\n\\[\nc + CZ + ax^n(c + CZ) \\dot{x} = 0;\n\\]\n\nbut the very same result will be obtained if we substitute \\( c + CZ \\) instead of \\( y \\) in the proposed fluxional equation, therefore \\( c + CZ \\) is also a value of \\( y \\), and as it involves two arbitrary constant quantities \\( c \\) and \\( C \\), it possesses all the generality of which the value of \\( y \\) is susceptible. Hence it follows that that if \\( c \\) be put instead of \\( A \\) in one of the two series which we have found for the value of \\( y \\), and \\( C \\) instead of \\( A \\) in the other series, the sum of the two results will be a general expression for the value of \\( y \\).\n\n200. Having now explained the theory of fluxional equations at as great length as we conceive to be compatible with the nature of this work we shall conclude this treatise by resolving a few problems which produce fluxional equations.\n\nProb. I. Having given any hyperbolic, or as it may more properly be called Napierian logarithm, it is required to find a general expression for its corresponding natural number.\n\nLet the number be denoted by \\( 1+x \\), and its logarithm by \\( y \\), then \\( y = \\frac{x}{1+x} \\) (\\$ 57.), or\n\n\\[\n\\dot{y} + xy - \\dot{x} = 0,\n\\]\n\nand the problem requires that from this equation we deduce an expression for \\( x \\).\n\nAs when \\( y = 0 \\), then \\( x = 0 \\), we may assume\n\n\\[\nx = Ay + By^2 + Cy^3 + \\ldots + \\infty,\n\\]\n\nthen \\( \\dot{x} = Ay + 2By^2 + 3Cy^3 + \\ldots + \\infty \\),\n\nand our equation becomes\n\n\\[\n\\dot{y} + Ay \\dot{y}.\n\\]\n\\[ y + Ay \\dot{y} + By^2 \\dot{y} + Cy^3 \\dot{y} + \\ldots = 0. \\]\n\nHence, by comparing the coefficients of the like terms, it appears that \\( A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, D = 4, \\ldots \\), so that \\( A = 1, B = \\frac{1}{2}, C = \\frac{1}{2.3}, D = \\frac{1}{2.3.4}, \\ldots \\).\n\nTherefore \\( x = y + \\frac{y^2}{2} + \\frac{y^3}{2.3} + \\frac{y^4}{2.3.4} + \\ldots \\).\n\n---\n\n**Prob. 2.** Let \\( AB, AC \\) be two straight lines given by position meeting each other at right angles in \\( A \\), let \\( C \\) be a given point in \\( AC \\) one of the lines, and let a straight line \\( PQ \\) meet them in \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\), and cut off from them equal segments \\( AP, CQ \\) adjacent to the given points \\( A, C \\), it is required to find the nature of the curve to which \\( PQ \\) is a tangent.\n\nLet \\( D \\) be the point in which the tangent \\( PQ \\) meets the curve, draw \\( DE \\) perpendicular to \\( AC \\), and \\( DF \\) to \\( AP \\), put \\( CA = a, CE = x, ED = y \\), then \\( AE \\) or \\( DF = a - x \\), and since \\( EQ = \\frac{yx}{y} \\) (\\$73.) and \\( EQ : ED :: DF : FP \\), therefore \\( FP = \\frac{(a-x)y}{x} \\); hence \\( PA = (PF + FA) \\frac{(a-x)y}{x} + y \\), and \\( CQ = (CE - EQ = x - \\frac{yx}{y}) \\), and as by hypothesis \\( AP = CQ \\), therefore\n\n\\[ y + \\frac{(a-x)y}{x} = x - \\frac{yx}{y}. \\]\n\nThis expression belongs to a class of fluxional equations which have the singular property of being more easily resolved by first taking their fluxion, considering the fluxion of one of the variable quantities as constant; thus, in the present case, making \\( x \\) constant, we find\n\n\\[ \\dot{y} \\dot{x} \\dot{y} - (a-x) \\dot{y} \\dot{x} = \\dot{x} \\dot{x} \\dot{y}^2 - y \\dot{x} \\dot{y}. \\]\n\nor \\( \\frac{(a-x)y}{x} = \\frac{y \\dot{x} \\dot{y}}{\\dot{y}^2} \\),\n\nhence dividing by \\( \\dot{y} \\), the equation is easily reduced to\n\n\\[ \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{y}} = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(a-x)}}. \\]\n\nand taking the fluents\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{y} = c - \\sqrt{(a-x)} \\]\n\nbut when \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( y = 0 \\), therefore \\( c = \\sqrt{a} \\), and\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{y} = \\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{(a-x)}, \\text{ or } x = 2 \\sqrt{ay} - y, \\]\n\nwhich equation belongs to the common parabola.\n\n---\n\n**Prob. 3.** Let \\( APQ \\) be one of any number of curves of the parabolic kind, having the same vertex \\( A \\), and axis \\( AE \\), and the nature of which is defined by the equation \\( p x^n = y^n \\), where \\( x \\) denotes the abscissa \\( AB \\), and \\( y \\) the ordinate \\( PB \\), and \\( p \\) an indeterminate quantity which is the same for the whole of any one of the parabolas, but different for different parabolas; it is required to find the nature of a curve that shall intersect them all in a given angle.\n\nLet the curve whose nature is required meet any one of the parabolas in \\( P \\), let \\( PT, P \\) tangents to the two curves meet the axis in \\( T \\) and \\( t \\), then, from the nature of the problem, the lines \\( PT, P \\) must contain a given angle, let \\( a \\) denote its numerical tangent.\n\nBecause \\( PT \\) touches the parabola, the tangent of the angle \\( PTB \\) will be equal to \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\) (\\$75.) the value of this expression being supposed deduced from the equation \\( p x^n = y^n \\); but taking the fluxion of this equation, and eliminating the indeterminate quantity \\( p \\) by means of the two equations, we find \\( \\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{my}{nx} \\), therefore tan.\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{my}{nx}. \\]\n\nAgain, by considering \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) as the abscissa and ordinate of the curve whose equation is sought, and to which \\( P \\) is a tangent, we have the tangent of the angle \\( t \\) equal to \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\) (\\$75.).

We shall employ the same construction and notation here as in \u00a7 154, with the addition of drawing the chords \\( DD' \\), \\( PQ \\), \\( PP' \\), and putting the arch \\( AP = z \\); then it is manifest that the simultaneous increments of \\( v \\), \\( z \\), and \\( r \\) will be the arches \\( DD' \\), \\( PP' \\), and the straight line \\( PQ \\) respectively. Hence\n\n\\[ \\frac{z}{v} = \\text{limit of } \\frac{\\text{arch } PP'}{\\text{arch } DD'} \\]\n\nbut it is evident from \u00a7 62, that the limiting ratio of those arches must be the same as that of their chords, therefore,\n\n\\[ \\frac{z}{v} = \\text{limit of } \\frac{\\text{chord } PP'}{\\text{chord } DD'} \\]\n\nnow the limit of the angle \\( PQD \\) being evidently a right angle, we have\n\n\\[ \\lim_{PP'/DD'} = \\lim_{\\sqrt{(PQ^2 + QD^2)}}{DD'} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\lim_{\\sqrt{\\frac{PQ^2}{DD'^2} + \\frac{QD^2}{DD'^2}}} \\]\n\nbut \\( \\frac{PQ^2}{DD'^2} = \\frac{FP^2}{FD^2} = r^2 \\), and \\( \\lim_{\\frac{QD^2}{DD'^2}} = \\frac{r^2}{v^2} \\), therefore\n\n\\[ \\frac{z}{v} = \\sqrt{\\left(r^2 + \\frac{r^2}{v^2}\\right)} \\]\n\nand \\( z = \\sqrt{\\left(r^2 \\dot{v}^2 + \\frac{r^2}{v^2}\\right)} \\).\n\nLet us apply this formula to the spiral of Archimedes, Fig. 27, the equation of which (\\$ 155.) is \\( amv = nr \\), and therefore\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{nr}{am}, \\quad \\text{and } \\dot{v} = \\frac{n^2 r^2}{a^2 m^2}; \\quad \\text{hence} \\]\n\n\\[ z = \\int \\sqrt{\\left(\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{r^2 \\dot{v}^2}{v^2}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{a} \\int \\dot{r} \\sqrt{\\left(\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{n^2 r^2}{m^2}\\right)} \\]\n\nThis fluent may be found by formula B, \u00a7 151, and it is worthy of remark that the fluxion has the same form as that which we have found in \u00a7 161 for an arch of a parabola; thus the length of any portion of the spiral of Archimedes may be exhibited by means of an arch of a parabola.\n\nTo find the Content of Solids.\n\n163. If \\( AD \\) the abscissa of a curve be denoted by \\( x \\), Fig. 4, and \\( PD \\) the ordinate by \\( y \\), and the solid generated by the revolution of the curve \\( APD \\) about \\( AD \\) as an axis by \\( s \\), it has been shown, in \u00a7 64, that \\( s = \\pi y^2 x \\), therefore the general formula for finding the content of a solid is\n\n\\[ s = \\pi \\int y^2 x \\]\n\nEx. 1. Suppose the solid to be a paraboloid, or that which is generated by the revolution of a parabola about its axis; in this case \\( y = ax \\), and taking the fluent so that when \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( s = 0 \\),\n\n\\[ s = \\pi \\int y^2 x = \\pi a \\int x \\dot{x} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi ax^2. \\]\n\nor \\( s = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi ax^2 \\); but \\( \\pi ax^2 \\) is the content of a cylinder having \\( y \\) for the radius of its base and \\( x \\) for its altitude, therefore the content of a paraboloid is half that of a cylinder having the same base and altitude.\n\nEx. 2. Suppose the solid to be a parabolic spindle, Fig. 31, which is generated by the revolution of \\( APB \\) an arch of a parabola about \\( AC \\) an ordinate to its axis. In this case let \\( AD = x \\), \\( DP = y \\), \\( AB = b \\), the parameter of the\nInverse axis \\(=a\\), then from the nature of the parabola \\(AD \\times DB = a \\times PD\\), that is \\(x(b-x)=ay\\), hence \\(y=\\frac{(b-x)x}{a}\\), and taking the fluent, so that \\(s\\) and \\(x\\) may vanish together;\n\n\\[ s = \\pi \\int y^2 \\dot{x} = \\frac{\\pi}{a^3} \\int x^3 (b-x)^2 \\dot{x} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{\\pi}{a^3} \\int \\left( b^3 x^2 - 2 bx^3 + x^4 \\right) \\dot{x} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{\\pi}{a^3} \\left( \\frac{b^3 x^3}{3} - \\frac{bx^4}{2} + \\frac{x^5}{5} \\right) \\]\n\nor, since \\(a^2 = \\frac{(b-x)^2 x^2}{y^2}\\),\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{\\pi y^2}{(b-x)^2} \\left\\{ \\frac{b^2 x}{3} - \\frac{bx^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{5} \\right\\}, \\]\n\nwhich expression (by supposing \\(x=AC=\\frac{1}{2}b\\), and putting \\(d\\) for CE, the greatest value of \\(y\\)) gives \\(\\frac{4\\pi d^2 b}{15}\\) or the content of half the solid generated by the curve AEB, therefore the entire spindle is \\(\\frac{8\\pi a^2 b}{15}\\), or (by observing that \\(\\pi d^2 h\\) is the content of a cylinder having \\(d\\) for the radius of its base and \\(b\\) for its length) it is \\(\\frac{8\\pi}{15}\\) of the circumscribing cylinder.\n\nEx. 3. Suppose the solid to be a spheroid produced by the revolution of an ellipse about either of its axes; put \\(a\\) for \\(\\frac{1}{2}AB\\) the axis round which the curve revolves, \\(b\\) for \\(\\frac{1}{2}EF\\) the other axis, \\(x\\) for AD the height of any segment made by a plane perpendicular to the axis of the solid, \\(y\\) for PD the radius of its base, and \\(s\\) for its content. Then, from the nature of the curve \\(y^2 = \\frac{b^2}{a^2} (2ax-x^2)\\), therefore, taking the fluent upon the supposition that \\(s\\) and \\(x\\) vanish together,\n\n\\[ s = \\pi \\int y^2 \\dot{x} = \\frac{\\pi b^3}{a^3} \\int (2ax-x^2) \\dot{x} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{\\pi b^3}{a^3} \\left( ax^2 - \\frac{x^3}{3} \\right). \\]\n\nTo find the content of the whole spheroid we have only to take \\(x=2a\\), thus the formula becomes \\(s=\\frac{4\\pi b^2 a}{3}\\), and as \\(2\\pi b^2 a\\) expresses the content of a cylinder having \\(2b\\) for the diameter of its base, and \\(2a\\) for its height, it follows that the content of a spheroid is \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) that of its circumscribing cylinder.\n\nIt is obvious that what has been found for the spheroid will apply also to the sphere, by supposing the axes equal, or \\(a=b\\).\n\n164. If instead of supposing the solid \\(APQ\\) to be formed by the revolution of a curve round its axis (in which case it is called a solid of revolution) we had supposed it to have any figure whatever, then by referring the solid to some straight line AC, given by position, as an axis, and in which A is a given point, and supposing PQ to be a section of the solid made by a plane perpendicular to that axis, meeting it in D, and putting \\(AD=x\\), and the variable solid \\(APQ\\) (considered as a function of \\(x\\)) \\(=s\\), by proceeding as in \u00a7 64, we would have found the limit of \\(\\frac{\\text{increment of } s}{\\text{increment of } x}\\), and consequently \\(\\frac{s}{x}\\), equal to the area of the section of the solid made by the plane \\(PQ\\); therefore, putting \\(V\\) for that function of \\(x\\) which expresses the area of the section, we have \\(s=Vx\\), and \\(s=\\int Vx\\).\n\nLet us suppose for example that \\(AEFG\\) is a solid Fig. 34 bounded by any plane figure \\(EFG\\) as a base, and by the surface which will be generated if we suppose a straight line drawn from A any given point above that plane to revolve in the circumference of the base.\n\nLet AC be a perpendicular drawn from the vertex of the figure to its base, and let PQ be a section of the solid by a plane parallel to the base, meeting the perpendicular in D. Put \\(a=\\) the area of the base of the solid, \\(V=\\) the area of the section \\(PQ\\), \\(b=\\) AC the altitude of the whole solid, \\(x=\\) AD the altitude of the part cut off by the plane \\(PQ\\), and \\(s=\\) the content of that part; then, as from the nature of the solid it is pretty evident that the part of it cut off by the plane \\(PQ\\) is similar to the whole, and as the bases of similar solids are as the squares of their altitudes, we have\n\n\\[ a : V :: b^2 : x^2, \\] hence \\(V=\\frac{ax^2}{b^2}\\), and\n\n\\[ s=\\int Vx=\\frac{a}{b^2} \\int x^2 \\dot{x} = \\frac{a x^3}{3 b^2}, \\]\n\nthis expression for \\(s\\) does not require the addition of any constant quantity, for by putting \\(x=0\\), we have \\(s=0\\) as it ought to be. Suppose now \\(x=b\\), then \\(s=\\frac{ab^3}{3b^2}=\\frac{1}{3}ab\\), from which it appears that the content of the whole solid is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the product of the base by the perpendicular. It is evident that pyramids and cones are solids of the kind we have been considering.\n\nTo find the Surfaces of Solids.\n\n165. The altitude AD of a solid, generated by revolution of a curve about AD as an axis, being as before denoted by \\(x\\), and PD the radius of its base by \\(y\\), let us now put \\(s\\) to denote the curved surface of the solid, then, as it has been shewn, \u00a7 65, that \\(s=2\\pi y\\sqrt{(x^2+y^2)}\\), we have\n\n\\[ s=2\\pi \\int y \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2)} \\]\n\nas a general formula for the surface of a solid.\n\nEx. 1. Suppose the solid to be a sphere, generated by the revolution of a circle about its diameter AB, put Fig. 35 the radius of the sphere \\(=a\\), then, AD being denoted by \\(x\\), and PD by \\(y\\), we have from the nature of the curve \\(y^2=2ax-x^2\\), therefore\n\n\\[ y=\\sqrt{(2ax-x^2)}, \\text{ and } \\dot{y}=\\frac{(a-x)\\dot{x}}{\\sqrt{(2ax-x^2)}}. \\]\nPart II.\n\n\\[ \\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 = \\dot{x}^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{(a-x)^2}{2a x - x^2}\\right) \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{a^2 \\dot{x}^2}{2a x - x^2} = \\frac{a^2 \\dot{x}^2}{y^2}, \\]\n\ntherefore, \\( y \\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2} = a \\dot{x} \\), and taking the fluent, so that when \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( s = 0 \\),\n\n\\[ s = 2 \\pi \\int y \\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2} = 2 \\pi a x; \\]\n\nnow if it be considered that \\( 2 \\pi a \\) is the circumference of a great circle of the sphere, it will immediately appear that the surface of a segment of a sphere is equal to the circumference of a great circle of the sphere multiplied into the height of the segment. Hence it follows that the whole surface of the sphere is equal to four times the area of one of its great circles.\n\nEx. 2. Suppose the curve to be a parabola, then putting \\( AD = x \\), \\( DP = y \\), the parameter of the axis \\( a \\), we have (\\$ 161, example 1.)\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2} = \\frac{1}{a} \\dot{y} \\sqrt{a^2 + 4y^2}, \\text{ therefore} \\]\n\n\\[ s = 2 \\pi \\int y \\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{2 \\pi}{a} \\int y \\dot{y} \\sqrt{a^2 + 4y^2} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{\\pi}{6a} (a^2 + 4y^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} + C, \\text{ by } \\$ 108. \\]\n\nTo discover the value of the constant quantity \\( C \\), we must observe that when \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( y = 0 \\), and \\( s = 0 \\), therefore, putting 0 instead of \\( s \\) and \\( y \\), the above equation becomes \\( 0 = \\frac{\\pi}{6a} + C \\), hence \\( C = -\\frac{\\pi}{6a} \\), and\n\n\\[ s = \\pi \\left\\{ \\frac{(a^2 + 4y^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{6a} \\right\\}. \\]\n\nTo find the Centre of Gravity of any Line, Surface, or Solid.\n\n166. It belongs to the theory of Mechanics to explain what is meant by the centre of gravity, and to demonstrate its general properties, and here it is only necessary to show how the method of fluxions may be applied to deduce from some one of those properties rules for finding that centre in any proposed case.\n\nThe property of centres of gravity which we shall employ as the foundation of the application of the method of fluxions to its determination may be enunciated shortly thus.\n\nLet \\( C \\) be the centre of gravity of a mass of matter denoted by \\( M \\), and \\( c \\) the centre of gravity of another mass \\( m \\), and \\( D \\) the centre of gravity of the two masses \\( M \\) and \\( m \\), from these points let perpendiculars \\( CA, c a, DE \\) be drawn to any straight line \\( PQ \\), then\n\n\\[ M \\times CA + m \\times c a = (M + m) \\times DE. \\]\n\n167. Let us now suppose that \\( AP \\) is any curve line having weight, of which the centre of gravity is required, and that \\( PB, PD \\) are co-ordinates drawn from any point in the curve perpendicular to \\( AB, AD \\) two axes at right angles to each other; let the arch \\( AP \\) receive any increment \\( Pp \\), let \\( C \\) be the centre of gravity of \\( AP \\), \\( G \\) the centre of gravity of \\( Pp \\), and \\( C' \\) the centre of gravity of \\( APp \\). From \\( C \\) and \\( G \\) draw \\( CE, CF, GH, GK \\) perpendicular to the axes \\( AB, AD \\). Put \\( PD = x, PB = y, CF = X, CE = Y, AP = z \\), also let the arch \\( APp = z' \\), and let the distances of \\( C' \\) its centre of gravity from the axes \\( AD, AB \\) be denoted by \\( X', Y' \\) respectively; then, observing that the arch \\( Pp = z' - z \\), by the proposition in last \u00a7,\n\n\\[ X + (z' - z) \\times GK = z' X' \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{z' X'}{z' - z} = z X = GK; \\]\n\nIf we now suppose the arch \\( Pp \\) to be continually diminished, and observe that \\( z' X' - z X \\), and \\( z' - z \\) are the simultaneous increments of \\( z X \\) and \\( z \\), it will appear (\\$ 23.) that\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{flux. of } (z X)}{z} = \\text{limit of } GK. \\]\n\nBy the very same way of reasoning we find\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{flux. of } (z Y)}{z} = \\text{limit of } GH, \\]\n\nbut the point \\( p \\) approaching to \\( P \\), it is manifest that the point \\( G \\) will also approach to \\( P \\), so that the limit of \\( GK \\) is \\( PD \\) or \\( x \\), and the limit of \\( GH \\) is \\( PB \\) or \\( y \\), hence\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{flux. } (z X)}{z} = x, \\quad \\frac{\\text{flux. } (z Y)}{z} = y, \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{flux. } (z X) = x \\dot{z} \\text{ flux. } (z Y) = y \\dot{z}. \\]\n\nTaking now the fluents of each side of these equations, and dividing by \\( z \\),\n\n\\[ X = \\int \\frac{x \\dot{z}}{z}, \\quad Y = \\int \\frac{y \\dot{z}}{z}; \\]\n\nIt is evident that by these two equations the position of \\( C \\) the centre of gravity is determined.\n\n168. Let us next suppose that it is required to find \\( C \\) Fig. 37., the centre of gravity of the plane area \\( APB \\). As the arch \\( AP \\) was in last \u00a7 supposed to receive the increment \\( Pp \\), so let the area \\( APB \\) now receive the increment \\( BPp \\), and let \\( C, C' \\) and \\( G \\) (which in the former case were supposed to be the centres of gravity of the arches \\( AP, APp, \\) and \\( Pp \\) respectively) now be supposed to be the centres of gravity of the areas \\( APB, A_p b, \\) and \\( BPPp \\); put the area \\( APB = r \\), the area \\( A_p b = r' \\), and let \\( X, Y, X', Y' \\) denote as before. Then, reasoning exactly as in last case, we have (by \u00a7 166.),\n\n\\[ s X + (z' - z) \\times GK = z' X', \\]\n\n\\[ s Y + (z' - z) \\times GH = z' Y' \\]\n\nhence...\n169. Let it next be required to find the centre of gravity of the surface of a solid generated by the revolution of the curve AP about AB as an axis. Let the surface of the solid be conceived to receive an increment generated by Pp an arch of the curve. In this case it is evident that the centres of gravity of the surface generated by the curve AP, the surface generated by the curve APp, and the surface generated by the arch PP, will each be in AB, the axis of the solid; suppose them to be at E, E' and H respectively. Put AE = X, AE' = X', also put s for the surface generated by AP, and s' for the surface generated by APp, then as before (from \u00a7 166.) we have\n\n\\[ sX + (s'-s)AH = s'X', \\]\n\nhence\n\n\\[ \\frac{s'X' - sX}{s-s} = AH, \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ \\text{flux.}(sX) = \\lim. AH. \\]\n\nbut the point p approaching to P, the limit of AH is manifestly AB or x, therefore\n\n\\[ \\text{flux.}(sX) = x, \\quad \\text{and } X = \\int \\frac{x}{s}, \\]\n\nor since \\( s = 2\\pi y^2 \\) (\\$ 65.), then\n\n\\[ X = \\frac{2\\pi \\int xy}{\\int y^2}. \\]\n\n170. If instead of the centre of gravity of the surface generated by AP, the centre of gravity of the solid generated by the revolution of the plane figure APB about AB as an axis be required, the reasoning will be the very same as in last \u00a7, substituting the solid generated by the plane figure instead of the surface generated by the curve line; so that putting s for the content of the solid, and X for AE the distance of its centre of gravity from the vertex, we have also\n\n\\[ X = \\int \\frac{x}{s}, \\]\n\nbut in this case \\( s = \\pi y^2 \\) (\\$ 64.), therefore\n\n\\[ X = \\frac{\\pi \\int y^2 x}{\\int y^2}. \\]\n\n171. We shall now apply these formulas to some examples.\n\nExample 1. Let it be required to find the centre of gravity of AP an arch of a circle. Suppose AB to be a part of the diameter, and in addition to the notation of \u00a7 167. put a for the radius of the circle, then from the nature of the curve, \\( y^2 = 2ax - x^2 \\), hence (proceeding as in \u00a7 165. Ex. 1.) we have \\( \\dot{x} = \\frac{a}{y} \\) and therefore \\( \\dot{y} = a \\dot{x} \\), and \\( \\ddot{x} = \\frac{a \\dot{x}}{y} \\), but from the equation \\( y^2 = 2ax - x^2 \\), by taking the fluxions we get \\( \\dot{y} = a \\dot{x} - x \\dot{x} \\), and hence \\( \\frac{\\dot{x}}{y} = \\frac{a \\dot{x}}{y} - \\dot{y} = \\dot{x} - \\dot{y} \\),\n\ntherefore \\( \\dot{x} = a(\\dot{x} - \\dot{y}) \\); substituting now the values of \\( \\dot{x} \\) and \\( \\dot{y} \\) in the formula of \u00a7 167 we have\n\n\\[ X = \\int \\frac{x \\dot{x}}{z} - \\frac{a}{z} \\int (\\dot{x} - \\dot{y}) \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{a}{z} (x - y + c) \\]\n\n\\[ Y = \\int \\frac{y \\dot{x}}{z} = \\frac{a}{z} \\int \\dot{x} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{a}{z} (x + c). \\]\n\nTo discover the values of the constant quantities c, c', we have from the equations in which they occur,\n\n\\[ ac = X - ax + ay, \\quad ac' = Y - ax; \\]\n\nbut when \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( x, y, X \\) and \\( Y \\) are each = 0, therefore \\( c = 0 \\), and \\( c' = 0 \\), thus we have simply\n\n\\[ X = \\frac{a(x-y)}{z}, \\quad Y = \\frac{ax}{z}. \\]\nEx. 2. Let it be required to find the centre of gravity of APB an area bounded by AP an arch of a circle and PB, BA its fine and verified fine. Let \\(a\\) denote the radius, and let the remaining notation be as in \u00a7168. Then, because \\(y = x^2\\), we have \\(x \\dot{s} = y \\dot{x}\\); but from the equation \\(y^3 = 2ax - x^3\\) (which expresses the nature of the curve), we find\n\n\\[x \\dot{s} = ax - y \\dot{y}, \\quad \\text{therefore}\\]\n\n\\[x \\dot{s} = ay \\dot{x} - y^2 \\dot{y} = ax - y^2 \\dot{y}.\\]\n\nWe have also \\(y \\dot{s} = y^2 \\dot{x} = (2ax - x^2) \\dot{x}\\), therefore,\n\n\\[X = \\frac{\\int x \\dot{s}}{\\dot{s}} = \\frac{\\int (ax - y^2 \\dot{y})}{\\dot{s}}\\]\n\n\\[= \\frac{1}{s}(ax - \\frac{1}{3}y^3 + c)\\]\n\n\\[Y = \\frac{\\int y \\dot{s}}{\\dot{s}} = \\frac{\\int (2ax - x^2) \\dot{x}}{\\dot{s}}\\]\n\n\\[= \\frac{1}{2s}(ax^2 - \\frac{1}{3}x^3 + c')\\]\n\nBy proceeding as in the last example we find \\(c\\) and \\(c'\\) each \\(= 0\\), thus we have\n\n\\[X = a - \\frac{y^3}{3s}, \\quad Y = \\frac{3}{2}ax^2 - \\frac{ax^3}{6s}.\\]\n\nEx. 3. Suppose now the figure to be the surface generated by the revolution of AP an arch of a circle about the diameter AB, and that the centre of gravity of the generated surface is required. Then because from the nature of the circle \\(x = \\frac{a \\dot{x}}{y}\\) we have \\(y \\dot{x} = ax\\), and \\(xy \\dot{s} = ax \\dot{x}\\), therefore, substituting these values in the formula of \u00a7169 it becomes\n\n\\[X = \\frac{\\int xy \\dot{s}}{\\int y \\dot{s}} = \\frac{\\int x \\dot{x}}{a \\dot{x}}\\]\n\n\\[= \\frac{1}{x+c'}.\\]\n\nTo find the values of the constant quantities \\(c\\), \\(c'\\), we have\n\n\\[c = X(x+c') - \\frac{1}{3}x^3,\\]\n\n\\[c' = \\frac{1}{3}x^3 + c - X.\\]\n\nbut as when \\(x = 0\\), then \\(X = 0\\), it is manifest that \\(c\\) and \\(c'\\) are each \\(= 0\\), thus we have\n\n\\[X = \\frac{1}{x}.\\]\n\nEx. 4. Let us now suppose that it is required to find the centre of gravity of the solid generated by the revolution of AP an arch of a circle about the diameter. In this case, because \\(y^3 = 2ax - x^3\\), we have from \u00a7170,\n\n\\[X = \\frac{\\int y^2 \\dot{x}}{\\int y \\dot{x}} = \\frac{\\int s(2ax - x^2)}{\\int s(ax - x^2)}\\]\n\n\\[= \\frac{1}{3}a x^3 - \\frac{1}{4}a^4 + c\\]\n\n\\[= \\frac{1}{3}a x^3 - \\frac{1}{4}a^4 + c'.\\]\n\nand reasoning as in the last example, we find \\(c = 0\\), and \\(c' = 0\\), and therefore\n\n\\[X = \\frac{8a x - 3x^3}{12a - 4x}.\\]\n\nIf the segment be a hemisphere, in which case \\(x = a\\), then \\(X = \\frac{3}{8}a\\).\n\nSect. III. Of Fluxional Equations.\n\n172. It has been shewn, (\u00a749.) how, from an equation being given, expressing the relation between \\(x\\) a variable quantity, and \\(y\\) a function of that quantity, we may deduce the equation that expresses the relation of their fluxions. We are now to show how from the latter, or fluxional equation, we may return to the equation of the fluents, which, relatively to the other, may be called its primitive equation.\n\n173. As any primitive equation and the fluxional equation derived from it both hold true at the same time, and as the constant quantities which enter into the former retain the same values in the latter, it follows that by means of the two equations we may extinguish any one of the constant quantities, and thus from any proposed primitive equation deduce a fluxional equation, in which one of the constant quantities contained in that primitive shall not at all be found.\n\nFor example let the primitive equation be \\(y + ax + b = 0\\), by taking the fluxions we have \\(y + ax = 0\\), a fluxional equation in which \\(b\\) is not found; if however it be required to find an equation in which \\(a\\) shall be wanting, we have only to eliminate \\(a\\) by applying the common rules of algebra (Algebra, Sect. vii.) to the two equations\n\n\\[y + ax + b = 0, \\quad y + ax = 0,\\]\n\nand hence we have \\(y + ax + b = 0\\), thus it appears that from the primitive equation \\(y + ax + b = 0\\) we may deduce a fluxional equation which may be expressed under either of these forms\n\n\\[y + ax = 0, \\quad y + ax + b = 0;\\]\n\nthese hold true at the same time as the primitive equation, they are alike related to it, and any two of the three being given the other necessarily follows from them.\n\nAs a second example, suppose the primitive equation to be \\(x^2 - 2ay - a^2 - b = 0\\), by passing to the fluxions we immediately find \\(x - a y = 0\\) an equation in which \\(b\\) is not found. If, however, it be required that the fluxional equation shall want \\(a\\), we have only to apply the common rules of elimination to the two equations; thus from the second we get \\(a = \\frac{x}{y}\\), and this being substituted in the first it becomes\nfrom which we have\n\n\\[(x^2 - b) \\dot{y}^2 - 2xy \\dot{y} \\dot{x} - x^2 \\dot{x}^2 = 0\\]\n\nand taking the square root, having previously reduced the equation to a proper form,\n\n\\[\\dot{y} \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 - b)} - y \\dot{y} - x \\dot{x} = 0.\\]\n\n174. It is evident that by proceeding in this manner we shall, in some cases, arrive at a fluxional equation involving the second and higher powers of \\(\\frac{y}{x}\\), and when this happens we can only find the value of \\(\\frac{y}{x}\\) by the resolution of an equation; but this may be avoided by preparing the primitive equation in such a manner, that the constant quantity to be eliminated may be entirely separated from the variable quantities, so as to form one of the terms of the equation, then, upon taking the fluxions, this term being constant will vanish, and thus we shall obtain an equation entirely free from the constant quantity contained in that term. Thus the primitive equation \\(y + ax + bx = 0\\) has already such a form that by taking the fluxions we get \\(y + ax = 0\\) an equation in which \\(b\\) is not found. If it be required, that upon taking the fluxions, \\(a\\) shall vanish; we must put the equation under this form \\(\\frac{y + b}{x} + a = 0\\), and then taking the fluxion, we find immediately\n\n\\[x \\dot{y} - (y + b) \\dot{x} = 0,\\]\n\nan expression in which \\(a\\) is not found, and which by rejecting the divisor \\(x\\) becomes \\(y \\dot{x} - x \\dot{y} + b \\dot{x} = 0\\), and these two forms of the fluxional equation are the very same as have been found in the last \u00a7. In the second example, viz. \\(x^2 - 2ay + b^2 = 0\\), the equation has already the form suited to the elimination of \\(b\\), for the fluxional equation is \\(x \\dot{x} - ay = 0\\), but in order that \\(a\\) may vanish, we must resolve the equation with respect to \\(a\\), so as to give it this form\n\n\\[y = \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 - b)} + a = 0;\\]\n\npassing now to the fluxional equation, \\(a\\) disappears, and we have\n\n\\[\\dot{y} \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 - b)} - y \\dot{y} - x \\dot{x} = 0\\]\n\nIt is evident that we have only to reject the denominator to give the equation this form\n\n\\[\\dot{y} \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 - b)} - y \\dot{y} - x \\dot{x} = 0\\]\n\nthe same as was found in the conclusion of last \u00a7.\n\n175. From what has been now shewn we may infer that as from any proposed primitive equation we can deduce a fluxional equation that shall contain one constant quantity less than the primitive contains, so on the contrary any fluxional equation being given, its primitive equation may contain one constant quantity more than the fluxional equation, but it can contain only one, for no more than one constant quantity can be made to disappear by returning from the primitive to its fluxional equation.\n\n176. The fluxional equation expressing the value of \\(\\frac{y}{x}\\), which is derived from any primitive equation involving \\(x\\), and \\(y\\) a function of \\(x\\), may be called a fluxional equation of the first order; and as from this equation considered as a primitive, we may, in like manner derive an equation that shall involve \\(\\frac{y}{x}\\) (\\$ 50.), this last may be called a fluxional equation of the second order, and the fluxional equation from which it is derived may be called its primitive equation of the first order, to distinguish it from the absolute primitive equation, from which all the others are conceived to be derived. A similar mode of definition is to be applied to the higher orders.\n\n177. As any primitive equation and the fluxional equations of the first and second orders derived from it must all hold true at the same time, it is evident, that by means of the three equations, we may exterminate any two of the constant quantities contained in them that we please, and thus produce a fluxional equation of the second order that contains two constant quantities less than the primitive equation. There are however two other ways by which we may arrive at the very same fluxional equation of the second order. For as from the given primitive equation we may deduce two different fluxional equations of the first order, one of which shall contain one only of the two quantities to be eliminated, and the other shall contain the other quantity only, we may consider each of these equations in its turn as a primitive, and, by proceeding in the manner explained in \u00a7 173 and \u00a7 174, derive from it a fluxional equation, in which that particular constant quantity which remained in its primitive, but which was to be finally eliminated, shall not be found; thus, from each of these primitives we shall deduce the very same fluxional equation of the second order, that shall be freed from two of the constant quantities contained in the absolute primitive equation.\n\nLet us take for example the equation\n\n\\[x^2 - 2ay + b^2 = 0;\\]\n\nby proceeding as explained in \u00a7 173, or \u00a7 174, we find these two fluxional equations of the first order,\n\n\\[x \\dot{x} - ay = 0, \\quad (x^2 + b^2) \\dot{y} - 2xy \\dot{x} = 0,\\]\n\nin the one of these, the constant quantity \\(a\\) is wanting, and in the other \\(b\\) is wanting. Taking the first equation \\(x \\dot{x} - ay = 0\\), and proceeding as in \u00a7 50 (observing that \\(x\\) is constant) we find \\(x \\dot{x} - ay = 0\\), if from this equation we now eliminate \\(a\\) by putting instead of it \\(\\frac{x \\dot{x}}{y}\\)\n\n(deduced from the equation \\(x \\dot{x} - ay = 0\\)) we find after proper reduction\nNow the fluent of \\( \\frac{m \\dot{x}}{x} \\) is \\( m.l.x + c' \\) (\\$103.) and in like manner the fluent of \\( \\frac{n \\dot{y}}{y} \\) is \\( n.l.y + c'' \\); therefore\n\n\\[ m.l.x + n.l.y + c' + c'' = 0, \\]\n\nor, transposing \\( c' + c'' \\), and putting a single constant quantity for their sum, which, to be homogeneous with the logarithmic quantities may be \\(-\\log_e c\\) or \\(-l.c\\),\n\n\\[ m.l.x + n.l.y = l.c, \\text{ or } l.(x^m) + l.(y^n) = l.c, \\]\n\nor \\( l.(x^m y^n) = l.c \\), and hence \\( x^m y^n = c \\),\n\nwhich last is the primitive equation required.\n\n180. When a primitive equation is homogeneous, that is when the sum of the exponents of the variable quantities \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is the same in each term, as in this example,\n\n\\[ ax + by + dx + ey + fy = 0 \\]\n\nor \\((ax + by)(x + (dx + ey))y = 0 \\)\n\nin which the variable part of each term is of the first degree, as also in this equation\n\n\\[ (ax + bx + dy + dy^2)x + (ex + fx + gy + gy^2)y = 0 \\]\n\nin which the variable part of each term is of the second degree, such an equation may be always transformed into another which will admit of the variable quantities being separated. To take a particular example, let us suppose the equation to be \\( x + y = nyx \\), or \\((x - ny)x + y = 0 \\). We assume \\( y = nx \\) (and the same assumption is to be made for any other homogeneous equation,) then \\( y = nx + nx \\), thus the equation becomes transformed to\n\n\\[ (x - nx)x + nx(nx + nx) = 0, \\]\n\nbut as the terms of this equation have a common factor \\( x \\), by leaving out that factor, it becomes\n\n\\[ (1 - nx)x + nx(nx + nx) = 0, \\]\n\nwhich also admits of being expressed thus\n\n\\[ (1 - nx + nx^2)x + nx^2 = 0, \\]\n\nand, by division\n\n\\[ \\frac{x}{x} + \\frac{nx}{1 - nx + nx^2} = 0, \\]\n\nand taking the fluents\n\n\\[ \\int \\frac{\\dot{x}}{x} + \\int \\frac{\\dot{x}}{1 - nx + nx^2} = C, \\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) denotes a constant quantity, or, since \\( \\int \\frac{\\dot{x}}{x} = l.x \\),\n\n\\[ l.x + \\int \\frac{\\dot{x}}{1 - nx + nx^2} = C, \\]\n\nnow\nnow the particular form of \\( \\int \\frac{z^2}{1 - n z + z^2} \\) depends upon the value of the number \\( n \\); for if \\( \\frac{n}{2} > 1 \\), it will be a logarithmic function, and if \\( \\frac{n}{2} < 1 \\), it will be expressible by means of a circle, but if \\( \\frac{n}{2} = 1 \\), then it is an algebraic function, and in each case it may be found by the methods delivered in Sect. I. for finding the fluent of a rational fraction. It may however, be simplified in its form, by observing, that since\n\n\\[\n\\frac{z^2}{1 - n z + z^2} = \\frac{2 z - n z}{1 - n z + z^2} + \\frac{n z}{1 - n z + z^2},\n\\]\n\ntherefore (\u00a7 103.) \\( \\int \\frac{z^2}{1 - n z + z^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int \\frac{2 z}{1 - n z + z^2} + \\frac{n z}{1 - n z + z^2}. \\)\n\nIf we limit our enquiry to the case of \\( n = 2 \\), we have\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{z^2}{1 - 2 z + z^2} = \\frac{2}{1 - z},\n\\]\n\nlet the terms be now collected into one expression, then observing that \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (1 - 2 z + z^2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (1 - z)^2 = 1 \\cdot (1 - z) \\), we have\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot (1 - z) + \\frac{1}{1 - z} = C;\n\\]\n\nand, substituting \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\) instead of \\( z \\),\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{x - y}{x} \\right) + \\frac{x}{x - y} = C,\n\\]\n\nor, substituting \\( 1 \\cdot c \\) instead of \\( C \\), and collecting the logarithmic functions into one,\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot \\frac{x - y}{c} = \\frac{-x}{x - y}\n\\]\n\ntherefore, passing from logarithms to numbers, by observing that, as when \\( a = 1 \\cdot p \\), we have by the nature of logarithms \\( e^a = p \\), where \\( e \\) denotes the number of which the Napierian logarithm is 1, so in the present case we have \\( \\frac{x - y}{c} = e^{-x/y} \\), and hence the primitive equation is found to be\n\n\\[\nx - y - c e^{-x/y} = 0.\n\\]\n\nAs a second example let the fluxional equation be\n\n\\[\nxy - y = x \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}\n\\]\n\nwhich is also homogeneous. Assume as before \\( y = x z \\), then \\( y = x z + x z \\), and substituting these values of \\( y \\) and \\( y \\) in the proposed equation, it becomes\n\n\\[\nx \\sqrt{(1 + z^2)} - x z = 0,\n\\]\n\nfrom which we get\n\n\\[\n\\frac{z}{x} \\sqrt{(1 + z^2)} = 0,\n\\]\n\nand taking the fluents of the terms, observing that each being a logarithm function, their sum may be put equal to a constant logarithm,\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{y + \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}}{x} \\right) = 1 \\cdot c,\n\\]\n\nwhich expression, by substituting for \\( z \\) its value \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\), becomes\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot c + 1 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{y + \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}}{x} \\right).\n\\]\n\nIf we now consider that\n\n\\[\n(y + \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2})(y - \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}) = -x^2,\n\\]\n\nand therefore that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y + \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}}{x} = \\frac{-x}{y - \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}},\n\\]\n\nit will appear, that the above equation may be otherwise expressed thus:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{-x}{y - \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}} \\right),\n\\]\n\nfrom which, by passing from logarithms to their numbers, we find \\( y - \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)} = -c \\), and hence, by so ordering the equation that the radical may disappear, we get \\( x^2 = c^2 + 2 c y \\), which is the primitive equation required.\n\n181. An equation which is not homogeneous, may in some cases, by proper transformations, be rendered homogeneous; this is the case in particular with the equation\n\n\\[\n(a + m x + n y) \\dot{x} + (b + p x + q y) \\dot{y} = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich is general of its kind; for this purpose we assume \\( x = t + u \\), and \\( y = u + \\beta \\), then \\( \\dot{x} = \\dot{t} \\), and \\( \\dot{y} = \\dot{u} \\); by substituting these values of \\( x, y, \\dot{x}, \\dot{y} \\), in the proposed equation it becomes\n\n\\[\n(a + m a + n \\beta + m t + n u) \\dot{t} + (b + p a + q \\beta + p t + q u) \\dot{u} = 0.\n\\]\n\nLet us now suppose \\( a \\) and \\( \\beta \\) such that\n\n\\[\na + m a + n \\beta = 0,\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb + p a + q \\beta = 0,\n\\]\n\nby these two equations the values of \\( a \\) and \\( \\beta \\) are determined, and the transformed equation is reduced to\n\n\\[\n(m t + n u) \\dot{t} + (p t + q u) \\dot{u} = 0,\n\\]\n\nan equation which is homogeneous, and therefore may be treated in the manner explained in last \u00a7.\n\nThis transformation will not apply however, when \\( m q - n p = 0 \\), because then the values of \\( a \\) and \\( \\beta \\) would be infinite.\nLet us take a particular case, and suppose the equation to be \\( y + y' = x^n \\), then we have \\( P = 1, Q = x^n \\), and \\( \\int P'x = x \\), hence in this case the general formula becomes\n\n\\[\ny = e^{-x} \\left\\{ \\int e^x x^n x' + c \\right\\}.\n\\]\n\nThe fluent \\( \\int e^x x^n x' \\) may be found by \u00a7 143; let us suppose for example that \\( n = 2 \\), then we have\n\n\\[\n\\int e^x x^2 x' = e^x (x^2 - 2x + 2),\n\\]\n\nso that the fluxional equation being\n\n\\[\ny' + y = x^2 x',\n\\]\n\nthe primitive equation is\n\n\\[\ny = x^2 - 2x + 2 + ce^{-x}.\n\\]\n\nThe general equation \\( y' + Py = Qx \\), which involves the simple power only of the variable quantity \\( y \\), and its fluxion, has been called a linear equation of the first order; it has also, with more propriety, been called a fluxional equation of the first degree, and of the first order.\n\n183. The equation\n\n\\[\ny' + Py = Qy^n x',\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) as before denote any functions of \\( x \\), is easily reduced to the form we have been considering; for assume \\( y^{1-n} = (1-n)x \\), then \\( y^{-n} y' = x \\), and \\( y = y^n \\); and \\( y = (1-n)y^n x' \\); if we now substitute the values of \\( y' \\) and \\( y \\) in the equation, it becomes\n\n\\[\ny^n x' + (1-n)P y^n x' = Q y^n x';\n\\]\n\nlet the terms of this equation be divided by \\( y^n \\), then, including the factor \\( (1-n) \\) in the indeterminate function \\( P \\), the result is\n\n\\[\nz + Px = Q x;\n\\]\n\nan equation of the very same form as that which has been considered in last \u00a7.\n\n184. The most general form that can be given to a fluxional equation of the first order, and consisting of three terms only, is\n\n\\[\ny u^i x^k x' + \\beta u^i x^b x' = \\alpha u^i x^f x';\n\\]\n\nto give this equation a more simple form let all its terms be divided by \\( y u^i x^f \\), it then becomes\n\n\\[\nx^i - f x' + \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} u^i x^b - f x' = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma} u^i - i x'.\n\\]\n\nSuppose now\n\n\\[\nx^i - f x' = \\frac{y}{k-f+1}, \\quad u^i x^b - f x' = \\frac{x}{g-i+1};\n\\]\n\nthen \\( x^i - f + 1 = y, \\quad u^i - i + 1 = x \\),\n\nand\nand \\( y + \\frac{(k-f+1)\\beta}{(g-i+1)\\gamma} y = \\frac{b-f}{g-i+1} x \\).\n\nLet us in order to abridge put\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(k-f+1)\\beta}{(g-i+1)\\gamma} = b, \\quad \\frac{(k-f+1)\\alpha}{(g-i+1)\\gamma} = a,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{h-f}{k-f+1} = n, \\quad \\frac{e-g}{g-i+1} = m,\n\\]\n\nthen the equation becomes\n\n\\[\ny + b y^n x = a x^m x.\n\\]\n\nIf we suppose \\( n = 1 \\), the resulting equation \\( y + b y x = a x^m x \\) may have its variable quantities separated by the method explained in \u00a7 183; but if we go only one step farther, and suppose \\( n = 2 \\) so that the equation is\n\n\\[\ny + b y^2 x = a x^m x,\n\\]\n\nthe difficulty of separating the variable quantities generally is so great as to have hitherto baffled the utmost efforts of the most expert analysts. This equation is commonly called Riccati's equation, on account of its having been first treated of by an Italian mathematician of that name, who succeeded in separating the variable quantities in some particular cases, namely, when \\( m \\) is equal to \\( \\frac{-4p}{2p-1} \\), where \\( p \\) denotes any whole positive number.\n\n185. If the separating of the variable quantities generally be a problem of insurmountable difficulty when the equation consists of only three terms, its solution can much less be expected, when the equation consists of four, or any greater number. There are, however, particular cases in which some of the most skilful analysts have, by employing happy and peculiar artifices, succeeded in resolving the problem, but the methods of proceeding are, generally speaking, not reducible to any determinate rules.\n\n186. When the expression which constitutes a fluxional equation is such as would be produced by taking the fluxion of some function of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), in which case it may be said to be a complete fluxion, then, without attempting to separate the variable quantities, we have only to add a constant quantity to that function, and the result put \\( = 0 \\), will evidently be the primitive equation required.\n\nIf, for example, the equation be \\( xy + yx = 0 \\), it is obvious that the expression \\( xy + yx \\) is immediately produced by taking the fluxion of the function \\( xy \\) ( \\( y \\) being also considered as a function of \\( x \\)), therefore the primitive equation is \\( xy + c = 0 \\).\n\nFrom the view which has been given in \u00a7 174, of the origin of fluxional equations it appears, that in passing from a primitive equation to its fluxional equation, the terms of the latter in many cases will not constitute a complete fluxion, by reason of some multiplier, or divisor, which was common to them all, having disappeared. In such cases, however, if we can by any means discover that factor, by restoring it we shall immediately have a complete fluxion, the fluent of which, with the addition of a constant quantity, when put \\( = 0 \\), will be the primitive equation.\n\nFor example, if the equation be \\( xy - yx = 0 \\), here \\( xy - yx \\) cannot be immediately produced by taking the fluxion of a function of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\); but, if we divide the equation by \\( x^2 \\) so as to give it this form \\( \\frac{xy - yx}{x^2} = 0 \\), we obtain the expression \\( \\frac{xy - yx}{x^2} \\) which is a complete fluxion, viz. that of the fraction \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\), therefore \\( \\frac{y}{x} + c = 0 \\), or \\( y + cx = 0 \\), is the primitive equation.\n\nIn like manner, the equation \\( mx + ny = 0 \\), which does not in its present form express a complete fluxion, yet becomes so when multiplied by \\( x^{n-1} y^{m-1} \\), for then it is\n\n\\[\nmx^n y^{m-1} + nx^{n-1} y^m = 0\n\\]\n\nfrom which it appears that the primitive equation in this case must be \\( x^n y^m + c = 0 \\).\n\n187. That we may be able to discover whether the terms of any proposed fluxional equation constitute a complete fluxion, and also from what expression such a fluxion has been derived, we must attend to the process, by which we find the fluxion of an expression composed of two variable quantities, one of which is a function of the other.\n\nTo avoid very general reasoning, we shall take for granted what is evidently possible, that any function of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) may be generally expressed by a formula of this nature.\n\n\\[\nAx^m y^n + Bx^p y^q + Cx^r y^s + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A, B, C, \\ldots \\) denote constant quantities, and the exponents \\( m, n, \\ldots \\) given numbers, the number of terms being supposed either finite or infinite. Now the fluxion of the whole expression is the sum of the fluxions of its terms, but in taking the fluxion of each term, beginning with the first \\( Ax^m y^n \\), the fluxion of which is\n\n\\[\nmAx^{m-1} y^n x + nAx^m y^{n-1} y,\n\\]\n\nit is evident that the result is composed of two parts, one of which is the expression we would find for its fluxion, if \\( x \\) only were considered as variable, and \\( y \\) as constant, and the other is the expression for its fluxion, if \\( y \\) only were considered as variable and \\( x \\) as constant; hence it follows, that the sum of the fluxions of all the terms will have the very same property; so that, if \\( u \\) be put for the whole expression, we shall in every case have\n\n\\[\nu = Mx + Ny\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( Mx \\) denotes the result that will be found if the fluxion of \\( u \\) be taken upon the hypothesis that \\( x \\) alone, is\nPart II.\n\nF L U X I O N S.\n\nInverse Method.\n\nis variable, and \\( N \\dot{y} \\) is the fluxion of \\( u \\), supposing \\( y \\) alone to be variable.\n\n188. Refining the consideration of the general expression\n\n\\[\nA x^m y^n + B x^p y^q + C x^r y^s + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nlet the fluxion of every one of its terms, for example, \\( A x^m y^n \\), be taken, supposing \\( x \\) alone variable, and the result is \\( m A x^{m-1} y^n \\). Again, let the fluxion of this result be taken, supposing \\( y \\) alone variable, and we find it to be \\( m n A x^{m-1} y^{n-1} \\). Now, if we first take the fluxion of \\( A x^m y^n \\), supposing \\( y \\) variable, we get \\( n A x^m y^{n-1} \\); and then, the fluxion of this result, considering \\( x \\) alone as variable, we get \\( mn A x^{m-1} y^{n-1} \\), which is the very same expression as was found by proceeding in a contrary order; and as the same must hold true of all the terms, we may conclude, that if the fluxion of \\( u \\) any function of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) be taken, considering \\( x \\) only as variable, and then the fluxion of that result, considering \\( y \\) only as variable, the very same final result will be obtained as if we were first to take the fluxion of \\( u \\) supposing \\( y \\) variable, and then the fluxion of that result, supposing \\( x \\) variable; but the fluxion of \\( u \\) being expressed thus, \\( M \\dot{x} + N \\dot{y} \\), it has been shown that \\( M \\dot{x} \\) is the fluxion of \\( u \\), if \\( x \\) only be supposed variable, and \\( N \\dot{y} \\) is its fluxion, if \\( y \\) only be variable, therefore, if we take the fluxion of \\( M \\dot{x} \\) upon the supposition that \\( y \\) only is variable, also the fluxion of \\( N \\dot{y} \\) upon the supposition that \\( x \\) only is variable, the results must be identical. This property affords the following rule, by which we may always determine whether any proposed expression constitutes an exact fluxion or not. Let the expression be put under this form \\( M \\dot{x} + N \\dot{y} \\); let \\( M' \\dot{y} \\) be the fluxion of \\( M \\), supposing \\( y \\) alone variable, and \\( N' \\dot{x} \\) the fluxion of \\( N \\) supposing \\( x \\) alone variable, then, if \\( M' \\) and \\( N' \\) are identical, \\( M \\dot{x} + N \\dot{y} \\) is a complete fluxion; and if they are not, \\( M \\dot{x} + N \\dot{y} \\) is not a complete fluxion.\n\n189. It is easy to see, how, from a complete fluxion \\( u = M \\dot{x} + N \\dot{y} \\) we may determine \\( u \\) its fluent; for as \\( M \\dot{x} \\) has been deduced from \\( u \\) by considering \\( x \\) as variable, and \\( y \\) as constant, on which account all the terms of \\( u \\) that involved \\( y \\) only must have vanished, it follows on the contrary, that if we put \\( Y \\) to denote those terms, we shall have\n\n\\[\nu = \\int M \\dot{x} + Y\n\\]\n\nthe fluent of \\( M \\dot{x} \\) being taken, regarding \\( x \\) only as variable. The function \\( Y \\) may be determined, by comparing the fluxion of the expression thus obtained with the given fluxion \\( M \\dot{x} + N \\dot{y} \\).\n\nEx. 1. Let the fluxion be\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a \\dot{y} + 2x \\dot{x} + y \\dot{x} + x \\dot{y}}{2 \\sqrt{(ay + x^2 + xy)}}\n\\]\n\nthis expression when reduced to the form \\( u = M \\dot{x} + N \\dot{y} \\) is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(2x + y) \\dot{x}}{2 \\sqrt{(ay + x^2 + xy)}} + \\frac{(a + x) \\dot{y}}{2 \\sqrt{(ay + x^2 + xy)}}\n\\]\n\nhence \\( M = \\frac{2x + y}{2 \\sqrt{(ay + x^2 + xy)}} \\), \\( N = \\frac{a + x}{2 \\sqrt{(ay + x^2 + xy)}} \\), the fluxion of \\( M \\), supposing \\( y \\) only variable, gives us\n\n\\[\nM' \\dot{y} = \\frac{(ay + xy - 2ax) \\dot{y}}{4(a y + x^2 + xy)^{\\frac{3}{2}}},\n\\]\n\nand in like manner the fluxion of \\( N \\), supposing \\( x \\) only variable, gives\n\n\\[\nN' \\dot{x} = \\frac{(ay + xy - 2ax) \\dot{x}}{4(a y + x^2 + xy)^{\\frac{3}{2}}},\n\\]\n\nhence it appears that \\( M' = N' \\), and therefore that the proposed expression is an exact fluxion. To determine its fluent, the formula \\( u = \\int M \\dot{x} + Y \\) gives us\n\n\\[\nu = \\sqrt{(ay + x^2 + xy)} + Y\n\\]\n\nthe fluxion of this expression taken, upon the supposition that both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are variable, is\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{a \\dot{y} + 2x \\dot{x} + y \\dot{x} + x \\dot{y}}{2 \\sqrt{(ay + x^2 + xy)}} + \\dot{Y}\n\\]\n\nthis result, compared with the original fluxion, shews that \\( \\dot{Y} = 0 \\), and \\( Y = c \\), a constant quantity.\n\nEx. 2. Suppose the fluxion to be\n\n\\[\n\\dot{x} \\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)} + \\dot{y} \\frac{(a^2 + xy + 2y^2)}{\\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)}}\n\\]\n\nHere \\( M = \\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)} \\), \\( N = \\frac{a^2 + xy + 2y^2}{\\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)}} \\), and by proceeding, as in last example, we shall find \\( M' = N' = \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)}} \\), hence it follows that the expression is a complete fluxion, and the formula \\( u = \\int M \\dot{x} + Y \\) shews that\n\n\\[\nu = \\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)} + Y\n\\]\n\nTo determine \\( Y \\), we take the fluxion of this expression, supposing \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) both variable, and find it to be\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\dot{x} \\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)} + \\frac{xy \\dot{y}}{\\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)}} + \\dot{Y},\n\\]\n\nand this compared with the original fluxion\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\dot{x} \\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)} + \\frac{(a^2 + xy + 2y^2) \\dot{y}}{\\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)}},\n\\]\n\nshews that \\( \\dot{Y} = \\frac{(a^2 + 2y^2) \\dot{y}}{\\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)}} \\), hence\n\n\\[\nY = \\int \\frac{(a^2 + 2y^2) \\dot{y}}{\\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)}} = y \\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)}\n\\]\n\ntherefore the fluent required is\n\\[ u = x \\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)} + y \\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)} + C \\]\n\\[ = (x + y) \\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)} + C, \\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) denotes a constant quantity.\n\n190. It may be demonstrated, that as often as a fluxional equation does not constitute a complete fluxion, there is always an infinite number of factors, such that if the equation were multiplied by any one of them, the result would be a complete fluxion. A general method of determining some one of these factors, however, seems to be a problem of such difficulty, that its solution, except in some particular cases, is not to be expected.\n\n191. When a fluxional equation involves the second or higher powers of \\( \\dot{x} \\) and \\( \\dot{y} \\), as in this example\n\n\\[ \\dot{y}^2 - a^2 \\dot{x}^2 = 0, \\]\n\nwhich may be put under this form,\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{y}^2}{\\dot{x}^2} - a^2 = 0, \\]\n\nwe may, by the theory of algebraic equations, deduce from it the values of \\( \\frac{\\dot{y}}{\\dot{x}} \\), considering this quantity as a root of the equation; thus, in the present example, by resolving the quadratic equation \\( \\frac{\\dot{y}^2}{\\dot{x}^2} - a^2 = 0 \\), we have\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{y}}{\\dot{x}} = \\pm a, \\]\n\nso that \\( \\dot{y} - a \\dot{x} = 0 \\) and \\( \\dot{y} + a \\dot{x} = 0 \\), hence\n\n\\[ y - ax + c = 0, \\quad y + ax + c' = 0, \\]\n\nare two primitive equations, from either of which the fluxional equation \\( \\dot{y}^2 - a^2 \\dot{x}^2 = 0 \\) may be derived, and it may also be deduced from their product\n\n\\[ (y - ax + c)(y + ax + c') = 0. \\]\n\n192. As often as the equation contains only one of the two variable quantities, for example \\( x \\), by the resolution of the equation we may obtain \\( \\frac{\\dot{y}}{\\dot{x}} = X \\) (where \\( X \\) denotes some function of \\( x \\)), and hence \\( y = \\int X \\dot{x} \\), but if it be more easy to resolve the equation with respect to \\( x \\) than to \\( \\frac{\\dot{y}}{\\dot{x}} \\) which we shall denote by \\( p \\), then, instead of seeking the values of \\( p \\) from the equation, we may find that of \\( x \\), thus we shall have \\( x = P \\), some function of \\( p \\), and hence \\( \\dot{x} = \\dot{P} \\), and since \\( \\dot{y} = p \\dot{x} \\); therefore, \\( y = p \\dot{P} \\), and \\( y = \\int p \\dot{P} = P \\int \\dot{P} \\). The relation between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is now to be found by eliminating \\( p \\) by means of the two equations\n\n\\[ x = P, \\quad y = P \\dot{P} = \\int \\dot{P}. \\]\n\nAs a particular example, let us suppose the equation to be \\( x \\dot{x} + ay = b \\sqrt{(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2)} \\), from which, by putting\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{y}}{\\dot{x}} = p \\] we find\n\n\\[ x = b \\sqrt{(1 + p^2)} - ap = P, \\]\n\n\\[ y = b p \\sqrt{(1 + p^2)} - \\frac{1}{2} a p^3 - b \\int \\dot{p} \\sqrt{(1 + p^2)}. \\]\n\nThe fluent of \\( \\dot{p} \\sqrt{(1 + p^2)} \\) may be found by the formulas given in \u00a7 130 and \u00a7 131.\n\n193. When we cannot by any means find an expression for the relation between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in finite terms, then we must, as a last resource, have recourse to approximation, that is, we must express the value of \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\) by means of a series.\n\nWhen the form of the series is known, we may determine the coefficients of its terms, by substituting the series and its fluxion instead of \\( y \\) and \\( \\dot{y} \\) in the proposed equation.\n\nSuppose, for example, that the equation is\n\n\\[ \\dot{y} + y \\dot{x} - mx^n \\dot{x} = 0 \\]\n\nwe may assume\n\n\\[ y = Ax^n + Bx^{n+1} + Cx^{n+2} + \\&c. \\]\n\nthen \\( \\dot{y} = nAx^{n-1} + (n+1)Bx^n + (n+2)Cx^{n+1} + \\&c. \\)\n\nSubstituting now the values of \\( y \\) and \\( \\dot{y} \\) in the equation, and dividing the whole by \\( \\dot{x} \\), it becomes\n\n\\[ A \\left( \\frac{n}{n+1} \\right) x^n + \\left( \\frac{n+1}{n+2} \\right) Bx^n + \\left( \\frac{n+2}{n+3} \\right) Cx^{n+1} + \\&c. = 0. \\]\n\nThis equation becomes identical, if we assume \\( n = m \\) or \\( n = m + 1 \\), and\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{m}{n}, \\quad B = \\frac{m}{n(n+1)}, \\quad C = \\frac{m}{n(n+1)(n+2)}, \\quad D = \\frac{m}{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}, \\quad \\&c. \\]\n\nHence we have\n\n\\[ y = m \\left\\{ \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} - \\frac{x^{n+2}}{(n+1)(n+2)} + \\frac{x^{n+3}}{(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)} + \\&c. \\right\\}. \\]\n\nIn order that a primitive equation may be general, it ought to contain an indeterminate constant quantity more than is found in the fluxional equation, therefore, this series which contains no such quantity, must be considered as incomplete, or as exhibiting the value of \\( y \\) upon the supposition, that, when \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( y = 0 \\).\n\nHowever, we may obtain a value of \\( y \\) that shall be general,\nPart II.","sp":387,"ep":399},{"h":"WATER IS FREED FROM VARIOUS IMPURITIES BY","t":"r is freed from various impurities by means of basins made of porous stones, which vessels must be peculiarly beneficial in long voyages, and even upon land they are of considerable benefit, when none but stagnant waters are to be found, or springs issuing through clay.\n\nA patent was granted in 1790 to a female potter, for inventing a composition to make filtering basins, as a succedaneum for that porous stone which is not every where to be found. She took four out of nine equal parts of tobacco-pipe clay, and five out of nine equal parts of sea, river, or pit sand, which she used for making small basins sufficient to contain one gallon of water. Her next proportions were equal parts of sea, river, or pit sand, and tobacco-pipe clay; her third proportions were three out of nine equal parts of tobacco-pipe clay; one out of nine equal parts of Stourbridge clay, or one out of nine equal parts of Windsor or other loam; and her fourth proportions were four out of eight equal parts of the burnt ground clay of which crucibles are made.\n\nA patent was also granted to Mr Joshua Collier of Southwark, for a most ingenious method of filtering and sweetening water, oil, and every other liquid. The following is the contrivance, which combines the application of machinery with the antiseptic properties of charcoal.\n\nFill oil is one of the liquids which he had particularly in view, to free it from everything disagreeable, either in taste, smell, or colour, to accomplish which he poured a quantity of oil into a convenient vessel, heated to the temperature of 120\u00b0 Fahrenheit's thermometer, adding caustic mineral alkali of the specific gravity of 1.25.

He then agitated the contents of this vessel, and left the coaly, saline, and aqueous particles to subside; afterwards passing it through proper strainers, when it became quite transparent and fit for use.\n\nThe principle of the improved filtering machines consists in combining hydrostatic pressure with the mode of filtering per a\u00ebreum, which procures the peculiar advantage of causing the fluid and its sediment to take opposite directions. The filtering surface remains the same, while the dimensions of the chamber in which the sediment is received may be varied. To adapt the machines to every purpose for which they are intended, chambers must be provided of various capacities, for the precipitated matter. The space required is very great with respect to the oil trade, and as all dimensions will be required occasionally, no particular limits can be fixed. For distilleries and breweries they may be smaller in proportion, and a very small chamber will be sufficient for domestic economy. If water is to be freed from noxious particles, it must be made to pass through an iron box in its way to the filtering chamber, and the box must contain charcoal finely powdered. The water is received into this box and delivered by two apertures, which are opened and closed by cocks.\n\nAnother part of the invention consists in filtering machines in the form of stills, in which charcoal may be repeatedly burnt after any fluid substances have passed through it, for the purpose of freeing them from noxious particles, or discharging their colouring matter.\n\nTo the filtering apparatus of Mr Collier, instruments are attached for discovering the comparative qualities of oils, which depend in some measure on their specific gravities; spermaceti oil, when compared with fish oils being as 875 to 920. To do this, a glass vessel of any shape most convenient is employed, with a glass bubble, and a thermometer. If the oil is pure, the bubble sinks, when the mercury rises to a particular standard. When spermaceti oil is impure, the bubble floats, though of the temperature required.\n\nTo determine the tendency of oils used for burning to congeal in cold weather, a freezing mixture may be put into a phial of thin glass, into which let a thermometer be immersed, and a single drop of the oil permitted to fall on the outside of the vessel, where it will instantly congeal. As the cold produced by the mixture decreases, let the temperature be observed by the thermometer at which the oil becomes fluid, and runs down the side of the glass.\n\nThe following is a short description of the apparatus contrived for this purpose. A (fig. 1, Plate CCXVII.) is the cistern, into which the water or other liquor to be filtered is put.

By means of this formula we may find the areas of that class of curves called spirals. Let us take for example the spiral of Archimedes, which may be defined thus. Conceive a straight line \\( FR \\) to revolve about \\( F \\) the centre of a given circle, departing from a given position \\( FB \\); conceive also a point \\( P \\) to move in the revolving line, so that \\( PF \\) its distance from the centre may be to \\( BD \\) the arch of the circle passed over by the revolving line, as \\( m \\) to \\( n \\), then the point \\( P \\) will generate the spiral.\n\nPut \\( BF = a \\), the angle \\( BFR = v \\), the line \\( FP = r \\), and the area generated by the line \\( FP = s \\), then the arch \\( BD = v \\), and since from the nature of the curve \\( r : av :: m : n \\), therefore \\( v = \\frac{nr}{am} \\), and \\( \\dot{v} = \\frac{nr}{am^2} \\); hence\n\nthe general formula \\( \\dot{s} = \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\dot{v} \\) becomes \\( \\dot{s} = \\frac{nr^2}{2am} \\),\n\ntherefore,\n\n\\[\ns = \\int \\frac{n r^2}{2am} = \\frac{nr^3}{6am}\n\\]\n\nthis fluent does not require a constant quantity to be added,\n156. As the general expression for a curvilinear area BCPD is $\\int y \\cdot x$, where $x = AB$ the abscissa reckoned from a given point A in the axis and $y = BC$ the ordinate, it follows that X being put to denote any function of a variable quantity $x$, the fluent of $X \\cdot x$ may always be exhibited by means of a curvilinear area. Thus let CP be a curve of such a nature that AD and DP the co-ordinates being denoted by $x$ and $y$, the equation of the curve is $y = X$, then, affixing any ordinate BC as given by position, we have evidently\n\n$$\\int X \\cdot x = \\text{area CBDP}.$$  \n\nAs the ordinate BC (which is assumed as given by position) may be taken anywhere, the fraction of the area being the same wherever it is taken, it appears, as has been already observed (\u00a7 101) that the function $\\int X \\cdot x$ may be considered as indeterminate, for it admits of innumerable values corresponding to any particular value of $x$, and in this respect it differs from an algebraic function, which for a given value of $x$ has always a determinate number of values. If however $x$ be supposed to increase from any determinate magnitude $a$, to any other determinate magnitude $a'$, then, taking the abscissa AD = $a$, and A d = $a'$, and drawing the ordinates DP, $d_p$, we have\n\nwhen $x = a$, $\\int X \\cdot x = \\text{area CBDP}$,\n\nand when $x = a'$, $\\int X \\cdot x = \\text{area CBdP}$,\n\ntherefore, while $x$ increases from $a$ to $a'$, or receives the increment $a' - a$, the function $\\int X \\cdot x$ increases from area CBDP to area CBdP, and thus receives the increment area PD $d_p$, which is of a determinate magnitude as the ordinates PD, $d_p$ have both a determinate position.\n\nHence it appears that in affixing the fluent of $X \\cdot x$, we only determine the change that takes place in the value of the function $\\int X \\cdot x$ while $x$ passes from one particular value to another particular value.\n\n157. As there are general and known methods by which an approximate value of any curvilinear area may be found, when a fluent is expressed by such an area, those methods may be applied to find an approximate value of the fluent. Let PD $d_p$ be a curvilinear area, supposed to represent the fluent $\\int X \\cdot x$ between the limits of $x = AD$ and $x = A.d$. Conceive D$d$ to be divided into a number of equal parts DD', D'D'', D'd', and the ordinates PD', P'D'' drawn, and the two sets of parallelograms DE, D'E', D''E'' and D'e', d'e' to be completed, the former constituting a rectilineal figure circumscribed about the curvilinear space DPP'D'P'd', and the latter a rectilineal figure inscribed in that space; then as the circumscribed figure must necessarily be greater than the curvilinear space, that is, greater than\n\n$$\\int X \\cdot x \\text{ taken between the limits of } x = AD \\text{ and } x = A.d,$$\n\nand the inscribed figure must be less, it follows that if we compute the areas of the circumscribed and inscribed figures we shall obtain two limits, the one greater, and the other less than $\\int X \\cdot x$. And as by increasing the number of equal parts into which D$d$ is divided we may bring the circumscribed and inscribed rectilineal figures as near to a ratio of equality as we please, it is always possible to find two limits which shall differ from each other, and consequently from $\\int X \\cdot x$ (which lies between them) by less than any assignable quantity.\n\n158. If we join P, P', P'', P, the tops of the ordinates, the rectilineal space formed by the trapeziums DPP'D', D'P'P''D'', D''P''P'd' will be more nearly equal to the curvilinear area, than the circumscribed rectilineal figure formed by the parallelograms DE, D'E', D''E''; therefore the sum of those trapeziums being found, it will be equal to the fluent $\\int X \\cdot x$ nearly.\n\nSuppose, for example, that it is required to find the value of $\\int \\frac{x}{1 + x^2}$ between the limits of $x = 0$, and $x = 1$.\n\nIn this case $X = \\frac{1}{1 + x^2}$, so that the equation of the curve $P_p$ is $y = \\frac{1}{1 + x^2}$; let us suppose $D_d$ the distance between the extreme ordinates to be divided into ten equal parts, then putting 0, '1, '2, &c. to 1 instead of $x$ in the formula $y = \\frac{1}{1 + x^2}$, we obtain eleven successive values of $y$, or eleven equidistant ordinates, the numerical values of which will be as follows,\n\n| The first | 1.00000 |\n|----------|---------|\n| the 2d   | .99010  |\n| the 3d   | .96154  |\n| the 4th  | .91743  |\n| the 5th  | .86207  |\n| the 6th  | .80000  |\n| the 7th  | .73529  |\n| the 8th  | .67114  |\n| the 9th  | .60975  |\n| the 10th | .55249  |\n| the 11th | .50000  |\n\nBy the elements of geometry the area of the rectilineal figure formed by the trapeziums is found by adding together all the ordinates except the first and last, and half the sum of the first and last, and multiplying that sum by the breadth of one of the trapeziums; now the sum of the ordinates, with the exception of the first and last, together with half the sum of the first and last, is 7.84981, and the common breadth of the trapeziums is '1, therefore $\\int \\frac{x}{1 + x^2} = 7.84981 \\times '1 = '785$ nearly, as required. It is evident from \u00a7 137, that $\\int \\frac{x}{1 + x^2}$ taken between the limits of $x = 0$, and $x = 1$, is accurately equal to an arch of 45\u00b0, radius being unity, which arch being $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi$ will be found = '7854 nearly.\n\nIf we recur to the series which has been found to express the above fluent in \u00a7 137, and put $a = 1$, and $x = 1$, we shall have $\\int \\frac{x}{1 + x^2}$ taken between the prescribed limits equal to\nIt is impossible however to compute the fluent simply by the addition of the terms of this series, on account of the slowness of its convergency.\n\n159. As the curvilinear area $DP\\cdot d$ is the limit of the sum of the parallelograms $DP', DP'', \\ldots$, which constitute the rectilineal figure inscribed in that area; as also the limit of the sum of the parallelograms $DE, DE', DE'', \\ldots$, which constitute the circumscribed figure, the number of parts into which $D\\cdot d$ is divided being in either case conceived to be increased indefinitely, so that each may be continually diminished (and this being the case it is of no consequence whether those parts be conceived as all equal or as unequal) so from analogy we may conclude that if $x', x'', x''', \\ldots x^{(n)}$ be put to denote successive values of a variable quantity $x$, and $X', X'', X''', \\ldots X^{(n)}$ the corresponding values of $X$ any function of $x$, the limit of the sum of the products $X(x' - x), X(x'' - x'), X(x''' - x''), \\ldots$, &c., when the number of successive values of $x$ and $X$ is continually increased, so that the difference between any two of them immediately following each other may be continually diminished, is equal to $\\int X\\cdot dx$, the fluent to be taken between the two extreme values of $x$.\n\n160. It was in this manner that the first writers on the differential calculus conceived a fluent; as the difference between any two of its succeeding values is the product of the function $X$ by $x' - x$ the increment of $x$; they called that product (when $x' - x$ was conceived to be infinitely diminished) the Differential of the fluent; and as the fluent is the sum of all the products, or differentials, instead of calling it a fluent they called it an Integral; the process by which an integral is found from its differential or fluxion they called Integration. The terms Integral and Integration are sometimes employed by writers in applying the method of fluxions to mathematical enquiries.\n\nTo find the Lengths of Curves.\n\n161. It has been shewn in \u00a7 63, that if the abscissa of a curve be denoted by $x$, the ordinate by $y$, and the curve line by $z$, then $z = \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}$, hence the general formula for finding the length of a curve is\n\n$$z = \\int \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}.$$  \n\nTherefore, if from the equation expressing the nature of a curve we find the value of $y$ in terms of $x'$ and $x$, or else the value of $x'$ in terms of $y$ and $y'$, and substitute the one or the other in the above general formula, we shall obtain a fluxion the fluent of which will be the length of the curve.\n\nEx. 1. Suppose the curve to be a parabola, and that $AB = x$, $BP = y$, the arch $AP = z$, the parameter $= a$, then the equation of the curve being $ax = y^2$, we have\n\n$$x = \\frac{2yy}{a},$$  \n\nand\n\n$$z = \\int \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}.$$  \n\nThis fluent can only be expressed by an infinite series, under which form it has been already exhibited in \u00a7 149, the radius being there supposed unity.\n\nEx. 2. Suppose the curve to be a circle, and that $C$ Fig. 20 is its centre, and $AE$ a quadrant of the circle. Put $CB = x$, $BP = y$, the arch $EP = z$, the radius of the circle $= a$, then $x^2 + y^2 = a^2$, and $y = \\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)}$, and\n\n$$y = \\frac{-xx}{\\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)}},$$  \n\nhence\n\n$$z = \\int \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)} = \\int \\sqrt{(x^2 + \\frac{x^2}{a^2 - x^2})}.$$  \n\nEx. 3. Let the curve be an ellipse, and let it be required to find the length of the curve between $E$ the vertex of the lesser axis, and $P$ any point in the curve. To simplify the calculation, let us suppose that the semi-transverse axis $AC = a$; put the semi-conjugate axis $CE = b$, the eccentricity (that is $\\sqrt{(1 - b^2)} = e$, the abscissa $CB = x$, the ordinate $PB = y$, the arch $EP = z$; then, the equation of the curve being $y^2 = b^2(1 - x^2)$, we have\nPart II.\n\nInverse Method, have \\( y = b \\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\), and \\( y' = \\frac{-b x}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \\), and therefore\n\n\\[ z = \\int \\sqrt{x^2 + y'^2} = \\int \\sqrt{x^2 + \\frac{b^2 x^2}{1 - x^2}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\int \\frac{x \\sqrt{1 - e^2 x^2}}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \\]","sp":384,"ep":387}]
