[{"h":"CLYSTERS","t":"This form is suited to a great variety of purposes, and is not administered so often as with propriety it might be given. Not only purges, which are very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> administered in this way, but also every class of remedies, may be exhibited in the form of a clyster. The clyster should be composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> substances that are not either entirely soluble in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> may be thoroughly mixed with any watery fluid, as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> readily through a slender tube.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> employed for administering a clyster is, as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> subject, a pipe and bladder, but the bladder should be that of an ox, and of the largest size; to the extremity of which must be fitted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEWTER\">pewter</a> pipe about a foot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, and about half an inch in diameter, having the extremity which is to enter the gut made completely smooth, that it may not injure the internal coat of the bowel.\n\nPrevious to administering a clyster, it is often necessary to free the great gut from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of hardened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCREMENT\">excrement</a> which it may contain. This is best performed by means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and the operation is called raking, or back-raking. The hand is easily introduced, as the diameter of the great gut is in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>. Care must be taken before introducing the hand, to grease it well with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> or hogs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-LARD\">lard</a>, and to have the nails cut perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>, for fear of injuring the gut. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of extracting the hardened excrement is frequently required, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> succeed when medicine would probably only serve to increase the animal's distress.\n\nLarge syringes are frequently employed for the purpose of administering clysters; but such instruments are exceedingly improper, as their tubes are very short, and they are very difficult to manage, especially <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the animal should prove restless from pain, as frequently happens in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of colic; where, as we shall see, clysters are very frequently required.\n\nClysters are peculiarly requisite in those cases where medicine cannot be conveniently given by the mouth; as in locked-jaw, or when there is any obstruction in the throat, or wound of the tongue. In such circumstances horses may frequently be kept alive for many weeks, by the frequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of nourishing clysters.","sp":79,"ep":79},{"h":"DRENCHES","t":"This form is chiefly suited to those remedies that are easily soluble in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> which readily mix with that fluid, and which have not any very disagreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. Hence all mucilaginous substances, some resins, and many of the aromatics, may be given in this form. It is proper, in compounding a drench, that the substances composing it be thoroughly mixed with each other. It not unfrequently happens, that oils or balsams are given by way of drench, without any pains having been taken to combine them fully with the watery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the medicine; and when substances that would admit of being finely powdered, are administered in this way, the carelessness of grooms or farriers is too often such as to give them in a very coarse state. In the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> or balsam <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a> in the liquid hangs about the mouth and throat of the animal, and by its unpleasant taste renders him averse to the repetition of the medicine; in the latter case, it is evident that the remedy is not reduced to that state in which it is capable of exerting its full effect.","sp":78,"ep":79},{"h":"DRENCHES ARE USUALLY ADMINISTERED BY","t":"s are usually administered by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>, which is that of an ox <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> cow, with the larger end cut into the form of a spout. Sometimes when a horn is not at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, a bottle is employed; but this is very improper, as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>'s struggling, which often happens in administering a drench, the neck of the bottle may be broken, and occasion much mischief.\n\nIn giving a drench by means of the horn, the animal's tongue is to be held <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> with the left hand, as in giving a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>; and when his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> is sufficiently raised, the drench is to be poured cautiously into his mouth. Every stable should be provided with a drenching horn.\n\nIn preparing drenches, farriers almost always make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of ale or beer, as the menstruum or diluent; but this is often very absurd, and can be proper only in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of cordial drenches. Those of a cooling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> should be mixed, either with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, or with some mucilaginous infusion.\n\nDrenches are seldom given with dexterity, and thus a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of the medicine is frequently spilled. This circumstance renders them often very inconvenient, particularly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> where there is any swelling or painful affection either of the mouth or throat. Under such circumstances it is scarcely advisable to administer medicine in the form of a drench; as, independently of the resistance given by the horse, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> certainly waste much of the medicine, the forcing of a drench down his throat, when it is in an inflamed or irritable state, may be followed by very unpleasant consequences. Mr Clark says that he has frequently observed a simple solution of nitre in water, sweetened with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a> or molasses, when given in cases such as we have described, to occasion violent coughing, trembling and panting, inasmuch that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> animal was like to drop down, merely from the acute pain he suffered, from a medicine being administered to him in the form of a drench at such a critical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>.\n\nEven the position in which the horse's head is placed to receive a drench may, in these cases, excite the most violent pain, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> which the muscles of the throat undergo, when the head and tongue are held in so awkward a situation.\n\nThe great advantage of a drench is, that remedies exhibited in this form produce their effect much more speedily than when given in the form of a ball, which may take a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to be dissolved in the juices of the stomach. Drenches are therefore particularly suited to urgent cases, in which it is necessary to give immediate relief.","sp":79,"ep":79},{"h":"END OF THE EIGHTH VOLUME","t":"ERRATA IN <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUXIONS\">FLUXIONS</a>.\n\nPage.

This idea of fairies has a near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> with that of the Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, concerning the nymphs of the woods, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>; and an ancient scholiast on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEOCRITUS\">Theocritus</a> says, \"The nymphs are demons which appear on the mountains in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of women;\" and what is more surprising, the Arabs and other orientals have their ginn and peri, of whom they entertain the like notions.\n\nBut fairies have been likewise described as of either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, and generally as of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> stature, though capable of assuming various forms and dimensions. The most charming representation imaginable of these children of romantic fancy, is in the Midsummer Night's Dream of Shakespeare; in referring to which, we no doubt have been anticipated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a> of almost every reader.\n\nSpenser's Faery Queene is an epic poem, under the persons and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of fairies. This sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> raises a pleasing kind of horror in the mind of the reader, and amuses his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> with the strangeness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> of the persons who are represented in it; but, as a vehicle of instruction, the judicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> to it, as not having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> enough to make any moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of fairies still subsists in many parts of our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. The\n\n\"Swart fairy of the mine\"\n\n(of German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a>), has scarce yet quitted our subterraneous works; (vid. next article.)

The Germans believed in two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>; one fierce and malevolent: the other a gentle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, appearing like little old men dressed like the miners, and not much above two feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>. These wander about the drifts and chambers of the works; seem perpetually employed,\nFAIRY Circle or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">Ring</a>, a phenomenon pretty frequent in the fields, &c., supposed by the vulgar to be traced by the fairies in their dances. There are two kinds of it; one of about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> yards in diameter, containing a round bare path, a foot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, with green grass in the middle of it. The other is of different bigness, encompassed with a circumference of grass. Messrs. Jessop and Walker, in the Philosophical Transactions, ascribe them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>; which is thought to be confirmed by their being most frequently produced after storms of that kind, as well as by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> and brilliancy of the grass roots when first observed. Lightning, like all other fires, moves round, and burns more in the extremity than in the middle: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> circle arises from the first, the grass burnt up growing very plentifully afterwards. Others maintain that these circles are made by ants, which are frequently found in great numbers therein.\u2014Mr. Cavallo, in his treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a>, does not think that lightning is at all concerned in the formation of them: \"They are not (says he) always of a circular figure; and, as I am informed, they seem to be rather beds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MUSHROOMS\">mushrooms</a> than the effects of lightning.\"\n\nWe have frequently observed beds of mushrooms arranged in a circular form like what are called fairy rings; but it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be difficult to account for the mushroom feed being disposed in this manner. It is probable that the feed is dispersed over the whole field, and remains dormant till it is acted on by some stimulus to excite its vegetating powers. Perhaps this stimulus is atmospheric electricity, which acting on particular spots only, produces on them an abundant crop of mushrooms, while none appear in other places.","sp":5,"ep":6},{"h":"FAITH","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">Theology</a>, that assent which we give to a proposition advanced by another, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of which we do not immediately perceive from our own reason <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>; or it is a judgment or assent of the mind, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> whereof is not any intrinsic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, but the authority or testimony of some other who reveals or relates it.

While they\nremained in the cities on the Red Sea, they exercised\nthe trade of brick and tile making, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POTTERY\">pottery</a>, thatching\nhouses, &c., and after leaving the sea coasts, they chose\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> of Dembea on account of the plenty of\nmaterials afforded for exercising the trades they pro-\nfessed. Here they carried the art of pottery to a\ngreat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of perfection, multiplied exceedingly,\nand became very numerous and powerful about the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that the Abyssinians were converted to Chris-\ntianity. As this event was accounted by them an apo-\ntasy from the true religion, they now separated them-\nselves from the Abyssinians, and declared one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHINEAS\">Phineas</a>,\nof the line of Solomon, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>.

About the year 960,\nthe queen of this people, after extirpating the Abyssi-\nnian princes on the rock Damo, assumed the sover-\neignty of the whole empire, which they retained for\nsome time; but their power being by degrees reduced,\nthey were obliged to take up their residence among the\nrugged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> of Samen; one of which they chose\nfor their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, and which has ever since been called\nthe Jew's Rock.

When Mr Bruce was in Abyssinia they\nwere supposed to amount to about 100,000 effective\nmen.

On being interro-\ngated concerning it by Mr Bruce, they said, that it\nwas probably one of those spoken by the nations on the\nRed Sea, among whom they had settled at their first\ncoming. They arrived in Abyssinia speaking Hebrew,\nand with the advantage of having books in that lan-\nguage; but had now forgot it, which indeed is not to\nbe wondered at, as they had lost their Hebrew books,\nand were entirely ignorant of the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>.

The Scots generals placed their pikemen along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a>, and lined the intervals between the three bodies of which their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> was composed, with archers; and dreading the great superiority of the English cavalry, endeavoured to secure their front by palliadoes tied together with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a>.

Wallace alone preferred entire the troops he commanded; and retiring behind the Carron, marched leisurely along the banks of that river, which protected him from the enemy. In this battle fell John de Graham, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> much celebrated for his valour, and styled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of the gallant Wallace.

See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTEDILUVIANS\">Antediluvians</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">Original</a> Sin. The account which Moses gives of this transaction is extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> and concise. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENT\">serpent</a>, he informs us, being more subtle than any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a> of the field, asked the woman, whether it was true that God had not granted her and her husband leave to eat of every tree in the garden? She answered, That God had allowed them to eat of all, except only the fruit of the tree in the midst of the garden; which he commanded they should not taste, nor so much as touch, lest they should die. The serpent replied, That they should not die; for God knew the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of the tree; and that, so soon as they ate of it, their eyes would be opened, and they would become like gods, knowing good and evil. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVE\">Eve</a>, seeing the fruit tempting to the view, took of the fruit and ate; and gave also to her husband of it, and he did eat. Immediately the eyes of both were opened; when perceiving they were naked, they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons. Adam and Eve, hearing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of God walking in the garden in the cool of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, hid themselves among the trees; but, on God's calling for Adam, he excused himself for not appearing, because he was naked. God demanded of him, who it was that told him he was naked; and whether he had disobeyed his command, in eating the forbidden fruit? Adam confessed that the woman had offered him the fruit, and he had tasted it. She, being examined likewise, acknowledged what she had done; but said, the serpent had seduced and deceived her. God then proceeded to judgment; he first cursed the serpent above all beasts, and condemned him to go on his belly, and eat the dust; adding, that he would put enmity between him and the woman, and their offspring; that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, who should bruise the other's heel. The woman was subjected to the pains of childbirth, as well as to the dominion of her husband; and as to the man, God cursed the ground for his sake, declaring, that it should bring forth thorns and thistles, and he should earn his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> by the sweat of his brow, till he returned to the dust, from whence he was taken. At last, having clothed them both with skins, he turned them out of the garden, lest they should take of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever; then, to prevent any attempt to return to their former habitation, he placed cherubims at the east of the garden, and a flaming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> which turned every way, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> the passage to the tree of life.\n\nThis concise account being, at first view, encumbered with some difficulties, several learned and pious men have been inclined to believe the whole ought to be taken in an allegorical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, and not according to the strictness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>: they allege, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, and particularly the eastern nations, had two different ways of delivering their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, one popular, and the other mysterious; that the Scripture uses both occasionally; sometimes accommodating itself to the capacities of the people, and at other times to the real but more veiled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>; and that, to obviate the many difficulties which occur in the literal history of this sad catastrophe, the safest way is to understand it as a parabolical story, under which the real circumstances are disguised and concealed, as a mystery not fit to be more explicitly declared.\n\nThough it cannot be denied that some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> philosophers affected such an allegorical way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, to conceal their notions from the vulgar, and keep their learning within the bounds of their own school; yet it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> Moses had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>; and as he pretends only to relate matters of fact, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as they happened, without art or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a>, it cannot be supposed that this history of the fall is to be taken in a literal sense, as well as the rest of his writings. It is generally agreed, that the serpent which tempted Eve was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a>, who envying the privileges of man in innocence, tempted him, and was the cause of his forfeiting all those advantages which he had received from God at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>; and that to this end he assumed the form of a serpent. These interpretations are supported by many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of Scripture, where the devil is called the serpent, and the old serpent. (See John viii. 44. 2 Cor. xi. 3. and Rev. xii. 9.) Some believe that the serpent had then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of speech, and conversed familiarly with the woman, without her conceiving any distrust of him; and that God, to punish the malice with which he had abused Eve, deprived him of the use of speech. Others maintain, that a real serpent having eaten of the forbidden fruit, Eve from thence concluded, that she too might eat of it without danger; that in effect she did eat of it, and incurred the displeasure of God by her disobedience. This, say these last authors, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of fact which Moses would relate under the allegorical representation of the serpent conversing with Eve.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of such as believe this was not a real serpent, but only the devil under that name, is no less liable\nliable to exception than any of the rest. For though the devil is frequently styled in Scripture the serpent, and the old serpent, yet why he should be called the most subtle beast of the field, we cannot conceive; neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> inflicted on the serpent suffer us to doubt, but that a serpent's body at least was employed in the transaction.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the forbidden fruit is another circumstance in this relation that has occasioned no less variety of conjectures. The Rabbins believe it was the vine; others that it was wheat; and others, from the circumstance of Adam and Eve's covering themselves with fig leaves immediately after their transgression, tell us, that this fruit must have been the fig; some think it was the cherry; and the generality of the Latins will have it to be the apple.\n\nThose who admire allegorical interpretations, will have the forbidden fruit to have been no other than the sensual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>, for which the punishment inflicted on the woman was the pain of childbirth. But this opinion has not the least foundation in the words of Moses, especially <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we consider that Adam knew not his wife till after their expulsion out of Paradise.\n\nMany have been the suppositions and conjectures upon this subject in general; and some have so far indulged their fancy in the circumstances of the fall, that they have perverted the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NARRATION\">narration</a> of Moses into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> full of the most shameful extravagancies.","sp":10,"ep":12},{"h":"FALLACY","t":"a deception, fraud, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> false appearance.\n\nThe Epicureans deny that there is any such thing as a fallacy of the senses: for, according to them, all our sensations and perceptions, both of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> and phantasy, are true; whence they make sense the primary criterion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>.\n\nThe Cartesians, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, maintain, that we should suspect as false, or at most as dubious, everything that presents itself to us by means only of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> senses, because they frequently deceive us.

The two outer ones are bigger and stronger than the others. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of sticks rarely exceeds 22. The sticks are usually provided by the cabinetmakers or toymen; the fan-painters plait the papers, paint, and mount them.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> is either in colours or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>, applied on a silvered ground, both prepared by the goldbeaters. Sometimes they paint on a gold ground, but it is rarely; true gold being too dear, and false too paltry. To apply the silver leaves on the paper, they use a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, which they pretend is a great secret, but which appears to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> arabic, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDY\">candy</a>, and a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>, melted in common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and mixed with a little brandy.

When, instead of silver, gold ground is laid, the same method is observed.

Whence a farm was originally a place that furnished its landlord with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>. And among the Normans they still distinguished between farms that pay in kind, i.e., provisions, and those which pay in money; calling the former simply fermetes, and the latter blanche ferme, \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> farm.\"\n\nSpelman shows, that the word firma, anciently signified not only what we now call a farm, but also a feast or entertainment, which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> gave the proprietor or landlord, for a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of days, and at a certain rate, for the lands he held of him. Thus feorme in the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> Canute is rendered by Mr Lambard, victus: and thus we read of reddere firmam unius noctis, and reddebat unum diem de firma; which denote provision for a night and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, the rents about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the conquest being all paid in provisions; which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> is said to have been first altered under King Henry I.

See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a>.\n\nFarm, as connected with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARDENING\">gardening</a>, and susceptible of embellishment. See Gardening.\n\nIn speculation, it might have been expected that the first essays of improvement should have been on a farm, to make it both advantageous and delightful; but the fact was otherwise: a small plot was appropriated to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>; the rest was reserved for profit only. And this may, perhaps, have been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> cause of the vicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> prevailed in gardens. It was imagined that a spot set apart from the rest should not be like them: the conceit introduced deviations from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, which were afterwards carried to such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, that hardly any objects truly rural were left within the enclosure, and the view of those without was generally excluded. The first step, therefore, towards a reformation, was by opening the garden to the country, and that immediately led to assimilating them; but still the idea of a spot appropriated to pleasure only prevailed, and one of the latest improvements has been to blend the useful with the agreeable; even the ornamental farm was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> in time to the more rural; and we have at last returned to simplicity by force of refinement.\n\n1. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of pastoral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> seem now to be the standard of that simplicity; and a place conformable to them is deemed a farm in its utmost purity. An allusion to them evidently enters into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of the Leafoves (A), where they appear so lovely as to endear the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of their author; and justify the reputation of Mr Shenstone, who inhabited, made, and celebrated the place: it is a perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of his mind, simple, elegant, and amiable; and will always suggest a doubt, whether the spot inspired his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>, or whether, in the scenes which he formed, he only realized the pastoral images which abound in his songs. The whole is in the same taste, yet full of variety; and, except in two or three trifles, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> is rural and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a>. It is literally a grazing farm lying round the house; and a walk, as unaffected and as unadorned as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> field-path, is conducted through the several enclosures. But for a detail of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> and scenery, as illustrative of the present subject, the reader is referred to the particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the Leafoves published by the late Mr Dodtley. We shall only take notice of one or two circumstances independent on the general delineation.\n\nThe art with which the divisions between the fields are diversified is one of them. Even the hedges are distinguished from each other: a common quickset <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FENCE\">fence</a> is in one place the separation: in another, it is a lofty hedge-row, thick from the top to the bottom; in a third, it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> range of trees, with all their stems clear, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> appearing in the intervals between their boughs, and the bushes beneath them; in others, these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of trees are broken, a few groups only being left at different distances; and sometimes a wood, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROVE\">grove</a>, a coppice, or a thicket, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> boundary, and by them both the shape and the style of the enclosures are varied.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSCRIPTIONS\">inscriptions</a>, which abound in the place, are another striking peculiarity: they are well known and justly admired; and the elegance of the poetry, and the aptness of the quotations, atone for their length and their number. But, in general, inscriptions please <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more than once: the utmost they can pretend to, except when their allusions are emblematical, is to point out the beauties, or describe the effects, of the spots they belong to; but those beauties and those effects must be very faint, which stand in need of the assistance. Inscriptions, however, to commemorate a departed friend, are evidently exempt from the censure; the monuments would be unintelligible without them; and an urn, in a lonely grove, or in the midst of a field, is a favourite embellishment at the Leafoves: they are indeed among the principal ornaments of the place; for the buildings are mostly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> seats, or little root-houses; a ruin of a priory is the largest, and that has no peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> to recommend it; but a multiplicity of objects are unnecessary in the farm; the country it commands is full of them; and every natural advantage of the place within itself has been discovered, applied, contrated, and carried to the utmost perfection, in the purest taste, and with inexhaustible fancy.\n\nAmong the ideas of pastoral poetry which are here introduced, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-MYTHOLOGY\">mythology</a> is not omitted; but the allusions are both to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> fables; sometimes to the fairies; and sometimes to the naiads and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSES\">muses</a>. The objects also are borrowed partly from the scenes which this country exhibited some centuries ago, and partly from those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCADIA\">Arcadia</a>: the priory,\n\n(A) In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHROPSHIRE\">Shropshire</a>, between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRMINGHAM\">Birmingham</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOURBRIDGE\">Stourbridge</a>.\npriory, and a Gothic seat, still more particularly characterized by an inscription in obsolete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>, belong to the one; the urns, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>'s obelisk, and a rustic temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAN\">Pan</a>, to the other. All these allusions and objects are indeed equally rural: but the images in an English and classical eclogue are not the same; each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> is a distinct imitative character. Either is proper; either will raise the farm it is applied to above the ordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>; and within the compass of the same place both may be introduced; but they should be separate: when they are mixed, they counteract one another; and no representation is produced of the times and the countries they refer to. A certain district should therefore be allotted to each, that all the fields which belong to the respective <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> together, and the corresponding ideas be preserved for a continuance.\n\n2. In such an affortment, the more open and polished scenes will generally be given to the Arcadian shepherd; and those in a lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of cultivation, will be thought more conformable to the manners of the ancient British yeomanry. We do not conceive that the country in their time was entirely cleared, or distinctly divided; the fields were surrounded by woods, not by hedges; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> a considerable tract of improved land lay together, it still was not separated into a number of inclosures. The subjects, therefore, proper to receive this character, are those in which cultivation seems to have encroached on the wild, not to have subdued it; as the bottom of a valley in corn, while the sides are still overgrown with wood; and the outline of that wood indented by the tillage creeping more or less up the hill. But a glade of grass, thus circumfanced, does not peculiarly belong to the species; that may occur in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARK\">park</a> or pastoral farm; in this, the pastures should rather border on a waste or a common; if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, they may be broken by straggling bushes, thickets, or coppices; and the scattered trees should be beset with brambles and briars. All these are circumstances which improve the beauty of the place; yet appear to be only remains of the wild, not intended for embellishment. Such interruptions must, however, be less frequent in the arable parts of the farm; but there the opening may be divided into several lands, distinguishing, as in common fields, only by different sorts of grain. These will sufficiently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the sameness of the space; and the tillage does not furnish a more pleasing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>, than such a space so broken, if the extent be moderate, and the boundary beautiful.\n\nAs much wood is essential to the character, a spot may easily be found, where turrets rising above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVERT\">covert</a>, or some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> seen within it, may have the resemblance of a castle or an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a>. The partial concealment is almost necessary to both; for to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, the buildings must seem to be entire; the ruins of them belong to later days: the dilapidate is, however, advantageous to them as objects; none can be imagined more picturesque, than a tower boomed in trees, or a clutter appearing between the stems and the branches. But the superstitions of the times furnish other objects which are more within compass: hermitages were then real; solitary chapels were common; many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> of the country being deemed holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELLS\">wells</a>, were distinguished by little Gothic domes built over them; and every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMLET\">hamlet</a> had its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>, even this, when perfect, set on a little rustic pillar, and that raised upon a base of circular steps, may in some scenes be considerable: if a situation can be found for a Maypole, whence it would not obtrude itself on every view, that also might not be improper; and an ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, however unwelcome it may be when it breaks into the design of a park or a garden, in such a farm as this would be a fortunate accident: nor would the old yew in the church-yard be indifferent; it would be a memorial of the times when it was useful.\n\nMany other objects, significant of the manners of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, might perhaps, upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a>, occur; but these are amply sufficient for a place of considerable extent; and cottages must abound in every age and every country; they may therefore be introduced in different forms and positions. Large pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> are also particularly proper; and all the varieties of rills are consistent with every species of farm. From the concurrence of so many agreeable circumstances in this, be the force or the effect of the character what it may, a number of pleasing scenes may be exhibited either in a walk or riding, to be contrasted to those which in another part of the place may be formed on Arcadian ideas; or even to be substituted in their stead, if they are omitted.\n\n3. A part may also be free from either of these imitative characters, and laid out in a common simple farm. Some of the greatest beauties of nature are to be found in the fields, and attend an ordinary state of cultivation: wood and water may there be exhibited in several forms and dispositions; we may enlarge or divide the inclosures; and give them such shapes and boundaries as we please; every one may be an agreeable spot; together, they may compose beautiful views; the arable, the pasture, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAD\">mead</a>, may succeed one another; and now and then a little wild may be intermixed without impropriety; every beauty, in short, which is not unfulfilling in an inclosed country, whether it arises from neglect or improvement, is here in its place.\n\nThe buildings, also, which are frequent in such a country, are often beautiful objects; the church and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANOR\">manor</a> are considerable: the farm-yard itself, if an advantageous situation be chosen for it; if the ricks, and the barns, and the out-houses, are ranged with any design to form them into groups, and if they are properly blended with trees; may be made a picturesque <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>. Many of them may be detached from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUP\">group</a>, and dispersed about the grounds: the dove-cote, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAIRY\">dairy</a>, may be separated from the rest; they may be elegant in their forms, and placed wherever they will have the best effect. A common barn, accompanied by a clump, is sometimes pleasing at a distance; a Dutch barn is so when near; and a hay-stack is generally an agreeable circumstance in any position. Each of these may be single; and besides these, all kinds of cottages are proper. Among so many buildings, some may be converted to other purposes than their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> denotes; and, whatever be their exterior, may within be made agreeable retreats, for refreshment, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a>, or shelter.\n\nWith such opportunities of improvements, even to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECORATION\">decoration</a> within itself, and with advantages of prospect into the country about it, a simple farm may undoubtedly be delightful. It will be particularly acceptable.\nFARM\n\nreptable to the owner, if it be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to his park or his garden: the objects which constantly remind him of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, impose a kind of constraint; and he feels himself relieved, by retiring sometimes from the splendor of a seat into the simplicity of a farm: it is more than a variety of scene: it is a temporary change of situation in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, which has all the charms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>, ease, and tranquility, to recommend it. A place, therefore, can hardly be deemed perfect, which is not provided with such a retreat. But if it be the whole of the place, it seems inadequate to the mansion: a visitor is disappointed; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> is dissatisfied; he is not sufficiently distinguished from his tenants; he misses the appendages incidental to his seat and his fortune; and is hurt at the similarity of his grounds with the country about them. A pastoral or an ancient farm is a little above the common level; but even these, if brought close up to the door, set the house in a field, where it always appears to be neglected and naked.\n\nSome degree of polish and ornament is expected in its immediate environs; and a garden, though it be but a small one, should be interposed between the mansion and any species of farm.\n\nOf an ornamented form.\n\n4. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of the propriety of such improvements about a seat, joined to a taste for the more simple delights of the country, probably suggested the idea of an ornamental farm, as the means of bringing every rural circumstance within the verge of a garden. This idea has been partially executed very often; but nowhere, perhaps, so completely, and to such an extent, as at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOBURN\">Woburn</a> farm, (near Weybridge in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURREY\">Surrey</a>.) The place contains 150 acres; of which near 35 are adorned to the highest degree; of the rest, about two thirds are in pasture, and the remainder is in tillage. The decorations are, however, communicated to every part: for they are disposed along the sides of a walk, which, with its appendages, forms a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> belt round the grazing-grounds; and is continued, though on a more contracted scale, through the arable. This walk is properly garden; all within it is farm; the whole lies on the two sides of a hill, and on a flat at the foot of it: the flat is divided into corn-fields; the pastures occupy the hill; they are surrounded by the walk, and crossed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> carried along the brow, which is also richly dressed, and which divides them into two lawns, each completely encompassed with garden.\n\nThese are in themselves delightful; the ground in both lies beautifully: they are diversified with clumps and single trees; and the buildings in the walk seem to belong to them. On the top of the hill is a large octagon structure; and, not far from it, the ruin of a chapel. To one of the lawns the ruin appears, on the brow of a gentle ascent, backed and grouped with wood; from the other is seen the octagon, upon the edge of a steep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, and by the side of a pretty grove, which hangs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the declivity. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAWN\">lawn</a> is further embellished by a neat Gothic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>; the former by the house, and the lodge at the entrance; and in both, other objects of less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, little seats, alcoves, and bridges, continually occur.\n\nThe buildings are not, however, the only ornaments of the walk; it is shut out from the country, for a considerable length of the way, by a thick and lofty hedge-row, which is enriched with woodbine, jessamine, and every odoriferous plant whose tendrils will entwine with the thicket. A path, generally of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> or gravel, is conducted in a waving line, sometimes close under the hedge, sometimes at a little distance from it; and the turf on either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> is diversified with little groups of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>, of firs, or the smallest trees, and often with beds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>: these are rather too profusely treed, and hurt the eye by their littleness; but then they replenish the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> with their perfumes, and every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALE\">gale</a> is full of fragrance. In some parts, however, the decoration is more chaste; and the walk is carried between larger clumps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-EVERGREENS\">evergreens</a>, thickets of deciduous shrubs, or still more considerably open plantations. In one place it is entirely simple, without any appendages, any gravel, or any fence to separate it from the lawn; and is distinguished only by the richness of its verdure, and the nicety of its preservation. In the arable part it is also of greenward, following the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the hedges about the several inclosures: these hedges are sometimes thickened with flowering shrubs; and in every corner or vacant space, is a rosy, a clove or an open clump, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of flowers: but if the parterre has been rilled for the embellishment of the fields, the country has on the other hand been searched for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> new in a garden; and the shrubs and the flowers which used to be deemed peculiar to the one, have been liberally transferred to the other; while their number seems multiplied by their arrangement in so many and such different dispositions. A more moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of them would, however, have been better; and the variety more pleasing, had it been less licentious.\n\nBut the excess is only in the borders of the walk; the scenes through which it leads are truly elegant, everywhere rich, and always agreeable. A peculiar cheerfulness overflows both the lawns, arising from the number and the splendor of the objects with which they abound, the lightness of the buildings, the inequalities of the ground, and the varieties of the plantations. The clumps and the groves, though separately small, are often massed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a>, and gathered into considerable groups, which are beautiful in their forms, their tints, and their positions. The brow of the hill commands two lovely prospects: the one gay and extensive, over a fertile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, watered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a>, and broken by St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>'s Hill and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINDSOR\">Windsor</a> Castle; a large mead, of the most luxuriant verdure, lies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> below the eye, spreading to the banks of the river; and beyond it the country is full of farms, villages, and villages, and every mark of opulence and cultivation. The other view is more wooded: the steeple of a church, or the turrets of a seat, sometimes rise above the trees; and the bold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of Walton <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> is there a conspicuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, equally singular and noble. The inclosures on the flat are more retired and quiet; each is confined within itself; and all together they form an agreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> to the open exposure above them.\n\nWith the beauties which enliven a garden are everywhere intermixed many properties of a farm: both the lawns are pastured; and the lowings of the herds, the bleating of the sheep, and the tinklings of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>-wringer, resound through all the plantations: even the clucking of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a> is not omitted; for a menagerie of a very simple design is placed near the Gothic building;\nFarmer, a small serpentine river is provided for the water-fowl; while the others stray among the flowering shrubs on the banks, or flit about the neighbouring lawn: and the corn fields are the subjects of every rural employment which arable land from seed-time to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> can furnish. But though so many of the circumstances occur, the simplicity of a farm is wanting; that idea is lost in such a profusion of ornament; a rusticity of character cannot be preserved amidst all the elegant decorations which may be lavished on a garden.","sp":15,"ep":19},{"h":"FARMER","t":"in mining, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> of the field, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> one that farms the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPE\">cope</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>.","sp":20,"ep":20},{"h":"FARN ISLANDS","t":"two groups of little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> and rocks, 17 in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, lying opposite to Bamborough castle in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHUMBERLAND\">Northumberland</a>.

STIMULANTS.\n\nThese are such remedies as are suited to increase the action, either of the whole circulating system, or of some particular part or organ. They are at present usually divided into diffusible and permanent, the former being such as produce a considerable stimulating effect, which is soon followed by a degree of quietness or torpor, proportioned to the quantity that had been administered; as wine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALCOHOL\">alcohol</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a>, and probably opium; the other sort being such as produce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> very considerable effect, unless repeatedly exhibited for some considerable time.\n\nMost of the stimulants are called cordials or aromatics; and under this class, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> those medicines which have been called carminatives, or which are calculated to expel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> from the stomach and bowels, epiphanics or blistering substances; and under this class we may also reckon most of those remedies that are called alteratives, or such as are supposed to produce some change in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of body. The stimulating remedies employed in farriery, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> medicine, are very numerous.\n\na. AMMONIA, or Volatile Alkali. Prepared Ammonia. Carbonate of Ammonia.\nDose from half a drachm to two drachms, in a ball newly prepared. In the latter stages of fever, attended with great debility.\n\nb. Spirit of Sal Ammoniac.

Dose about an ounce, in a ball.\n\nd. BALSAM\nd. Balsam of Copaiva. See Expectorants.\n\nIn flatulent colic or gripes.\n\ne. Barbados Tar.\n\nExternally mixed with oil of turpentine or sweet oil into an embrocation. In strains and bruises.\n\nf. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTHARIDES\">Cantharides</a>, or Spanish fly. Lytta vesicatoria.\n\nTincture of cantharides. Externally by way of embrocation in similar cases.\n\nBlisters are well known to be those remedies that irritate the skin to which they are applied, so as to raise the scarf-skin into a bladder containing a watery fluid, which is the serous part of the blood. By abstracting this from the general mass of circulation, they produce an evacuation, proportioned to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, from the part to which they are applied, and are thus extremely useful in producing a determination of blood from some neighbouring and more important part.\n\nBlisters are of considerable use in veterinary practice. According to Mr White they are very efficacious in dispersing callous swellings, the effects of strains, bruises, &c. Their beneficial effects are very great in removing the inflammation of such parts as are remote from the surface. In inflammations of the internal parts of the foot, they generally give relief when applied to the part, especially if the auxiliary remedies are not neglected, such as raising the hoof, paring the sole, soaking the horny part of the foot in warm water, or by the application of a poultice to it, and administering a purging medicine. For curbs, wind-galls, spasms, &c., no remedy is more efficacious than blistering. It is also productive of salutary effects in inflammation of the internal organs. For instance, when the lungs are inflamed, the determination of blood to the diseased part is lessened by extensive blistering of the sides, and considerable relief is afforded in this way.\n\nBy the unskilful treatment of broken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a>, a callous swelling is often left in the part, for the removal of which it is always necessary to have recourse to blistering. If blisters are freed from all caustic ingredients, and properly made, no injury to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> will result from their application; and if one should fail of producing the desired effect, the practice may be followed without danger till that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> is attained.\n\ng. Blue Vitriol. Sulphate of Copper.\n\nEmployed externally to foul ulcers, either in solution, or by touching their edges with a crystal of it; to produce healthy granulations.

Insultation and indigestion.\n\nv. Mercury.\n\nCalomel. Dose, from 15 grains to half a drachm.

Corrosive Sublimate. Muriate of Mercury.\n\nEmployed internally in solution, in doses of about 15 grains, gradually increased. In farcy and glanders. Externally by way of lotion, to foul ulcers and eruptions of the skin.\n\nNo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of mercury seems to produce so great a degree of weakness in the horse as this. Its effects must therefore be carefully watched; and besides the regulations laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> above; the horse must be kept on a more nourishing diet than usual.\n\nx. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> Precipitate.

Antispasmodics.\n\nThere are such remedies as are calculated to remove spasmodic affections of the muscles, or convulsive affections, and are therefore frequently employed in cases of locked jaw, epilepsy, &c. Few remedies of this class are used in veterinary practice. Such as are more peculiarly of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> are mentioned below. They generally consist of stimulants or of anodyne remedies.\n\na. Camphor.\nDose, about two drachms, in a ball combined with opium and stimulants. In locked jaw.\n\nb. Ether. Sulphuric Ether.\nOne of the most powerful antispasmodics.\nDose, about an ounce, mixed with a pint of water.

Anodynes\n\nAre those remedies which are given for the purpose of procuring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, or alleviating pain. They are commonly called narcotics, and many of them are by most medical writers denominated sedatives.\n\na. Fox-Glove. Digitalis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PURPUREA\">purpurea</a>. Lin.\nThe leaves in powder.\nDose, half a drachm, increased gradually according to its effect.

Lin.\nThe dried cones in powder.\n\nDose a drachm or two, in a ball.\n\nThe hop has been shewn to be a powerful narcotic, and has succeeded in producing sleep in some cases where opium has failed. It has not yet been introduced into veterinary practice; but we think it deserves a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, as being much cheaper than opium.\n\ne. Opium.\nDose, about a drachm by the mouth, and two drachms in a clyster.\n\nf. Poppy. Papaver somniferum. Lin.\nThe dried heads boiled in water, by way of fomentation.\n\nReceipts.\n\n53.

Worm Medicines.\n\nThere are few cases in which worm medicines are given in veterinary practice. In the horse they are seldom required, and do not often prove effectual. In the dog, indeed, they have been employed more frequently, and may be used with more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> of success. The remedies of this class are generally of two kinds, either such as are violent purgatives, and in this way expel the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a> by the violence of their operation; or, they are such as act mechanically on these animals, irritating and tearing their tender bodies, and thus forcing them to relinquish their situation.\n\na. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASTOR\">Castor</a> Oil.\nDose, about half a pound.\n\nb. Gamboge.\nDose, two or three drachms in a ball.\n\nc. Mercury. Calomel.\nDose, for a horse, two or three drachms; for a dog, about half a drachm, in a ball with purgatives.\n\nd.

Sal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDUS\">Indus</a>.\nA salt lately procured from the East Indies, said to be successful in expelling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOTS\">bots</a> from horses; but Mr White thinks that other worms have been mistaken for bots, in the cases where it has been successful.\nDose, about four or five ounces in a drench.\n\nf. Tin. Powder of Tin.\nDose, about an ounce, mixed with honey.\nThis promises to be one of the most effectual medicines in cases of tape-worm, that are so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to dogs.\n\nReceipts.\n\n58. Take of calomel, jalap, each half a drachm;\nHoney enough to make a ball.\nFor dogs.\n\n59. Take of tin powder,\nQuicksilver, of each two drachms.\nGrind together till they be thoroughly mixed; then add enough of sugar to form a powder, to be made up into a ball with catile soap, softened with water.\n\n60. Take of sal indus, four ounces;\nAlum, half an ounce;\nWater, a pint.\nDissolve for a drench. For the botts in horses.\n\n16. Chemical Remedies.\n\nMany remedies are given internally, or applied externally, which seem to act merely chemically, either by combining with an acid or alkali, and thus neutralizing it, by checking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>, or correcting the ill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> that is produced by it; or, in external applications, by destroying or corroding the parts to which they are applied. This class will therefore comprehend,\n\n1. All those medicines that have been called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANTACIDS\">antacids</a> or absorbents, which are given to correct acidity in the stomach and bowels.\n\n2. Antalkalines, or those acid substances that are given more rarely to correct alkalinefence.\n\n3. Antiseptics, or those that are supposed capable of obviating putrefaction.\n\n4.

It is very common among these gentlemen to give men to bleed or physic a horse at least twice a-year, viz., in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, though he be in never such good health, or good condition; to give him sulphur and antimony now and then to keep his coat fine; and to administer a cordial ball, or a dose of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAPHORETICS\">diaphoretics</a> occasionally to improve his appetite. If he is to undergo any unusual exertion, as riding or hunting, it is judged necessary by these sagacious practitioners to prepare him for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, by bleeding, purging, and sweating below a load of body clothes in a clole, hot stable. In pursuing this custom, they indeed only imitate what they practice on themselves on similar occasions. As they deem it necessary to have themselves bled every spring and fall, or once a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, to take physic once a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, and to sweat themselves to make them ride or run more lightly in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOCKEY\">jockey</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a>, they naturally conclude that their horses should be treated in the same manner, and should undergo the same preparation.\n\nIf an animal is in a perfect state of health, nothing more is required to render him capable of performing the functions for which he is intended. It is only when there appears some derangement of the system, or when the state of the body is such as to threaten the attack of some dangerous disease, that it is necessary to call in the assistance of medicine. We shall soon have occasion to mention cases of this kind, and to show how the threatened danger is to be avoided. It must be remembered that those substances that are called medicines, are such as produce some effect on the body, that is in general either unnatural, or is greater than what commonly takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in a state of perfect health. If then we give medicines to an animal in this healthy state, we either excite the organs to some unusual exertion, or we check those exertions that are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> and healthy; and in either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, we must do harm. Besides the custom of giving medicines when they are unnecessary, renders them less efficacious when they are absolutely required, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARD\">ward</a> off or obviate any disease. It is found that most remedies, when employed habitually, require to be increased in quantity in order to produce the same effect, and if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> they sometimes cease to produce their effect at all. With respect to some remedies, it is found that their habitual use is attended with dangerous consequences. Frequent bleeding tends to produce fatness, and a plethoric state of the body; the frequent use of cordials and stimulants stimulates the circulation too much, and produces such a rigidity of the fibres, as lays the foundation of apoplexy, palsy, and other dangerous disorders. It is well known, too, that when the action of the stomach is too much excited by the habitual use of stimulants, it in time loses its tone, and becomes incapable of healthy digestion, unless roused by a greater quantity of its accustomed stimulus. It is therefore obvious that when an animal is in perfect health, all that is required to keep him so, is the proper regulation of diet, exercise, cleanliness, and other circumstances that have been mentioned in the fourth part of this article.\n\nWe cannot better illustrate the absurdity of the usual methods\nmethods of preparing horses for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, than by the following case, which fell under the observation of Mr Clark of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>. \"Two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> gentlemen betted their horses to run against each other on the sands of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEITH\">Leith</a> for a considerable sum, and this was to take place three weeks after the bet. The horses were to be ridden by their own grooms. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> R's was a poney about 13\u00bd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, Captain M's was a gelding about 15 hands <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>. Both grooms were bred at Newmarket, and were keen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> for bleeding and purging, though both the horses had been kept on dry food, and in the best order, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of time for such treatment was very short. This bleeding and purging was in order to prepare them the better for running. Captain M's horse was bled once, and purged twice. Captain R's was bled once, and purged once. Both were sweated in the stable with a great load of clothes; and their stables, though separate, were kept uncommonly hot, and closely shut up day and night, though it was in the midst of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>. From this treatment the horses soon lost their appetite, and in the course of eight or ten days their strength was so much exhausted that they were scarcely able to go through their usual exercise on the sands. In this situation Captain R. considered his bet as lost, and expected nothing less than the loss of his poney, on which he felt a high value. Luckily, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROOM\">groom</a>, who was rather corpulent, had put himself under a course of physic, to bring himself down to the proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, and was unable to proceed in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of purging and sweating the horse. The poney was therefore provided with another groom, and was put under the care of Mr Clark, who, feeling the absurdity of the plan which had hitherto been observed, ordered his clothing to be reduced to a single rug, and the stable windows to be thrown open, to admit the fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. The poney soon recovered his appetite; and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>, strength and spirits were in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> restored. Captain M's horse in the meantime was continued under the debilitating regimen. When the race came to be decided, though at starting the odds were considerably in favour of Captain M's horse, yet his opponent won the race with considerable ease.\n\nPART VI. OF THE DISEASES INCIDENT TO <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">DOMESTIC</a> ANIMALS.\n\nIN treating of the diseases of domestic animals; we shall class them in two great divisions: in the first of which we shall consider most of those morbid affections which are usually called local and symptomatic, or in general those simple affections of the several functions, that are most easily understood, and require the least complicated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of treatment. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> of these divisions we shall treat of the more complicated diseases, or those in which the whole system is more or less affected, and of which the treatment is more difficult, and in general more precarious.\n\nWhen an animal is diseased, he is affected with some or other of the following symptoms.\n\n1. Of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">Sensation</a>.\n   He labours under too acute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>; or,\n   He is affected with pain or itching.\n   His sensibility is unusually diminished.\n   His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of smelling is more or less impaired.\n   He hears with difficulty, or not at all.\n   His vision is more or less impaired.\n   He is unusually watchful.\n   His sleep is disturbed; or,\n   He is unusually heavy and drowsy.\n\n2. Of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">Motion</a>.\n   He is either affected with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>, involuntary motions or spasms; or,\n   His moving powers are impaired.\n\n3. Of Digestion.\n   His digestive organs perform their functions too quickly.\n   His digestion is impaired; or,\n   He does not digest at all.\n   He is affected with sickness,\n   with flatulence, or wind in the stomach and bowels.\n\n4. Of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSORPTION\">Absorption</a>.\n   He is unusually fat; or,\n   Unusually lean.\n   He is affected with some watery swelling.\n\n5. Of Circulation.\n   His circulation is too rapid; or,\n   It is too slow; or,\n   It is irregular.\n   He has some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of blood.\n\n6. Of Respiration.\n   His breathing is hurried; or,\n   It is difficult.\n   He is affected with cough;\n   with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SNEEZING\">sneezing</a>,\n   hiccup.\n   His breath is hot; or,\n   It is cold.\n   His skin is unusually hot; or,\n   It is unusually cold.\n\n7. Of Secretion and Excretion.\n   His secretions and excretions are either unusually copious.\n   He stales profusely.\n   He has a purging; or,\n   His skin is unusually moist.\n   The secretions and excretions are morbidly diminished.\n   He stales with difficulty, or not at all.\n   He is coltive.\n   His skin is unusually dry.\n\n8. Of\n8. Of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">Generation</a>.\n\nHis venereal appetite is excessive; or,\nIt is morbidly impaired.\nHe is impotent.\n\nWhen a practitioner comes to examine one of these animals whose health is deranged, he will naturally inquire into all or most of the above particulars, and they will in general apply to all the four animals of which we are treating. There are some other questions which peculiarly relate to horses, and which it more especially becomes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARRIER\">farrier</a> to ask; as, Whether his flanks work. Whether his ears are cold; or are in constant motion.\n\nIn what manner he walks.\nWhether he looks earnestly at his sides.\nWhether his eyes appear drowsy.\nIn what manner he carries his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>.\nWhether he kicks his belly.\nWhether he appears devious to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> down, but afraid to do so.\nWhether he sometimes lies down on one side, and then immediately turns to the other.\nWhether he lies down and flies up again repeatedly.\nWhether he leans upon the manger.\nWhether he stands off from the manger.\nWhether he paws his litter.\nWhether his nose runs.\nWhether or not he passes much wind.\n\nIt will also frequently be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to ascertain the following particulars.\n\nWhether the horse is usually in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> condition.\nHow did the disorder begin?\nHow long has it continued?\nHow long is it since he ate or drank?\nHas he ever had the disorder before?\nIf he has, what was usually given him on these occasions?\nDoes the disorder come on at any particular times?\nHas he been observed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> any worms?\nHow long he has been bought, and what price was paid for him.\nWas he bought of a horse-dealer, or of a private person?\nOf a friend, or at the public market?\n\nHaving ascertained the necessary particulars, it is proper to consider whether the disease is of such a nature as has in general been easily removed; or whether the expense and time of cure will be sufficiently compensated by the value of the horse; for it must be remarked, that in general a horse or other domestic animal is worth no more than the price he would fetch at the public market. Unless, therefore, the animal is a favorite, or has some particular good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> which greatly enhances his value, it may happen that the expense and trouble of cure may amount to more than the animal is worth. In such a case it would be both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and mercy to kill him, unless we wish to attempt his cure for the sake of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>. These observations of course equally apply to cases that are generally deemed incurable.\n\nHaving found that the disease is of such a nature as to give hopes of a speedy or perfect cure, it will next be proper for the practitioner to consider what is the speediest, safest, and cheapest method of treatment. In particular, he ought to consider whether any immediate remedy be necessary, in order to check the violence of the distemper; more especially whether any immediate evacuation is required, as bleeding, purging, blisters, rowels, &c.\n\nHe must also be particular in examining whether the disease be of a contagious or infectious nature, that the affected animals may be kept in a separate place from those which have not been attacked.\n\nAs the general nature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of disease will be considered at large under the medical department of this work, we have only in this article to detail the symptoms as they occur in the domestic animals; to point out the causes and seat of the disease, as far as they have been ascertained by observation and deduction; and to lay down the most approved methods of treatment adapted to these animals. Observations with respect to the theory of diseases would here be out of place, and we shall seldom hazard them, except in some of those specific complaints which appear to attack solely the animals of which we are treating.\n\nIt may not be improper to remark, that diseases, like the objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, have been arranged in two methods. One of these is the natural method, in which they are classified according to their seat or cause. The causes of diseases are the foundation of Dr. Darwin's system. In the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of this part we shall attempt to classify the morbid symptoms according to their seat, or the functions which they attack. The other method of arrangement, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> method, is that in which diseases are arranged according to some obvious and remarkable symptoms. This is best calculated for the purpose of recognizing the disease when seen, and is the method employed by most physicians. The diseases in the second section of this part will be arranged in this way.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">SECT</a>. I.\n\nCHAP. I. Of Morbid Affections of Sensation.\n\nMost animals are occasionally subject to a morbid degree of sensibility, either of the whole nervous system, or of some particular organ. This morbid sensibility is generally called by medical writers, irritability; but this name is improper, as it implies an affection of the muscular parts; whereas the symptom we are now considering is an affection of the nervous system.\n\nSome horses naturally possess a morbid degree of sensibility, which appears by their starting on the sudden approach of any object, by the peculiar tenderness of their skin that makes them wince and tremble under the currycomb, and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> sensibility that they evince at the least touch of the whip or spur. Such horses are in general very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> and spirited; but they require a cautious and prudent rider, who must rather endeavour to soothe and encourage them, than use any harsh or violent means.\n\nThis increased sensibility is not easily removed by art,\nbut generally decreases as the horse grows older. It is best counteracted by living in a large well-aired stable, by being kept on hard coarse food, and by lying with as little litter below him, as is sufficient to prevent him from injuring himself against the pavement of the stable. In dressing him the currycomb should not be too sharp, and should not be employed too freely.\n\nWhen excessive sensibility arises from a delicacy and weakness of habit, strengthening medicines will be of use, and cordials may occasionally be employed.\n\nThere is a symptom nearly allied to this, which sometimes appears. The animal affected gathers himself together, and brings his four legs as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> as possible below him, and creeps as it were all on a heap. This symptom often attends nervous diseases, and fever affections of the bowels. It is generally considered as a sign of great danger, and is not unfrequently the forerunner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a>.\n\nAt the commencement of several acute diseases, especially those of the brain, animals betray an unusual sensibility to the effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>. When this happens, the place where they are kept should be darkened, and they should be as little as possible disturbed with noise.\n\nThere is a peculiar restlessness and anxiety with which animals are sometimes affected. This is not unfrequently their only complaint, or at least we cannot perceive that they are affected with any obvious or well-marked disease, but it is most commonly a symptom attending violent disorders, especially of the inflammatory kind; and generally preceding the fatal termination of dangerous chronic diseases. Animals thus affected are continually moving about, and often lie down; if they are at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, they seek out the most sequestered and gloomy parts of the pasture, and frequently change their place: if they are tied up, they appear to listen to, or observe, every thing that passes round them; they are restlessly attentive to the various objects near them; but although their eyes appear fixed, and wide open, they do not steadfastly regard any object; they are perpetually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> from side to side, and if they feel pain in any part, they often turn their heads mournfully towards it, sometimes groaning or panting. If this state has continued long, the animals become still more restless, are perpetually shifting about, scraping with their feet and pawing the litter; their ears become cold, and their hairs bristle up.\n\nThese latter symptoms are considered as denoting great danger, especially when the animal looks steadfastly at his sides, or stares with his eyes without appearing to take particular notice of any object.\n\nWhen anxiety appears to be the only symptom, without any signs of inflammation or convulsive affection, it is generally a mark of nervous weakness, and requires cordial and strengthening remedies, nourishing diet, and gentle exercise without labour: but if it is a symptom of some violent disease, it can only be removed by the general treatment of that disease; and in this view, will come to be considered hereafter.\n\nAnimals are sometimes affected with dejection or loss of spirit. This is not unfrequently the attendant of fatigue brought on by excessive labour or unusual exertion; and is therefore most commonly seen in horses. It appears by the animal's leaning his head on the manger, standing still in the same place, and appearing to move with pain or difficulty. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a> are stiff, his skin hard and dry, his eyes look sad, he has no appetite for meat; if he lies down, he remains immovable, or if obliged to rise, immediately falls again when left to himself.\n\nIn general, if the fatigue produced be not extremely great, it gradually goes off with rest and quiet, especially if it has been found practicable to employ the means that are presently to be recommended; but if the exertion to which the animal was exposed, has been too great for its strength, the consequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a> may prove highly dangerous, or even fatal. In this state his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> is crude and watery, and, if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> horse, he seems scarcely to have the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> for the purpose of making water; and his excrements are dry and scanty. If taken out in this condition he moves with pain and difficulty, trots slowly, or lifts his feet very little above the ground, carries his head very low and his ears depressed over his forehead; he often flinches, and not unfrequently falls on his knees, and appears very little sensible of the whip or spur. If a horse in this state has any sores or ulcers about him, they become hard, or flabby, assume a dull appearance, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> proceeding from them becomes thick and viscid. Rowels very frequently dry up; and if he is affected with any eruption of the skin, this commonly disappears.\n\nTo prevent the bad consequences that are likely to follow the state which we have now described, it is proper, as soon as we find a horse much fatigued, to spread a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of litter for him to rest on; and as soon as possible give him a cordial bath, or drench. The strength of this must not, however, be in proportion to the degree of fatigue or depression; as experience has shown, that when a powerful cordial is given in a state of excessive weakness, it proves too much for the animal, and frequently excites fevers or inflammation. The horse's limbs should be bathed with warm water, and then rubbed thoroughly dry. After this he should be left to his repose, and if it be not too late at night, he may in a few hours have a warm bran mash. When a little recovered, he must be gently rubbed all over, but especially his limbs, without currying; he should be put upon a nourishing diet, and exercised but little. These means, varied according to circumstances, will in general bring the horse round, unless the symptoms are extremely violent; when they will commonly terminate in fever, or in some chronic disease, especially <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DROPSY\">dropsy</a>.\n\nThe train of symptoms which we have been describing, are most commonly the effect of fatigue; but they may arise from other causes. They are more or less the attendants of decay, and they are generally the forerunners of fever or inflammation of the brain.\n\nSometimes these animals are affected with a great degree of infirmity or torpor; they are heavy and listless; lie much; are not easily disturbed; are inattentive to the objects around them; seem to be insensible to pain, and move heavily and unwillingly. These symptoms require particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, as in most cases they denote some dangerous affection of the brain, and are very commonly followed by apoplexy or staggers; or by epilepsy; or they are the attendants (especially in sheep) of water in the head. Wherever they are observed to take place in an animal that has been full fed, with little exercise, especially if he appear fat and full\nDiseases of blood, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> be found full and strong, the eyes red or heavy, there is danger of apoplexy; and the animal should immediately be bled and purged, be gradually put on a lower diet, and use gradually more exercise. These changes must be made by degrees, because too sudden changes may produce the very effects against which we are guarding.\n\nA great degree of torpor and insensibility is often produced by excessive cold, or by being kept long in an impure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. Where they have taken place from either of these causes to a dangerous degree, the application of heat must not be too sudden, as it will tend to extinguish the small remaining spark of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, and produce apoplexy, or mortification, where any external part has suffered from cold.\n\nThe head may be affected with dizzinesses, or giddinesses, commonly called turn-flick, from various causes. It may arise from great weakness, or it may be the consequence of plethoria, or fullness of blood. In the latter case, it is a pretty sure mark of approaching apoplexy or staggers; and the animal must immediately be bled, and put on a lower diet, with gentle exercise. In sheep, dizzinesses is a common symptom of flurdy, or water in the head, a complaint which will be considered hereafter. It will be evident that when this affection appears in animals that are lean, meagre, and in low condition, it shows the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of a more full and nourishing diet.\n\nThe only morbid affection of the external senses, that we shall here consider is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLINDNESS\">blindness</a>, a defect which is of most consequence in the horse, though it may occur in all the domestic animals.\n\nThe eyes of a horse, when perfectly sound, have the cornea or outer covering, and the humours that are seen through it, perfectly clear and transparent; there should be no specks, or dragons as they are called, in either; no greenness or glazy appearance of the pupil, and this should readily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> when suddenly exposed to a clear light. Buffon observes, that in a sound eye, two or three foot-coloured spots appear through the cornea above the pupil.\n\nWhen a horse has a defect in his vision, without being perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a>, he appears dull, fearful, and retive, starts at suddenly approaching any object, carries his head high, or to one side; moves his ears alternately, or turns one forwards, while the other is turned backwards; and usually hangs back on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDLE\">bridle</a> or halter, and lifts his legs up very high.\n\nPartial blindness is a symptom of several diseases in the horse: it usually attends great weakness, especially when this has been brought on by hard work and low feeding; it is a common attendant on locked jaw, and generally precedes the staggers. It of course is one of the effects of old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>.\n\nWhen proceeding from debility, it generally goes off in proportion as the strength is restored by rest and proper nourishment; when it is a symptom of other diseases, it goes off when they are removed. The blindness of old age is incurable, and in the horse we believe no method has yet been discovered of relieving the defect by art.\n\nIt is generally allowed, that it is better to have a horse totally, than partially blind; as when quite blind, he is not liable to start, or be shy; and when sure footed, well fed, and managed by a careful rider, there is little danger of his stumbling or falling.\n\nTotal blindness either proceeds from a defect in the optic nerve, by which this is rendered incapable of receiving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of light, or from an opacity or muddiness in the cornea or humours, by which the transmission of light through them is obstructed.\n\nThe first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of blindness, or that depending on a glazy eye, defect in the optic nerve, is generally called by farriers glazy eyes, and by medical writers, it is termed amaurosis, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUTTA\">gutta</a> serena.\n\nIt is known by the peculiar glazy appearance of the eye, which seems perfectly clear, so that an ordinary observer would not suppose that there was any defect in the horse's eye. On examining the eye however more attentively, it will be found that the pupil is considerably dilated, and preserves the same size in every change of light; not contracting, as usual, when the light to which it is exposed becomes stronger. There is also a greenish appearance of the eye in this disease.\n\nThe causes of glazy eyes are not well ascertained. It has followed a blow on the head, or inflammatory affections of the brain or its membranes, but it has come on sometimes imperceptibly, and where these diseases, or any other evident cause has not appeared.\n\nThis disease in the horse has hitherto proved incurable.\n\nThe most common cause of blindness in the horse, is an opacity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENS\">lens</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLINE\">crystalline</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> of the cataract eye. This disease is known by the name of cataract, and is sometimes called by farriers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> blindness, or a horse that has a cataract is said to be moon-eyed.\n\nIt is in general easily discovered that a horse labours under a cataract, as, when the disease is confirmed, an obscenity or muddiness may be seen in the centre of the pupil, occupying more or less of the opening, according as the cataract is more or less extended. The opaque spot is generally of a dull white or yellowish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. Sometimes the crystalline humour is so fixed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRIS\">iris</a>, or that moveable coloured part in the middle of the eye, as to obstruct its motion, and then the pupil retains the same size in every light; or if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADHESION\">adhesion</a> is partial, the pupil of the eye assumes an irregular shape.\n\nIt must be observed, that in this disease, the iris is not always so immovable as in glazy eyes; though when the cataract is fully formed, the pupil is generally enlarged, and contracts very little on the approach of a strong light. Sometimes the lens comes through the pupil altogether, and floats in the watery humour, in the fore part of the eye.\n\nThe cataract in horses is said to be always a consequence of inflammation in the eye, which will be considered in the second section of this part.\n\nThe only method that appears likely to remove the cataract, is an operation by which the opaque lens may be thrust down below the pupil, or entirely extracted from the eye; but neither couching nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a> can be recommended in the horse, as the removal of the lens would still be attended with a defect of vision that would render the animal of less use, than if he were totally blind.\n\nAnother cause of blindness, and also a consequence of inflammation, is opacity of the cornea. There may be either a diffuse whiteness or muddiness in the cornea, that is more or less extensive; or, there may be specks that\nor warts growing on the outside of this coat, so as to obstruct the passage of the rays of light. Sometimes the opacity of the cornea is only slight, producing partial blindness; but frequently it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>, and then the horse cannot see at all. This universal opacity of the cornea is sometimes, though improperly, called cataract. It sometimes disappears for a time, and the eye seems nearly as clear as ever; but it generally returns in no long time.\n\nGeneral opacity diffused through the substance of the cornea, does not readily yield to remedies. Attempts have been made, by clarifying the vessels on the white of the eye, or by stimulating applications to the cornea, to rouse into action the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> vessels of the eye, and thus remove the opacity; but these attempts seem to have been attended with little success. Specks or warts on the cornea, if they are not too large, may generally be removed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, or by repeatedly blowing into the eye a powder composed of powdered glass and white vitriol. But, if these specks are attended with any general opacity of the cornea, little benefit is to be expected from these operations.\n\nAs the skin is so intimately connected with sensation, we shall here consider some of the more simple affections of that organ, that are not generally attended with fever. It is not uncommon for excrescences or warts to grow on the skins of domestic animals, particularly on horses and oxen. Sometimes they are hard and firm; at others they are soft and sprouting; in some their root is smaller than their head; in others the base is the largest part. The sprouting kind of warts are called by the farriers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>-berries, ambury or ambury, and are not uncommon among oxen. As these are largest at the base, they can, like all of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, be removed only by touching them daily with some caustic, as lunar caustic, or butter of antimony. Where the wart has a small root, it may be best removed by tying a strong waxed thread round the root, tightening it now and then as it gets loose till the wart drops off. It is in general not proper to remove warts by the knife, unless they are of such a firm consistence as not to bleed on being cut, and to admit of the application of caustic after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a>.\n\nThere sometimes appears on the skin of the horse, a scurfy eruption at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> of the knee, or the bending of the hock. The eruption generally appears in both places at once, and is called by farriers, the Mallenders and Sullenders; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> which they have borrowed from the French. When considered separately, the eruption of the knee is called the mallenders, and that of the hock the sullenders.\n\nThese eruptions may generally be traced to want of cleanliness, and are, in most cases, easily removed, by washing the parts with soap and water, and applying an ointment, composed of mercurial ointment and camphor; or either of the ointments marked No. 41. and No. 70. in the receipts.\n\nWhen a horse's skin is hard, dry, and unusually tight about the body, the animal is said to be hide-bound. This tightness about the skin is usually the effect of hard work and improper food; and commonly attends lingering diseases, in which the fat is gradually wasted or absorbed. It must therefore be considered rather as a symptom of disease than as a disease itself: but, as is the case with most remarkable symptoms, it has often been regarded as a primary disease; to remove which, by sweating and relaxing remedies, is the principal object of the practitioner.\n\nThe proper remedies for this affection, when it is not a symptom of some lingering disorder, are nourishing diet, with plenty of green food, particular attention to cleanliness, by frequent dressing, and the occasional use of boiled barley and warm mash.\n\nHorses that have a lean, unthrifty-like appearance, suffer with their coats <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> rough and ratty, are said by the grooms to labour under a surfeit. Whence has arisen the application of this strange term to an appearance that seems so opposite to what is generally understood by a surfeit, we are not aware; but an affection of the skin, under the name of surfeit, is thus described by Mr Lawrence: \"Its confirmed state is attended with eruptions, and sometimes with swellings of the legs and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>, and in the latter case is usually to be looked upon, as the termination of some chronic disease, or a consequence of the improper use of mercurial physic. Surfeits are styled dry or wet; in the former, the skin is covered with a thick dry scurf, with scabs, and small hard tumours like warbles; in the latter, a sharp briny ichor issues from the poll, neck, withers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, and hinder legs, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> of the hock, causing great stiffness and inflammation; this is probably analogous with scurvy in the human body, and will often attend <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CART\">cart</a>-horses, with foul and unwholesome blood, at stated periods. The too free use of beans will produce the wet surfeit.\"\n\n\"The cure of surfeits depends almost entirely upon internal alternatives, with a very small attention to external applications. As to the latter, perhaps, frequent cleansing, with a good strong lather of soap is generally sufficient, but where the eruptions are hard and fixed, and the scabs do not peel off, I know of nothing better than to rub them frequently with the strong mercurial unction, keeping the horse well clothed, and giving warm water in the interim. The warm bath if the animal is strong.\"\n\nOne of the most common diseases of the skin among mange in domestic animals, is what is commonly called the mange horses, in horses, cattle and dogs, and the scab or itch in sheep. Its symptoms differ but little in the different species of animals, and we do not remember to have seen the disorder well described by any writer. The following description of the mange in horses by Mr Feron, is perhaps among the best that have been published. \"The mange is a contagious chronical disorder which manifests itself in the skin, on which sensible eminences of a roundish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> rise up; these being scratched, a fluid oozes out, of a hot and corroding quality, that excoriates the found skin wherever it runs, in a little time forming a dry, scaly, crusty eruption, which in its progress spreads over the whole surface of the body; and the skin becomes unequally thick, thin, hard, and loathsome. If the disorder has been neglected, or ill-treated, the animal falls off from his food, grows lean, and the legs fweel; in this state the patient has frequent fits of shivering and trembling, and a slight fever arises, terminating in farcy or the glanders, by which he is easily destroyed.\"\n\nA disease similar to this, if not of the same kind, affects cattle, especially such as are ill fed, and not kept clean. It is commonly called by herdsmen, the scab or\nDiseases, or scurf; and is thus described in a popular treatise on cow-doctoring.\n\nSkin stiff, and fits fast to every part of the carcass, as if too small for the body. It makes its first appearance about the head and jaws of the animal, with a scurfy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a>, and dry texture; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a> begins to scratch against everything that comes in its way: it then shows itself along the back, and behind the shoulders; and if timely aid be not procured, the animal will tear its skin till it bleeds violently, which ought to be prevented, if possible, as the scabs which are the consequence of bleeding, much retard the efficacy of the ointment, and the loss of time confirms the disorder.\n\nThis disease is incident to sheep in some particular pastures, situations, and flocks, more than to others. The predisposing cause seems to be a relaxed habit of body, produced by poverty or lameness, though some sheep are subject to it that are fat, and otherwise in good condition. The disease seldom seems to originate with such sheep, but to be conveyed to them by infection.\n\nDogs are exceedingly subject to the mange, and readily catch it from each other. The appearance of the disease in dogs, is familiar to everyone, as there are few more common and disgusting sights than a mangy dog. A dog in this state is very unfit for any active exertion, as the affection of the skin renders him stiff and sore even in his limbs. A friend of ours had a greyhound, that, when he was clean, was one of the swiftest runners in the country, and had gained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> in many a coursing match. This dog caught the mange, and while in this situation was several times, sent in pursuit of a hare; but now, puts generally escaped him.\n\nThis disease has sometimes been attributed to animals, such as are found in the symptoms of the itch upon the human skin; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> seems to be in favour of this idea. It is, however, evidently connected with poor living, and want of cleanliness.\n\nIn the treatment of the mange, we are to rely chiefly on the use of external applications, such as ointments, composed of sulphur, of some preparation of mercury, or hellebore roots. The receipts marked No. 68 and 69 are well adapted to the cure of this disease. Sometimes internal remedies, such as sulphur and gentle laxatives, are required; and the greatest attention must be paid to cleanliness, diet, and exercise. It may be necessary in some cases, especially where the animals that have caught the disease, are very full of blood, to bleed and give cooling phthisic previous to the application of ointment; and in all cases the skin should be thoroughly washed with soap and water, both before and after anointing. The animals should always be confined till they are quite free from the disease.\n\nMr Feron, who considers the mange in horses as a general affection of the system, and not merely a local disease of the skin, strongly recommends the use of blisters, which he has seen act as a specific. \"The local treatment, and the only one to be depended upon (says this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>), consists in a judicious application of blisters, used after the following manner; viz. if the whole body is affected, the one half must be blistered one day, and the other in three days after. This must be done at different times, in order to prevent the cantharides from operating too violently upon the kidneys and bladder; but if this happens, let the animal be bled, and clysters frequently injected. But the best way to avoid this, is to leave off all kinds of internal medicines, during the action of the blisters. When they begin to operate, the skin must be fomented with warm water three times a-day, in order to wash out a quantity of yellow matter, discharged by the action of the blisters, and to encourage the growth of new hair.\" We do not pretend to dispute the efficacy of Mr Feron's blistering practice in removing the mange, but we doubt whether the blistering one half of the body with cantharides may not be productive of more serious consequences than the disease which it is intended to remove. At any rate, the expense of the method, and the torment which it must occasion to the poor animal, must greatly prevent the general application of the remedy.\n\nIn Mr Findlater's survey, quoted above, are the following judicious observations on the treatment of sheep labouring under the scab.\n\n\" Sheep that are regularly tarred, or smeared, are seldom infected with this disease. If the disease be partial, perhaps the best remedy would be to clip the affected parts as bare as possible, and rub them occasionally with the common smearing ointment, to which may be added a little Venice turpentine. They should also be washed, once or twice a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> soap and water. But if this prove ineffectual, or if the disease has gone to a great extremity, the animal should first be washed as clean as possible, in a pond, or rill of water, to purge away all the accumulated virus, or infecting matter, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>. A little black soap may be of great use in washing. Then the whole body may be smeared with juice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>; and after the animal becomes dry, may be rubbed with butter mixed with powdered brimstone; or brimstone mixed with the smearing ointment would answer better. A little of the sulphur may meanwhile be thrown down its throat. If this treatment, being twice or thrice repeated, after an interval of several days, should prove ineffectual, recourse must be had to the mercurial ointment, composed of three ounces of hogs lard, well rubbed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a>, with half a drachm of finely powdered corrosive sublimate; or the same proportion of corrosive sublimate, well mixed with three ounces of the common smearing ointment, will answer equally well. The animal being smeared with this ointment, will soon be effectually cured. Meanwhile the diseased animal should be invigorated or put upon substantial food.\"\n\nIn a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> Mr Findlater mentions an observation of Mr Loch's of Rachan, that the matter discharged in the scab mixing with the wool, and drying, forms a hard impenetrable crust, which he has observed of half an inch in thickness; that it is vain to think of curing it by any external application, till this is removed; and that you might as well attempt to cure a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of the itch, by rubbing butter and brimstone upon his coat, instead of his naked skin; that the scurf thus formed, must be removed by soaking and washing it with warm lime-water and soap, and scraping it clean to the quick with a blunt knife. It may then be successfully cured by the ointment; or, what is more cleanly and more easily prepared, by means of a lotion made by dissolving half a drachm of corrosive sublimate in a quart (chopin) bottle of whisky and water. Mr Loch has always\nDiseases always found this lotion effectual, after two or three applications.\n\nIt has been proposed by a correspondent of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">Farmer</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>, to inoculate sheep for the scab, in order to render it milder. Even should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INOCULATION\">inoculation</a> have this effect, which is by no means certain, it does not appear necessary, in a disease that is so easily cured.\n\nBesides the several applications that we have mentioned, a variety of ointments and lotions are recommended by writers on dogs. Mr Beckford advises that as soon as a mange spot appears on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HOUND\">hound</a>, it should be well rubbed with a liniment composed of a pint (mutton) of train oil, half a pint of oil of turpentine, a quarter of a pound of powdered ginger, and half an ounce of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>. It is also recommended that the dog should have a purging ball now and then, and should be kept from fleas meat. There is a variety of the mange in dogs, called the red mange, which it is said is best cured by mercurial ointments.\n\nMost of the domestic animals, especially when young, are troubled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol0.html#article-LICE\">lice</a>. Calves are sometimes louly, if they have been hard kept during winter, by being turned out in severe weather, fed on poor diet, and not kept clean. The best means of destroying these vermin is by rubbing their hide with an ointment composed of slaves-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>, or cayenne pepper, mixed up with hogs lard.\n\nYoung whelps are very subject to lice; but they may be easily removed by washing with a lotion formed by steeping a pound of tobacco in three English pints of small beer, or by rubbing the skin well with train-oil.\n\nFleas are best destroyed by washing the dogs frequently with soft soap and water.\n\nSheep are often infected with vermin of various kinds, which harass the animals exceedingly; and not only do much mischief to the wool, but even eat into the animal's skin.\n\nThe sheep fly abounds most in the southern parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, and is chiefly troublesome to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMBS\">lambs</a>. The most effectual means of protecting the lambs from the insect appears to be to smear the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEECE\">fleece</a> with any kind of rancid oil.\n\nAnother species of insects that infect sheep is commonly called tick, or kedd, the hippobosca ovina of naturalists.\n\nThe smearing ointment generally prevents, or kills this insect. But if this should not happen, or if the sheep are not smeared, insects of every kind may be effectually killed, by slightly rubbing the parts affected with mercurial ointment, composed of three ounces of hogs lard, rubbed up with half a drachm of finely powdered corrosive sublimate. To this may be added, a little of the spirit of turpentine. Coal-oil is powerfully destructive to insects of every kind; but whether it may not prove injurious to the health or fleece of the sheep, has not yet been ascertained by experiment. A decoction or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALL\">gall</a>-plant, which abounds in many moors and muirs, is known to be very fatal to insects of every kind; and a sheep may be safely washed with this juice. The juice of tobacco is also much recommended as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> for those insects which infect sheep.\n\nThe last species of insects are chiefly hurtful to sheep among the insects which prove most troublesome to horses, sheep, and cattle, are those of the genus Oe. trus, some species of which are generally known by the name of gad-fly. The best account of these insects and their effects, that we have seen, is that of Mr Bracey Clark, published in the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Linnaean Transactions, from which the following account is chiefly taken.\n\nMr Clark describes five species of Oe. trus, viz. Oe. bovis, Oe. equi, Oe. haemorrhoidalis, Oe. veterinus, and Oe. ovis.\n\nWe shall at present describe the effects only of the first and last species.\n\nThe Oe. bovis, as its name imports, chiefly attacks Gail-fly, or cattle, through the skins of which it pierces, in order to deposit its eggs. The pain which it inflicts in doing so, appears to be much more severe than what is excited by any of the other species. When one of the cattle is attacked by this fly, it is easily known by the extreme terror and agitation that seizes the whole herd. The unfortunate object of attack runs bellowing from among his fellows, to some distant part of the pasture, or to the nearest water, holding his tail, from the severity of the pain, extended straight from the body, in a line with his back, with a tremulous motion, and stretching out his head and neck to the utmost. The rest of the herd, infected with the like fear, though not attacked, fly also to the water, or disappear to different parts of the pasture.\n\n\"Such is the dread and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> in the cattle, for this fly, says Mr Clark, that I have seen one of them meet the herd when almost driven home, and turn them back, regardless of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, sticks, and noise of their drivers; nor could they be flopped till they reached their accustomed retreat in the water.\"\n\nWhen one of these flies happens to attack oxen that are yoked in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>, there is often considerable danger, as the animals become quite ungovernable, and will often rush directly forwards with the plough, through hedges, or whatever opposes their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>.\n\nHorses, steers, and the younger cattle, are in general most frequently attacked by this fly; the strongest and most healthy beasts seem constantly to be preferred by it, and this circumstance is said to be a criterion of goodflesh held in much esteem by the dealers in cattle. Tanners also have remarked, that their best and strongest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIDES\">hides</a> have generally the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of holes in them.\n\nThe larvae of this species, as of most of those we are to mention, are generally termed bots, but this name is most frequently applied to the larvae of the Oe. equi.\n\nThe complaint produced by the puncture of this insect in the skins of cattle, is called puckeridge, and is not unfrequently attributed to the bite of the goat-fucker. For the destruction of the larvae thus deposited, it has been recommended to insert a red-hot wire into each of the holes made in the skin; but this is a formidable remedy, and will probably do as much harm to the skin as the bots themselves. A more rational practice that is sometimes in use, is to press the parts, and rub them well with a little oil of turpentine, or some other stimulating application, or a little oil of turpentine may be injected into each hole.\nThe larvae of the *Oe. bovis* are commonly known to the country people by the names of *worms*, or *worms*, or *woolworms*. During the summer, sheep are often observed to gather together in clutters, endeavouring carefully to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> their heads. Mr Blaine says that this is to protect themselves against the attacks of this insect, which attempts to lay its eggs on the inner margin of the nose, which when it has effected, these eggs become larvae, and creep up into the frontal and maxillary sinuses.\n\nIt is not easy to discover the manner in which this insect deposits its eggs, owing to its obscure colour and rapid motions, and to the great agitation into which the sheep are thrown by its attack; but the subsequent motion of the sheep, and the manner in which they attempt to defend themselves against their enemy, leave no room to doubt, that the eggs are deposited on the inner margin of the nostrils.\n\nThe moment the fly touches this part of the sheep, they shake their heads, and strike the ground violently with their fore feet, at the same time holding their noses close to the earth; they run away, looking about them on every side, to see whether the fly pursues; they also smell to the grass, as they go, lest one should be lying in wait for them. As they cannot, like horses, take refuge in the water, they have recourse to a rut, or dry dusty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, or gravel-pits, where they crowd together during the heat of the day, with their noses held close to the ground, which renders it difficult for the fly conveniently to get at the nostril.\n\nObservations on these flies are best made in warm weather, and during the heat of the day, when by driving the sheep from their retreats to the grass, the attack of the fly, and the emotions of the sheep, are easily observed.\n\nThe nostril from repeated attacks, and the consequent rubbing against the ground, becomes highly inflamed and sore, which occasions their touch to be so much dreaded by the sheep.\n\nIt is said that this fly also deposits its eggs in the skin of the sheep, but we are not certain how far this has been proved by experience; although there is no doubt that there are sometimes found in the sheep's skin, maggots that must have been produced from eggs deposited by some insect. They prove extremely troublesome to the animal, eating into the skin, and producing ulcers. If not discovered in time they may even destroy the life of the sheep. The remedy is to clip the infected parts bare, wash them well with black soap and water, and apply the smearing ointment. If this does not succeed, recourse must be had to the method recommended, in No. 337.\n\nWhen sheep have lain about for a long time in wet and marshy pastures, or have been kept in woods or copses in a starving condition, their fleeces become so completely soaked with water, that the wool rots off from the skin. This is what is called the *pelt-rot*. If sheep be suffered to continue long in this condition, they become heavy and low-spirited, and will sooner or later be destroyed. If, however, they be attended to in proper time, they may be saved by driving them to a good straw-yard, pulling off their ragged and rotten wool, and rubbing on a good coat of tar, grease, and turpentine. Care must also be taken, to provide them with plenty of good wholesome nourishment.\n\nThe skin of all animals, especially on the most delicate parts of it, is subject to excoriation or chafing. This is of most consequence in the backs of horses fretted with the saddle, and the udders of cows by rubbing against their thighs, when they are cat-hammed, &c., and go close behind. Both the udder and thighs of the cow are sometimes quite raw, and ulcerated. The best remedy in these cases, is to wash the parts well with warm soap and water, and afterwards bathe them frequently with a mixture of Goulard, and camphorated spirits.\n\nThe teats of cows are sometimes chapped, which is commonly owing to want of cleanliness in the milkers. When this happens, the treatment recommended above for chapping may be followed, or if this does not succeed, the teats may be anointed with what is called unguentum nutritum. If the teats are very painful, the cracks may first be bathed with a little laudanum, and afterwards filled up with finely powdered prepared chalk.\n\nThere are many other diseases that affect the skin of these animals; but some of them are so trifling as not to require particular notice, and others being intimately connected with some general derangement of the system, fall more properly to be considered in the next section of this part.\n\n**Chap. II. Morbid Affections of Motion.**\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of motion may be morbidly affected in various ways, but all these tend more or less to impede or disturb the natural motions of the animal.\n\nThe muscles are often affected with irregular motions, producing violent involuntary contractions, called convulsions or spasms. These are often symptoms of some dangerous derangement of the brain or nervous system, as locked-jaw, epilepsy, canine madness, &c. Convulsions of this nature, being intimately dependent on the primary disease, can only be removed by such means, as are calculated to carry off the disease, of which they are the symptoms. Irregular action of the muscles commonly attends great debility, whether it be brought on by hard work and low diet, or by disease. In either case, it is commonly a very dangerous symptom. We cannot properly consider the treatment of convulsion here; but it will be considered in the next section, when we come to treat of convulsive or spasmodic diseases.\n\nThe affection that we are chiefly called to consider of lameness in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> is lameness, a very comprehensive term, as it includes almost all the local affections of the extremities. Lameness is a complaint that is exceedingly common among horses and dogs, especially the former; in whom it more particularly demands attention, as it so materially affects the value of the animal. A knowledge of the nature of lameness, and the method of treating it, can only be acquired by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of the causes by which it is produced.\n\nThe causes of lameness are extremely numerous and various. We shall endeavour to classify them, so as to render our inquiry as little tedious and difficult as may be.\n\n1. Lameness may be produced by a stiffness of some stiff parts of the muscles, tendons, or ligaments, arising either from excessive labour, from bruises, wounds, or some diseased affection of the joints.\nIt is well known, that when the muscles of an animal are exerted for any unusual length of time, or in a more than ordinary degree, they become fatigued, and cannot for some time perform their functions with their accustomed ease. In general, after proper rest and careful treatment, the stiffness gradually goes off; and in a day or two the animal is able to exert himself as usual; but if care has not been taken to rub him well down, and provide him with a well littered bed, and especially if he has been exposed to cold while sweating and fatigued, this stiffness may continue for many days, or may even degenerate into permanent lameness. Animals that have acquired this permanent stiffness of their limbs, always move with considerable difficulty, when first taken out; but in general when they have been long in exercise, and are become warm, the stiffnesses and lameness in a great measure disappear, but they commonly return again when the exertion is over.\n\nWhere the stiffness has not continued long, it may in general be easily removed, by frequent friction of the limbs, first with a wisp of hay and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>, and afterwards with some warm liniment or embrocation, such as has been described among the stimulant receipts.\n\nIf it does not yield to this treatment, recourse may be had to warm fomentations, and gentle exercise must be persisted in. If the lameness should still continue, it will probably be occasioned by a strain of some ligament, or an injury done to some part of the limb.\n\nAny of the muscular parts may be bruised by falls or blows; and if the bruise takes place on the limbs, or in their neighbourhood, lameness may be the consequence. A bruise is almost always followed by a swelling of the bruised part, occasioned by the rupture of small vessels, that pour out their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> into the cellular membrane. If the bruise is slight, the swelling will soon subside; but if the injury has been considerable, and much blood has been poured out, inflammation and consequent suppuration will take place, and the part will become an abscess. If the injury has been still greater, and the texture of the parts has been destroyed, mortification will probably come on, and if the bruise be extensive, will be attended with considerable danger.\n\nThe treatment of bruises will be different according to the degree of the injury produced. In slight cases the object will be to promote the absorption of the effused blood; and this will be best answered by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a> the part with warm vinegar and water, or camphorated spirit. If there is considerable inflammation, and it is not judged proper to encourage a suppuration, the parts must be frequently bathed with a solution of sugar of lead, with a little vinegar; or, where the part admits of a bandage, it will be better to form a cold poultice of oatmeal mixed up with such a solution, and kept constantly applied to the part and frequently moistened with the solution to prevent its becoming hard and dry. If a suppuration should appear unavoidable, it will be proper to encourage it by a frequent application of warm poultices renewed as often as they become cool, or, where these cannot be applied, by repeatedly fomenting the part with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a> wrung out of warm water. When the suppuration is complete, the swelling must be opened with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANCET\">lancet</a>, or by means of a feton; and the sore must be treated as we shall presently describe with respect to ulcers. If mortification takes place, the parts must be frequently fomented with the fomentation directed in No. 57, of the receipts; and the animal's strength must be supported by nourishing food, and the occasional use of cordial and strengthening remedies. If the mortified part be very extensive, it may be necessary to make incisions towards the edges with a knife, to promote the separation of the flough; or firing may be employed, as directed for this purpose in No. 175.\n\nIt sometimes happens that after the inflammation which attended a bruise has subsided, a permanent hard tumour is left, that prevents the free motion of the muscles of the part. This may arise either from a thickening of some ligament, or the cellular texture, or it may proceed from an excrescence formed on the bone, in consequence of the bruise. The treatment in such cases will be presently described, when we come to consider splints, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>, and other tumours that commonly produce lameness.\n\nHorses are very liable to receive severe bruises in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TREAD\">Tread</a>, or back part of the foot, either from the tread of another overreaching horse, as often happens in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, by a horse in the rear-rank treading on the heels of one in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a>-rank; or, by a horse overreaching his hind foot, and thus bruising the heels of the fore foot. From the manner in which this accident is produced, it has received the names of tread, and overreach. Sometimes the bruise is so slight as to be productive of no farther ill consequence than a temporary lameness; but if the tread has been very violent, the edges of the part trodden on may be so much bruised as to produce considerable inflammations, or even a mortification. In ordinary cases it is sufficient to wash the part carefully with warm water, to clear it of dirt and gravel, then apply a pledget dipped in spirits, and bind up the foot, so as to exclude the external air; when the bruise, if slight, will probably soon heal. But in some cases matter is formed, which makes its way downwards towards the sole, forming what is called a quitter. Quitters may also take place from a puncture in the foot, by a nail or other pointed body, the effects and treatment of which will be presently described.\n\nIn a newly-formed quitter, it is of consequence to ascertain, whether it has been produced by a prick or a tread. In the former case the matter usually makes its way upwards from the punctured part towards the coronet; and here the practice generally followed by farriers is, to fear the upper orifice with a hot iron, which answers no other purpose than to confine the matter within the wound, where it must produce extensive ulceration and destruction of important parts of the foot. In the latter case, where quitter is produced by a tread, and where the tissue formed is very superficial, the use of the cautery may be very proper; and if it can be so applied as to inflame the whole extent of the wound, it may entirely carry off the disease. According to Mr. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLANE\">Blane</a>, there are too general methods of curing quitter; one by removing a part of the hoof, cutting away the diseased parts, or suffering them to flough off or exfoliate. The other, to apply caustic to the diseased surfaces, introducing it within the confines, thus destroying the ulcerated parts, and allowing the healthy parts to throw them off. The latter is called by farriers coreing out a quitter, as they suppose that\nthe core or flough that comes away formed a part of the complaint. Mr Blaine objects to removing the hoof, as it would take up a considerable time before new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">horn</a> can be formed; and it is probable that in the new hoof there will be a false quarter, which will render the horse unfound, besides that, during the formation of the new hoof, fresh sinuses may be produced.\n\nIn the method of cure by caustic, he thinks that the disease may be completely removed in three or four weeks, whereas the other method may require as many months. The mode of applying the caustic is, to examine carefully the extent and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the sinuses, and then to fill them up with powdered blue vitriol, verdigrise, or corrosive sublimate. Mr Blaine has found that a paste made of corrosive sublimate, mixed up with flour and butter, forms a very good caustic for this purpose. Some of it is to be introduced by means of a probe, to which a piece of sponge is fastened, which must be carefully introduced in every direction, so as to touch all the diseased parts, after which the whole foot is to be bound up; but the bandage must not be applied too tightly. In two or three days the dressings are to be renewed, and this is to be repeated at intervals till the floughs come away, when a healthy action of the parts will take place, and the cure soon be completed. Another method of introducing caustic, by which the sinuses may be completely filled, is to mix up the caustic with hog's lard, and roll the mats into small pellets within <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAUZE\">gauze</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, which may be easily introduced into the cavities.\n\nMany farriers have fallen into a mistake with respect to the nature and treatment of quittor, that has been the ruin of many horses. They suppose, that during the progress of this disease, a bone is formed which they call a quittor bone; and they think it necessary to remove this bone, before a cure can be completed. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> seems to have arisen from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of Laffitte, who conceived that the derangement which accompanied this disease originated in the cartilages being affected, which he affirmed were capable of being thus diseased, but incapable either of exfoliating like bone, or sloughing like ligament; and therefore that to promote a cure, the whole of the lateral cartilage on the affected side must be removed. But his first premises were erroneous, for cartilages are vascular, as we know by their being tinged with bile, and by their being at times absorbed; this is particularly the case with the lateral cartilages, which in almost all old horses are partly absorbed. As they are vascular, they must be capable of living action; though it is slow, and hence where disease exists, they will exfoliate like other parts. This practice of Laffitte has in this country been for some time tried among many of the more intelligent farriers, and was still further propagated by the late Professor St Bel. Many horses have been ruined by this injudicious practice; for the future elasticity of the foot, which is in a great measure dependent on these cartilages, must be lost; besides the necessary removal of the hoof to get at the cartilage, a false quarter almost always remains*.\n\nWounds are frequently inflicted in the soft parts of horses and dogs, and these are more common in the legs, feet, and joints, than in any other parts. The treatment of wounds must depend in a great measure on the part where they are inflicted, and the form of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> that produced them. A clean cut made in the muscular parts is easily healed, by applying flaps of sticking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a> as soon as possible, so as to keep the edges of the wound close together; or where plaster cannot readily be applied, by taking a flitch or two through the edges of the wound, and tying the flings gently together. When the edges are found to adhere, the flings must be cut away, and the holes which they made will soon fill up. If any considerable blood-vein has been wounded, it will be proper to secure it, if possible, by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGATURE\">ligature</a>, rather than by applying any styptic substance. All wounds should be made as clean as possible, before any attempt is made to heal them. Sometimes the wound is so situated that it will not admit of being sewed up; but in these cases we may in general pass silver or steel pins from the edges, at about an inch distance from each other, and twist a thread crooked from one to the other, so as to form what is called the twisted suture. In all cases where sutures are used, it will be proper to apply a sticking plaster over the edges of the wound. If the wound should not heal by these means, a formation of matter will take place, and then the sore is to be treated as a common ulcer, taking care that its edges be always kept as near together as may be, by sticking plaster or a bandage.\n\nIf the wound is very large, it may excite considerable inflammation and fever. In these cases, if the animal is plethoric, it will be proper to bleed him, or at any rate to administer cooling remedies. If, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, there has been much loss of blood, or if the wound shows no disposition to heal, and the matter formed is thin and ichorous, an opposite plan of treatment will be required. The animal must be supported by nourishing food, and strengthening remedies.\n\nThe most troublesome wounds are those of the feet and joints, as they are in general very difficult to be healed.\n\nWounds in the feet are not uncommonly produced by the horse treading on sharp stones, broken glass, the feet, sharp bones or nails. These are generally punctured wounds, and will be considered presently. Sometimes a deep wound is made on the coronet, by a sharp part of the heel of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOE\">shoe</a> on the opposite foot, or any other substance penetrating downwards between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COFFIN\">coffin</a>-bone and the hoof, or between the lateral cartilages of the coffin-bone and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>. Wounds of this kind are attended with much danger, from the difficulty of evacuating the matter that may be formed, or of producing that healthy action in the parts that is necessary to make them heal. In such cases Mr Feron recommends the application of a blister, extending from the fetlock to the foot, so as to produce external irritation, which may relieve the internal parts. In the meantime the foot is to be kept in a vessel of warm water all day, and a large warm poultice of bran and water is to be applied round it at night. The intention of this practice is to prevent suppuration, but if this should, nevertheless, take place, and if matter should be formed between the hoof and the sensitive laminae; the suppuration is to be encouraged, and we are to endeavour to prevent the formation of sinuses, by rasping the hoof very thin, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> below the seat of the wound, so that we may be able to make an orifice for the evacuation of the matter downwards. Mr Feron advises\nadvices to delay this opening as long as possible, and when it is performed, to take care that the lamina be properly pricked after the operation, to prevent coming out through the hoof, and forming an incurable sandcrack, or false-quarter. The bathing the foot in warm water, and the application of the bran poultice, must be continued till the foot is perfectly healed. If proud fleas should appear through the opening that has been made in the hoof, it is to be pared away with a sharp knife, then fixed, and covered with a small pendent spread with soft ointment, on which is sprinkled a little powdered blue vitriol. It is evident that, during the cure, the horse must be kept perfectly at rest; and it is recommended to administer diuretics, and now and then a gentle dose of physic, to keep the bowels moderately open.\n\nWounds in the joints are commonly attended with very serious consequences, as it frequently happens that the capsular ligament is divided, and in this case the synovia or joint-oil constantly exuding through the opening, prevents the disposition to heal. A wound in the joints is common among horses in the army, and such as are employed in hunting; and a horse that has received such a wound in general becomes perfectly useless, from the improper method of treating these wounds that has in general prevailed among farriers. By their treatment, either an incurable sinus is produced, or a secretion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONY\">bony</a> matter takes place within the joint, forming what is called an anchylosis or stiff joint. The method generally practised by ordinary farriers is, to inject within the joint a mixture of turpentine and oil of vitriol, a solution of corrosive sublimate and lime water, or some other corrosive substance. The more rational of them content themselves with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INJECTION\">injection</a> of tincture of myrrh. All these substances produce such a high degree of inflammation within the joint, as not unfrequently to destroy the animal.\n\nOf late, a much more rational mode of treatment has been adopted by Mr Coleman, and is described in the first number of the Veterinary Transactions.\n\nThe following is the method recommended by Mr Coleman for treating wounds of the joints and capsules.\n\n\"Where a joint, a mucous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPSULE\">capsule</a>, or the sheath of a tendon is opened, the first application necessary is the actual cautery. The instrument most proper for the operation should be made of iron, two feet in length, rounded at the extremity about the size of a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTON\">button</a>, with a wooden handle. The temperature of the iron should be moderately red. If it be black, the heat will not be sufficient to produce a proper discharge of lymph, to close up the wound; and if it is white, it will destroy too much of the surrounding parts, and perhaps do mischief to the ligament. Although the operation in itself is very simple, yet some knowledge of the structure and economy of the parts, for the purpose of applying the cautery with the best possible effect, is necessary. The object in view is to produce a glutinous substance to close up the cavity, and before the slough is removed, for granulations below to supply the place of the lymph; but if the ligament itself be destroyed by the cautery, it must, like other dead parts, separate from the living and come away, and then the joint will still be opened. It is, therefore, of importance not to destroy the ligament of joints with the hot iron, but confine its application to the external soft parts. In these cases, it is generally proper to cauterize the whole external surface of the wound; and if the discharge is not immediately stopped, the iron has probably not been applied sufficiently deep, or too cold, to produce a proper discharge of lymph. Where a cure is possible to be effected, the actual cautery will frequently close the cavity and stop the discharge. Sometimes, however, in the course of one, two, or three days, the discharge appears again by the sides of the lymph, and then the same operation should be repeated. In some instances Mr Coleman has had occasion to apply the hot iron five or six times, and nevertheless succeeded ultimately, without the least lameness. The same treatment is likewise to be recommended for penetrating wounds into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a>. The lips of the wound should be cauterized, and, if requisite, repeated in the same manner as is recommended for wounds of other cavities. When the cavities of veins become inflamed, some little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> is necessary in the treatment, as accidents of that nature are frequently attended with consequences different from the opening of other cavities, and require a trifling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in the treatment. When a hemorrhage takes place, it may be very generally stopped by the application of the cautery; but if this fails, and the parts are too much swollen to admit of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a>, there is no other remedy than to take up the vein by a ligature above the diseased parts; and there may be instances in which it may be advisable to tie up the vein below. In general, however, the actual cautery will prevent the necessity of a ligature; and if it fails, tying up the vein will succeed only in those cases where the vein above is free from disease. In general, the vein is thickened and inflamed, and if a ligature be applied on a vessel in a state of inflammation, the disease will be formed, and the vein inflame above. In a case that occurred to Mr Goodwin, veterinary surgeon at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, where the jugular vein was tied, an abscess took place over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCIPITAL\">occipital</a> bone, commonly termed the poll evil. That disease, however, most probably did not originate in consequence of the tube being obliterated, for in most successful cases of inflamed veins, the sides of the vein unite and destroy the cavity. After the orifice of the inflamed vein, from the application of the actual cautery, is closed, a considerable degree of swelling frequently remains, and this may be removed by a blister. When abscesses form in the adjacent parts, they should be treated in the same manner as common abscesses.\"\n\nA puncture of some part of the lower surface of the foot is a frequent occurrence. It may arise from the wounds prick of a nail in shoeing, from a nail picked up in travelling; or from glass, flint, or any other sharp body. Injuries of this kind are proportioned in their effects, to the parts punctured, and not entirely to the depth of the wound. A puncture of the frog penetrating even to the fleshy frog, is not usually so serious, as that which penetrates the sole; hence a wound anywhere at the hinder part may penetrate deeper with impunity than towards the centre, and likewise in the front, though considerable inflammation usually follows from this last. When the capsular ligament is wounded in these cases, the consequence may be very serious, as a stiff joint is commonly produced. When it is found that the capsular ligament has been wounded, the external opening must be enlarged, and a hot iron must be applied to\nthe surface of the skin that covers the wounded part of the ligament, in order to heal up the internal opening. Considerable irritation commonly attends a punctured wound of the tendon, or its sheath; and it is best removed by enlarging the wound that is made through the horny part, and keeping the feet for some time in warm water. When matter appears in either of these cases, it must be let out, and the wound must be healed in the usual manner.\n\nThe most usual case of punctures is that which arises from a nail in hoeing taking a wrong direction, when instead of penetrating the outer surface of the crust, it turns inwards, and thus wounds the sensitive laminae. This is known to the smith at the time by a peculiar feel in the stroke he gives, and by the flinching; when, if the nail is immediately removed, and has not penetrated far, the wound heals by the first intention; but if it is suffered to remain, it produces inflammation and suppuration. As soon as this is discovered, a depending orifice should be made for the matter, by making an opening in the line of the hole at which the nail entered. It is always prudent, when a nail has penetrated, and lameness follows without matter appearing, to remove the shoe, and enlarging the opening to apply a pledget of tow dipped in spirits of wine, which will frequently prevent any future effects: but whenever matter has formed, it is indispensible necessary; for otherwise the matter will proceed upwards, and coming out at an opening on the coronet, it will form a quitter. When by this treatment the matter has gained a depending situation, and the inflammation has subsided, the part may be dressed with any mild ointment; but if the matter should increase in quantity, it will be proper to pour a solution of white vitriol within to promote a stoppage of the discharge, and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the ulcerative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>. In every puncture, when the heat and inflammation appear considerable, bleeding at the toe is a prudent measure, as it cools the vessels.\n\nDogs are frequently wounded with thorns in their feet or knees, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THORN\">thorn</a> may be so deeply lodged, that it cannot easily be extracted. When the foot is wounded with a thorn, the best application is a plaster of black pitch, which is said to have succeeded when every thing else has failed. If there is much inflammation, it will be proper to apply a poultice over the plaster. When a dog is wounded in the knee, if there is reason to suppose that a thorn is left in the wound, the same applications will be proper; and when the thorn comes away, if there is still an oozing of fluid from the orifice, a red-hot iron must be applied, as in the wounds of the joints in horses. If no thorn is left in the wound, a little digestive ointment rubbed upon the part, and a subsequent application of a poultice made with Goulard and crumbs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, with proper rest, will probably soon effect a cure.\n\nLameness is not unfrequently produced by a stiff joint, or what the surgeons call ankylosis. This is generally the effect of an injury done to the articulating surfaces of the bones that compose the joint, causing the formation of new bony matter, which gets between the bones, and unites them together. A stiff joint may perhaps be sometimes prevented by the timely use of blisters and firing; but when completely formed, the lameness is incurable.\n\n2. The second head of causes that produce lameness will comprehend strains, fractures, and luxations.\n\nStrains may take place in any of the muscular parts, or ligaments, but they most commonly happen in the fleasty part of the shoulder, or in some of the ligaments of the feet.\n\nA strain in the muscles of the shoulder, has been generally called a shoulder-flip, under the idea that the shoulder-bone has been disjointed, or the blade-bone pushed out of its place; but the fracture of the parts shews that the former of these accidents can scarcely happen, on account of the great strength of the capsular and other ligaments that surround the shoulder joint; and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISLOCATION\">dislocation</a> of the blade-bone is, by the extent and strength of the muscles that unite it with the ribs, nearly impossible, unless by such a force as is sufficient to destroy the texture of the muscles, and tear the limb from the body. A strain of these muscles, and of the ligaments that surround the shoulder joint, is, however, by no means an unfrequent occurrence, but affections of other parts are often mistaken for a shoulder strain, as we shall see presently. A strain in the shoulder, when first received, is generally attended with considerable inflammation and swelling of the part, which are usually sufficient to distinguish it from other affections. When the strain has continued long, and the inflammation has subsided, the distinction is not so easy.\n\nIn cases of recent shoulder strains, it will be proper to draw blood from the plate vein, and if the inflammation is extensive, to administer a purge, and keep the animal rather low, to keep down the inflammation as much as possible; and it will be proper to bathe the parts frequently, with some astringent lotion, or with a warm fomentation, as directed under bruise. A rowel may also be placed in the chest, or a feton in the inside of the fore-leg. Complete rest is necessary; and to render this the more perfect, the horse should be fitted with a patten shoe, and should have a bed of litter constantly below him. When the inflammation has subsided, gentle friction, and the occasional use of astringent lotions, will in general soon restore the use of the limb; and as soon as the horse can bear it, moderate exercise may be employed.\n\nInjuries done to the ligaments and tendons, are also usually called strains; but if we understand by this term, the inflammation of the strained part, the appellation is improper, since the tendons appear to be entirely without tendons, elasticity, and the ligaments nearly so. These parts cannot, therefore, be properly strained, though by unusual exertion, their texture may be so far injured as to produce stiffness, inflammation, and swelling, but will have the same effect in causing lameness, as a strain.\n\nInjuries of this kind are more dangerous than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> muscular strains, their treatment is more difficult, and the cure more tedious. The treatment usually adopted by ordinary farriers, is to apply the same astringent and stimulating lotions, as in strains; but here they commonly do harm, as they generally produce a greater secretion of coagulable lymph, which still more obstructs the motion of the part, and renders the lameness permanent.\n\nOne of the worst cases of these injuries, is what farriers\nWhen a horse trips or stumbles, and makes an unusual effort to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> himself from falling, or when the heels are lowered in shoeing too suddenly, or too much at once, so as to throw too great a weight upon them, there often happens such a sudden or violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the flexor muscles as may produce a partial laceration, or even rupture of the flexor tendon, or its sheath. This injury is attended with considerable inflammation, and the consequent lameness is of the worst kind. A great stiffness and swelling is produced, and there is commonly an effusion of fluid, which is at first serous, and may again be taken up by the absorbent vessels; but if improper applications are employed, coagulable lymph may be poured out, so as to obstruct the motion of the part, and produce that swelling, or permanent enlargement, that we sometimes see in the neighborhood of the tendon, after what is called a strain of the back finews.\n\nWhen a horse is strained in the back finews, he puts forward his leg and foot in a loofe, faint, and faltering manner. Mr Lawrence gives the following directions for ascertaining whether or not a horse is injured in the back finews. To try how far the horse has been injured, let him be walked about for half an hour, when the swelling of his legs will in all probability subside. If you then observe the tendo achillis, or main finew, distinct from the flank; if, on pressing it with the finger towards the bone, you find it firm and tense; if you discover by the feel, no soft spongy finews between the flank and the tendon, no extraordinary pulsation, but that all is well braced and wiry, you may conclude the swellings not dangerous. A person of experience, with a nice discriminating finger, will scarce ever fail to detect lameness in the back finews.\n\nMr Feron is of opinion that the injury which we have described is not done to the flexor tendon, but to the ligaments of the neighboring joints. He says, that \"on the direction of a strain supposed to be in the back finews, we discover no affection in the substance of this part, which on the contrary appears perfectly sound. But on examining the ligaments of the fetlock, coronet, and foot, we find them to be the seat of the disease; we find also, that if the accident has been violent, and of long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, the whole vascular system of the leg is found affected, but never, or very seldom, the back finews; it is in this violent state that we observe sometimes one or two swellings along the tendons. It is also on this account that the pain is so great, and so hard to be cured, in consequence of the considerable irritation which takes place in the surrounding parts.\" So the increase of thickness of the leg, is nothing more than the effect of the disease; but not the disease itself, as farriers, grooms, &c., suppose it to be. Nevertheless, we said before that the back finews or tendons were void of feeling in a state of health and incapable of extension. It may be very true that this injury is not commonly seated in the tendon; but we cannot agree with Mr Feron, that this part is never the seat of it, especially as he himself allows that a rupture of the tendon may take place, of which he has seen different instances. It is not difficult to conceive that the same exertion which when in a great degree is capable of rupturing the tendon, may in a smaller degree produce a partial laceration, or a strain in the back finews.\n\nA horse labouring under this injury, even after the inflammation has subsided, is extremely weak and stiff in the joints of the foot; but when he has been for some time at work, the lameness in some measure goes off. This has led some persons to suppose that a strained horse may be worked sound; but this is a very erroneous opinion, and the practice of continuing to work a horse that has been newly strained, under the idea of removing the stiffness, is equally cruel and injudicious.\n\nThe treatment of strains or injuries of the ligaments or tendons must be such as will most effectually prevent inflammation, and promote the absorption of the effused fluid. Local bleeding from the veins of the part, and warm fomentations frequently repeated, seem to be the most advisable; and a bandage should be always applied where the nature of the parts will admit of it, and should be continued till the lameness is removed. Various stimulating applications have been recommended in these cases, as soon as the inflammation has subsided, such as oil of turpentine, camphorated spirit, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a>, &c.; but they must not be employed while any considerable inflammation remains. It is somewhat remarkable that Mr Feron recommends astringent and stimulating applications in the text of his work, and says there that they may be employed with safety; but, in a note at the foot of the page, he speaks of having inferred those astringent prescriptions for the purpose of satisfying the different opinions, but that he is fully convinced, by a long experience, that warm fomentations and warm poultices of bran and water, are infinitely preferable in strains or contusions, to these expensive prescriptions, and are always to be tried first.\n\nIt will be proper to elevate the heels of the horse's shoe by calkins, and Mr Blaine recommends that the heels of the hoof be encouraged to grow, or that a thick-heeled shoe be used. If there still remains much swelling, firing will prove one of the most effectual remedies, as it will both promote the absorption of the effused fluid, and will produce such a degree of contraction of the skin as will answer the purpose of a permanent bandage. In such cases the cautery must be applied, so as to make perpendicular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> on the skin.\n\nDogs are very subject to strains; and where there are strains of flight, a mixture of spirit of wine and oil of turpentine, the stiffest or strong Goulard, applied before a fire, is the most useful remedy. Sometimes from blows or other accidents, such as slipping their hind-legs, or getting them entangled in the bars of a gate, hounds are lam'd in their stifles, as it is called. In general the above applications and long rest will remove the lameness; but when a considerable quantity of coagulable lymph has been effused, it is not easily re-absorbed, and the lameness continues. When this happens, some huntsmen recommend the operation of cutting for the stiffle, and Mr Daniel speaks of a huntsman who used to perform this operation very dexterously in the following manner. The bone is laid bare by a transverse cut, and upon it is found a substance like a stiff jelly, which is the cause of the lameness, and is in fact the coagulable lymph that has been effused. This jelly is taken away, and a wire is run through the ball of the hind-foot on the contrary side, and twisted in such a manner as to keep that leg from touching the ground, so that the hound may be compelled to use the lifted leg. In this way the dogs were always cured. The same huntsman recommended that\nthat when a dog had been entangled in a gate or flite, he should, as soon as released, be taken by the hind-feet, and twisted round five or six times, turning with him; and it is said that this prevented any ill consequence from the bruises that he received in the flite, while endeavouring to disengage himself.\n\nSome of the ligaments or tendons of the extremities are now and then ruptured. This is not a common case, but it may happen, either to the suspensory ligament, or the back finew.\n\nA rupture of the suspensory ligament is found most likely to happen to young horses while breaking, and to cavalry horses while under training. The accident is generally called breaking down, as when it happens the horse appears unable to support himself. The fetlock is brought almost to the ground, and the limb is evidently exceedingly weak; but the horse can bend his foot when he raises it. This circumstance distinguishes a rupture of the suspensory ligament from that of the flexor tendon or back finew; as, in the latter case, the power of the flexor muscle being destroyed, the horse is unable to bend the foot.\n\nIt appears from the observations of Mr Coleman, and some experiments that have been made by Mr Feron, that the flexor tendon has little or no effect in giving support to the heels; but that this office is almost entirely performed by the suspensory ligament. Hence, when this is ruptured, the horse loses one of his principal stays, and the foot is of course unable to support its usual weight, whence the horse breaks down.\n\nA perfect cure of this accident can seldom be expected; and the only way to relieve the animal will be to obviate the inflammation as much as possible, and to elevate the limb, and especially to raise the heels, in order to relax the injured parts. An intermediate substance will in time be produced between the two parts of the broken ligament, that will enable the horse to walk and perform some of his functions, but he cannot afterwards be depended on for the road or the field.\n\nWhen it is ascertained that the back finew has been ruptured, which is discovered by the inability of the horse to bend his foot backwards, it is generally recommended to kill the horse, as a cure is by most deemed impracticable. Mr Blaine recommends to bend the limb from the ankle downwards, and to keep it in that situation by throwing the animal, when he thinks that a perfect cure might be made. There would, however, be considerable difficulty in keeping the limb in such a confined situation for so long a time as would be necessary to unite the ruptured tendon; and after all, there is the greatest probability that a very slight exertion would produce a fresh rupture.\n\nFractures of the bones may take place in any part of these animals, but they are most common in the feet of horses and the legs of dogs.\n\nThe navicular, coffin, and small pastern bones of a horse are not unfrequently fractured, and Mr Feron speaks of a small pastern bone being broken into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> pieces. It is not surprising that these bones should be broken, when we consider the immense weight that is generally sustained by them, and the great exertions which a horse sometimes makes to recover a fall.\n\nThese bones, when broken, will be united by a callus, provided that the limb be kept in such a situation as to prevent motion; but this can rarely be effected, even in cases where the bones of the foot are fractured, still less in those cases where a fracture of the larger bones has taken place.\n\nOne of the most common fractures of the bones in a horse is that of the ridge of the ilium, or haunch-bone, of the horse. This bone, from the projecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> formed by its ridge, is peculiarly exposed to injury; and when the ridge is unusually prominent, as sometimes happens, or when the horse is more than commonly lean, the probability of fracturing this bone is still further increased.\n\nFractures of the haunch-bone may be occasioned by falls, by blows, which are often given by brutal riders and carters, with the butt end of a large whip, or perhaps a broomstick, and they are very commonly produced by striking the haunch violently against a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a>, or the edge of a wall, when the horse turns too sharply round a corner, or passes swiftly through a narrow gateway.\n\nIt may be ascertained that such an accident has taken place, by the pain the horse feels in the part, and where the fracture is considerable, by the cracking of the parts of the broken bone against each other, but still more certainly by an evident cavity of the haunch, from the depression of the ridge. The muscles of the belly in the upper part of the flank will appear sunk in, especially when the horse lies down, and will form a sort of hollow between the haunch and the ribs. The horse, when he attempts to move, will be as lame as if one of the bones of the leg were broken, owing to the extreme pain that motion excites in the muscles, that before being severely bruised, have lost one of their principal attachments.\n\nWhen an accident of this kind has happened, it is necessary to keep the animal perfectly at rest, as nothing but repose can produce a reunion of the fractured bone. The parts may be gently rubbed with some stimulating liniment, as in other cases of bruises, and some recommend the application of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>, or strengthening plaster. It sometimes happens, where only a small part of the bone has been broken off, the horse completely recovers his former activity; but more commonly such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFORMITY\">deformity</a> is produced by the ridge of one haunch remaining lower than that of the other, and by the callus that forms between the end of the divided bone, as to render the horse more or less permanently lame.\n\nWhen the legs of a dog are broken, it is easy, by means of splints, to keep the limb in such a situation as to effect a union of the broken bone; and we have not unfrequently met with cases of this kind, where a complete cure has been effected in the course of a few weeks.\n\nThe ribs of a horse are sometimes broken, either by falls, or from the brutality of their keepers, as by striking them with the heavy handle of a whip or cudgel. If the end of the fractured rib does not penetrate into the chest, so as to wound the lungs, a cure may in general be readily effected, by fastening a bandage round the body over the seat of the fractured rib, and keeping the horse at rest and on a low diet.\n\nLuxations or dislocations of bones are exceedingly uncommon in the horse, owing to the great strength of the\nDiseases, the ligaments that surround the joints. These may, however, sometimes happen, and we are by no means of Mr Blane's opinion, that the immense strength of the muscles in a horse would prove any obstacle to the complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of such a luxation. If, indeed, we endeavoured to reduce the luxation by pulling and hauling at the luxated limb, in order to overcome the power of the muscles, and thus produce a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a> extension, which is still, we believe, the method generally employed by surgeons to fet a dislocated limb in the human body, we shall most certainly be disappointed. But if, instead of this vain attempt, we place the limb in such a situation as that the power of those muscles which are the antagonists of the muscles that keep the limb in its dislocated place, may be fairly exerted, there will probably be little difficulty in replacing the bone in its socket, as the very strength of the muscles will assist us in the operation.\n\n3. Lameness is very commonly the effect of tumours of the mucous bags or capsules, or of excrescences formed on the bones of the legs and feet, or on the hoof.\n\nIn most of the joints there are appendages or membranous bags, called bursae mucosae, or mucous bags, that are filled with a mucous fluid secreted into their cavities, for the purpose of afflicting the motions of the muscles and tendons near the joint. It often happens that these mucous capsules are enlarged, either from hard work, which is a very common cause of their enlargement, or from some injury done to the neighbouring parts. When the enlargement is but small, it is of little consequence, but when the bags become unusually distended, their size impedes the motion of the joints. These tumours have received different names among grooms and farriers, according to the place where they are seated.\n\nWind-galls. When the mucous bags that are situated near the paterns become enlarged, the tumours are called wind-galls.\n\nBog-spavin. When the enlargement takes place in the mucous bags on the inner side of the hock, the disease is called bog-spavin.\n\nThorough-pin. When the tumours are seated in the upper and back part of the hock, between the gemelli muscle and the tendons of the great flexor muscle of the foot, the affection is called thorough-pin.\n\nWhen the swelling is situated at that part where the tendon of the gemelli muscles is inserted into the point of the hock, it is called capulet or capped hock.\n\nOf all the various swellings, the wind-galls are the most likely to produce lameness, and next to them the bog-spavin. The capulet and thorough-pin are seldom of much consequence.\n\nIn the treatment of wind-galls and similar tumours, the object is to remove the unusual swelling, and to prevent its return. The swelling can be removed only by evacuating the contents of the tumour, or by promoting its absorption. The former was recommended by Dr Bracken, and appears to have been successful in a few cases. The tumour is opened with a sharp knife; and when the fluid has been evacuated, an echarotic substance composed of burnt alum, white vitriol, and red precipitate, is applied to the wound, to produce such a degree of inflammation as may contract its cavity. Probably firing would have a better effect. Mr Coleman and the alveus of the veterinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, are much adverse to this operation, and certainly where it can be avoided it is not desirable. Absorption of the accumulated fluid may often be produced by the application of blisters, and other stimulating applications; but this is most certainly effected by producing pressure on the tumour, by means of a bandage applied round the part, with a bolster or compress immediately over the swelling. When the unusual enlargement has been reduced, its return is best prevented by firing the skin, so as to produce a considerable degree of contraction.\n\nHorses are subject to various excrescences on the splints, bones, or exostoses, as they are called, which, when they form near the joints, or below the tendons of the muscles, generally produce lameness. These excrescences have received various names, according to their situation. When they are formed about some part of the knee or cannon bone, they are generally called splints, though farriers often call the excrescences at the knee effeteles; and when there are two small bony enlargements near each other, they are called fuszes. The excrescences at the knee are not very common, and when they occur, are generally the effect of a wound; but splints about the cannon bone are very common, especially among young horses, owing to the blood-vessels in them being larger in proportion to the absorbents than in old horses; and hence the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> of bony matter may, in certain cases of injury, be greater than what the absorbents are able to take up again. These excrescences are easily produced in young horses, by any blow or other injury that is capable of producing considerable inflammation; as striking part of the cannon bone which is the usual seat of splints in what is called the speedy cut, or by producing unusual pressure on one side more than on the other. Although a splint may not be in the neighbourhood of any material tendon, it may still produce lameness by the pain which it excites; but when it interferes with a tendon, or some important ligament, lameness must in general be the consequence.\n\nWhen an excrescence appears on any of the bones that enter into the formation of the hough, it is called vin Bone-spavin. It is most frequently found on the upper and inner part of the small metacarpal bone, or on some of the wedge-like bones on the inside of the hock. In the former situation it is often produced in consequence of the outer heel having been raised by calkins; and in what are called cat, cow, or flickle-hammed horses, it is often brought on by their natural deformity, though in these latter cases the excrescence is most commonly formed on the inside of the hock.\n\nAn excrescence situated on the back part of the hock towards its point, is called a curb. This is sometimes formed on the bone, but it is frequently only an unusual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> and swelling of some of the ligaments.\n\nWhen an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXOSTOSIS\">exostosis</a> forms on the lesser patern bone, Ring-bone, producing a hard swelling round the coronet, it is called a ring-bone. A deposition of bone over the lateral cartilages is sometimes also called by the same name.\n\nThe treatment of all these excrescences is much the same, and our object must be, either to excite the absorbent vessels to increased action, so as to remove the bony excrescence, or to take this away by means of an operation. The former of these is not likely to be successful,\nDiseases, except in the early stage of the complaint, when the bony matter is not completely hardened. If the excrescence be discovered in time, blisters are to be applied over the part, and repeated frequently, and strong mercurial ointment, or an ointment composed of corrosive sublimate and blistering ointment, is to be applied over the part, and gentle friction should be frequently employed on those parts of the limb that are above and below the swelling. By these means the excrescences may sometimes be removed; but when they have become too hard, these stimulating applications will scarcely excite the absorbents to sufficient action. The only method to which we can then have recourse is an operation long ago practiced by the old farriers, apparently with considerable success. The bony excrescence is laid bare, by making an incision through the integuments, and then the excrescence is cut off by means of a sharp chisel struck by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALLET\">mallet</a>. After this the skin is to be laid down over the part, and we are to endeavour to heal the wound as soon as possible, by sticking plaster and a proper bandage. Firing is much employed by the French for the removal of ring-bones and other excrescences. Mr Lawrence recommends that in firing a ring-bone, the instrument employed should be thinner than usual, and that the lines described should not be more than one-fourth of an inch distant from each other, being crossed obliquely like a chain.\n\nSometimes an inflammation takes place on the lower part of the hoof, between the sensitive and horny soles, or between the outer crust and the binders, producing a slight effusion of blood, and leaving a considerable tenderness in the part. When the hoof is examined, after being perfectly cleaned, there is commonly seen a discoloured spot, sometimes red, but more usually blue, or blackish, like what is seen below one's nail, when the finger is jammed. The affection is commonly called by farriers a corn. (In Scotland, we believe it is called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>-crust), though it is by no means similar to a corn in the human foot. Horny excrescences which might properly be called corns, are sometimes however produced on the horse's hoof; and of this nature, we suppose, were the corns on the feet of Giefar's horse.\n\nThis complaint is always owing to an improper pressure on the horny sole, by which the sensitive sole is squeezed between it and the coffin bone. Hence a quantity of blood is effused from the vessels of the sensitive sole, which, if it remains for any length of time, produces an unusual tenderness in that part of the hoof. Corns are generally produced by shoes that are too hollow next the hoof, so as to allow a stone to get between the shoe and the sole, and thus press upon the latter; or it may be produced by the shoe being made too short or too narrow, and thus indenting itself upon the sole between the binders and the crust.\n\nThe best manner of treating a corn appears to be, to remove that part of the sole which is immediately below the seat of the affection with a drawing knife, taking care not to cut farther than the seat of the effused blood; then to insert a pledget dipped in tincture of myrrh, into the opening. No pressure must be applied upon the part, and a piece of the shoe opposite the corn should be cut out, to prevent pressure from taking place. The horse must be allowed to stand quiet, on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> surface, and must not be worked till the horny part of the sole that has been cut away shall be renewed; and even then it would be proper to turn him to grass for some time, without shoes, or with very small tips of iron at the toes.\n\n4. Lameness may be produced by many injuries of the feet, brought on by hard work, bad shoeing, or other ill treatment.\n\nWhen horses are ridden hard on pavement, or hard dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>, especially if the frog has been pared down, or even the crust cut away too much in shoeing, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTERING\">battering</a> produced on the hoof frequently brings on an inflammation of the sensitive part within. This may happen also to cart horses made to draw heavy loads, under similar circumstances.\n\nWhen the horse's hoof is not very delicate or tender, this battering sometimes only produces a stiffness, or swelling of the legs, and contraction of the sinews. This state is commonly called goggling, or a horse that has his feet thus battered, is said to be goggly.\n\nIf inflammation is excited within the hoof, a most Founder, painful species of lameness is produced commonly called founder, or the horse thus lamed is said to be foundered. The complaint is also called foot-founder, to distinguish it from a disease which we shall describe hereafter, and to which farriers sometimes give the name of body-founder. This inflammation may take place in any of the feet, or in all; but it is most commonly produced in the fore-feet: and as, from the pain which the horse experiences, he endeavours to throw as much as possible of his weight, upon his hind-feet, and appears unable to support himself on his fore-feet, he is said to be down before.\n\nThis complaint most commonly takes place in horses; but it may take place in cattle or sheep, brought on by hard driving, on hard stony roads, when sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAIRS\">fairs</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a>. In these animals, however, the complaint seldom proceeds to such a height as in horses; and it is in them more easily relieved.\n\nThe symptoms of founder are thus described by Mr Feron. \"Foundered horses have a general stiffness of the fore-hand, attended with a considerable acute pain of the joints, ligaments, and muscles, connected with it. The pain which the animal suffers on moving the joints, obliges him to keep the flexor muscles in a constant relaxed state, which position ultimately produces an entire debility and stiffness of every joint which composes the fore extremity of the animal. If the horse has been neglected, or the disease so rapid in its progress that it cannot be removed, the symptoms will increase so rapidly, that in a very little time we may observe the cuticular veins become turgid and varicose, similar to the lymphatic enlargement in farcy. In this state, exercise considerably increases the pain and violence of the symptoms, the animal falls off his food, his health becomes very much impaired, and a general decay of the whole limbs, particularly observable in the extensor muscles of the fore-arm, soon renders the animal useless for activity.\"\n\nWhen the complaint affects the fore-feet, the horse throws his hind-feet as far forward as possible, which leads those who do not understand the nature of the complaint to suppose that the horse is affected with a weakness in his loins. When it is feated in the hind-feet the horse throws his body forwards, in order to relieve.\nlieve the hind-feet of their weight. In this case the horse is supposed to labour under an affection of the chest, which has been called chest-founder.\n\nThe complaint usually comes on very rapidly, and sometimes appears a few hours after hard riding, or after the application of other causes, that will immediately be mentioned.\n\nIt may be easily known that a horse is foundered, as he can scarcely walk on first coming out of the stable, and evidently labours under great pain. Like many other affections that produce lameness, the horse appears to be relieved by exercise, but this relief is only temporary; and exercise only tends to increase the disease.\n\nMr Feron says, that, on dissecting the feet of foundered horses, he has frequently found the membranes of the joints thicker than in their natural state, and sometimes a disposition to anchyloysis, or stiff joint; which in some of the joints was evidently observed.\n\nThe founder is very commonly produced by battering the hoofs on hard ground. It may be brought on by any causes, that are capable of exciting inflammation in the internal sensitive parts of the foot. It is frequently produced by washing the legs of a horse, while sweating; and according to Mr Feron this is so evident, that if we observe the horses belonging to public coaches, in whom this practice is very common, we shall see that fifteen out of twenty labour under the torture of this disease. Founder may also proceed from allowing the horse, while sweating and fatigued, to stand long in a cold, damp air.\n\nIn the treatment of founder, the great object is to remove the inflammation, which is best done by bleeding in the veins of the foot, and the application of blisters about the joints. The toe of the affected foot must be removed, and the toe of the crust may then be pared to the quick, in order to produce a discharge of blood from the vessels of the affected part. It will be proper to pare the whole of the crust as thin as possible, especially at the heels and quarters, in order to allow the frog to come in contact with the ground. Blisters are now to be applied round the fetlock, down to the foot. Mr Feron recommends immersing the feet in warm water 24 hours after blistering, keeping them there all day, and applying a large warm poultice of bran and water at night. Mr Blaine, on the other hand, advises the use of cold astringent lotions, as Goulard or sal ammoniac in vinegar. Sometimes the pain in the feet is so violent, that the horse can scarcely bear to support himself upon them, and indeed if he could remain quiet, it would be better to let him lie down. But if he proves restless, he may be partly supported by means of a sheet drawn round him, with its corners pulled up to the ceiling of the stable by pulleys, so as to let the horse's feet just touch the ground.\n\nThe horse must be kept rather low, and if the inflammation is very great, or if there is any fever, it will be proper to administer cooling remedies, such as the drenches marked 22 and 25 in the receipts. The belly must be kept moderately open, and all exercise must be avoided.\n\nSometimes after the inflammation has subsided, the lameness still continues. This may be owing to the formation of horny matter between the sensitive and horny sole. Mr Blaine recommends that this be removed by cutting away the horny sole; but we much doubt whether this operation would be attended with the desired effect.\n\nFounder, properly so called, can take place only in those animals that have horny hoofs; but a similar affection not unfrequently occurs in the feet of hounds, dogs, after a long and fatiguing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a>. It consists in an inflamed state of the feet, produced by long running, especially over hard or stony ground. When the dogs come home their feet are hurt and swelled, inflamed, and sometimes cracked or chapped. The dog evidently feels considerable pain, and if he lies down for a little, he can scarcely be made to rise again. Dogs in this state are said to be flubbed in the feet, and are often so much lamed, that they cannot be taken out again for some days.\n\nWhen the inflammation is but slight, it requires but little attention, as the dog will himself allay the swelling and pain, by constant licking. When, however, the feet have been much bruised, the cracks pour out a bloody or purulent matter, and the case requires greater attention. The feet should first be bathed with warm water, and great care taken that no dirt or gravel be suffered to remain between the claws or in the cracks. After bathing, the feet may be rubbed with some digestive ointment, and a cold poultice composed of crumbs of bread well moistened with vinegar and water, should be tied round the affected foot.\n\nThe hoof of the horse frequently becomes lengthened, contracted, and contracted at the heels and quarters. This unnatural shape is commonly the effect of bad shoeing, by which the frog is deprived of the necessary pressure on the ground, and thus the heels are prevented from expanding, while the nails that are fixed in the quarters contribute to prevent expansion there, and thus the hoof is unnaturally lengthened at the toe. This contraction is considerably increased by the heat of ordinary stables; and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> that takes place from the hoof while the horse stands within doors, on account of the vacancy left below the frog, while the heels are elevated above the ground. Contraction of the hoof causes lameness, by producing an unnatural degree of pressure on the sensitive parts within, especially on the sensitive frog, which is not unfrequently inflamed in these cases.\n\nThe remedy for this defect is, to bring the frog gradually to press upon the ground, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a> the heels; but as, in the very sensitive state to which the feet are commonly brought by contraction, it might be dangerous to apply pressure to the frog at once, it is advisable to lower the heels gradually, in the manner directed in No. 146. If the frog is much diseased, as sometimes happens, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> shoe should be employed, by which means slight pressure may be made by fixing an iron plate from the heels of the shoe towards the toe. The best means of producing pressure in these cases would probably be to employ Mr Coleman's artificial frog. The upper part of the hoof should be rasped thin, especially at the quarters, as these parts of the hoof will then be more easily expanded by the motion of the lateral cartilages. The lower part of the hoof should also be kept moist, especially the frog.\n\nMr Blaine remarks, that dark-chestnut horses are more subject to contracted feet than others, and he relates a case of a mare belonging to himself, who had all her feet contracted. These he endeavoured to expand by\nDiseases by means of jointed shoes, furnished with a sliding bar, which was kept in its situation by means of pegs, so that in this way the heels of the shoe might be gradually widened, by moving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> bar farther towards the toe. This method is very ingenious, but Mr Blaine acknowledges that it did not fully answer his purpose.\n\nWhen the heels have been gradually lowered so far, that the frog can bear the proper pressure, the horse should continue to wear a thin-heeled shoe; but if he is not required to be worked, it would be better to fend him out to graze without shoes, where the pasture is not too dry.\n\nIt often happens in cases of contracted feet, and in some other cases, when the frog does not receive the due degree of pressure, that a running takes place from the cleft of the horny frog, occasioned by a degree of inflammation which is followed by a secretion of purulent matter. This complaint is commonly called a running thrush. While it extends no farther than the horny frog, it is seldom attended with any serious consequences; but if it be neglected, the matter extends through the horny to the sensitive frog and sensitive sole, and produces canker or quitter.\n\nSome horses have naturally a running from the cleft of the frog; and so long as this is slight, and the parts are kept clean, it is of little consequence. We know there are some persons who conceive a slight running thrush, as rather beneficial to a horse, and do not esteem it as a mark of unkindness; but we cannot agree with these gentlemen in either particular, as, though the complaint does not in itself absolutely render a horse lame, so long as his feet are properly attended to, it will, if neglected, degenerate into a foul ulcer, the matter of which may easily penetrate into the internal parts of the foot. A running thrush is very commonly the consequence of bad grooming, and suffering dirt and gravel to lodge in the clefts of the frog, and it is still more frequently produced in the common method of shoeing, by cutting and paring away the frog.\n\nIn the treatment of a running thrush, the principal objects are, to remove the cause that first produced it, and to stop the discharge of purulent matter. The latter is easily effected by applying to the part some stimulating liniment. Mr Blaine recommends for this purpose a composition of two ounces of tar, with five drachms of vitriolic acid, which is to be applied hot every day, by pouring it into the cleft of the frog from a spoon. The discharge, though easily stopped in this way, will soon return, unless the proper degree of pressure be given to the frog; and this is to be brought about by proper attention to shoeing the horse with thin-heeled shoes, taking care that the heels be lowered gradually, and slight artificial pressure be made on the frog, till it is become sufficiently healthy to bear the natural pressure of the ground.\n\nWhen the matter of a running thrush infatuates itself upwards to the sensitive parts of the foot, it forms what is called canker, in which there is a considerable inflammation, producing a luxuriant unhealthy fungus, springing up from all the diseased surface that is exposed, and producing a great degree of tenderness, and what may be called a rottenness of the hoof. If this disease continues for any considerable time, it attacks the whole substance of the foot, extending to the tendons, ligaments, and bones, till at last the foot may absolutely drop off with disease. Mr Coleman considers canker as generally the effect of too much moisture applied to the foot or hoof.\n\nTo check the progress of a canker, the whole of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCREMENT\">excrement</a> that appears on the external part of the hoof, is to be cut away close to the surface from which it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>, and such parts of the horny sole as appear to be detached from the sensitive sole, should be removed, to prevent the matter from lodging in the internal parts. When the diseased part is fairly exposed to view, it is to be washed with a solution of some metallic caustic, such as nitrate of mercury, No. 49 of the receipts, or a solution of lunar caustic, in the proportion of a drachm to two ounces of soft water. This is best applied by moistening a pledget of lint or tow, and confining this upon the cankered surface, by applying a regular pressure by means of cross bars of iron introduced beneath the shoe. A continuance of these applications, while the frog is gradually exposed to pressure, will in general soon stop the progress of the disease, and when this is removed, the horny parts of the hoof that had been cut away will be gradually removed; and by shoeing the horse properly afterwards, the disease will be prevented from returning.\n\nCattle and sheep are subject to a disease very similar to canker in the horse, producing a discharge of fetid matter from between the claws of the hoof, or sometimes from only one claw.\n\nThis affection in cattle is commonly called the foul, or the cattle are said to be foul in the foot. Managers of cattle commonly divide this disease into two kinds, the foul, and the horny, which are said to require different modes of treatment. In the foul, a running of very offensive matter takes place from the heels, or between the claws of the hoof; and the animal appears exceedingly lame. The treatment in this case consists in cutting away all the soft and spongy parts, and then applying a caustic liquid, such as will presently be described, for the foot-rot in sheep. The parts are then to be covered with a pledget spread with mild ointment, or, what is very common among farmers, a piece of fat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">bacon</a> may be wrapped round the part, tied on the foot, and suffered to remain for two or three days. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time the animal should stand very clean, and be allowed to rest as much as possible.\n\nThe horny foul seems to be very analogous to corns in horses. The animal is very lame, and, on examining the foot, the hoof feels very hot, and, when hard pressed, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a> evidently feels much pain. There will commonly be found some part of the horn penetrating into the softer parts of the foot, either at the heel, or between the hoofs. In the treatment it is necessary to cut away these parts of the horn, as well as any part under which there appears much inflammation. For this purpose, it will probably be necessary to castrate the animal, but care should be taken that he be thrown on a soft place. After the hoof has been pared away, a rag moistened with vinegar and water should be tied on, and the animal must be sent to graze in a soft smooth pasture. If the inflammation and pain are very great, it may be necessary to bleed from the veins of the foot.\n\nFoot-rot in sheep is called the foot-root, and is generally produced by their being kept on a wet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>. It is remarkable that salt marshes do not produce it. According\nto Mr Lawrence, frequent travelling to and from the fold, or by fiddling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EWES\">ewes</a> from the hot dung of a sheep-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, will occasion it. Some are of opinion, that it originates from the same cause which occasions chilblains in the human feet; and this opinion is maintained in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> on the diseases of sheep, affixed to Mr Findlater's Survey of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEEBLES\">Peebles</a>, where it is stated, that the remote cause of the disease is weakness, and the immediate cause cause cold and wet, as standing in cold weather upon wet pastures, with the feet constantly soaked in water. Dr Wilkinson of Enfield considers moisture as the predisposing cause, and has found the disease to be produced from the sheep continuing in long grails during a mild winter. The same cause generally, although perhaps gradually, operates upon the whole flock, and then it has been supposed that the disease is contagious. The late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Somerville had a piece of pasture which always produced the foot-rot on any sheep that were put into it; but the disease was entirely prevented or rooted out by a careful selection of the sheep in order, by paring the hoofs of those that began to be affected, and by the use of caustics not too corrosive. These appeared to be the most proper means of stopping the complaint, and the best caustic application is said to be the nitrate of mercury. It is evident, that, during the application, the hoofs of the sheep should be kept as clean as possible. Whether its greater or less prevalence depends on the less or greater attention paid to the sheep, is not perhaps fully ascertained. It is, however, certain that the sheep of some districts are entirely free from it. We are informed, that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TWEEDDALE\">Tweeddale</a> the complaint is scarcely known.\n\nThere is a disease in the horse's foot, in which the coffin-bone is forced backwards, and made to press unnaturally upon the heels, by which its edges being subjected to unusual pressure, become partly absorbed. Hence this bone losing its support, becomes pressed in its concave part, where inflammation is produced, and bony matter is thrown out, rendering the lower part of the coffin-bone convex instead of concave, and the sole is rendered unusually thin. This disease is called pumiced feet, and may be brought on in three ways; from improper shoeing, from inflammation, as in case of founders, and from a natural defect in the foot itself. It is said to be very common in wet soils. It is very commonly produced by applying the shoe red-hot to the horse's foot. Its immediate cause appears to be an inflammation of the sensitive laminae, by which a quantity of coagulated lymph or of bony matter is thrown out, that forces back the coffin-bone in the manner above described. When the disease is completely formed, it does not appear capable of being radically cured, but only admits of palliation. Mr Blaine recommends, that the growth of the sole should be encouraged by every means, but the foot should not be kept improperly moist. The best means would be, the turning the horse out without shoes in a dry pasture. No part of the heels or sole should be removed in this case, as the parts are already too slight. A shoe should be formed, if possible, that presents a hollow surface to the foot, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> one to the ground. This may be done, by making it of rather an increased thickness, which will admit of its being hollowed within, and bevelled from the outer to the inner edge of the web.\n\nSometimes perpendicular fissures or cracks are seen in the hoof extending between the fibres in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> direction from above downwards. These are called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>-cracks, and generally take place near the quarter, more frequently on the outer than the inner side, and oftener in the fore than the hind foot. These cracks sometimes come on suddenly, and then generally denote a contraction of the hoof. They are also said to have arisen from a wound in the vessel or part of the coronary ligament, bringing on a secretion of horny matter, which gets between the fibres of the hoof, and causes them to separate.\n\nThe means of preventing the crack from extending, are to thin the hoof where the crack has taken place as much as possible, and to make a transverse section a little way across at the upper part. If the crack should still continue to gape, it must be carefully covered, and the hoof bound round, so as to close it as much as may be, and the portion of the crust that rests on the shoe should be chambered away a little, by which means the divided parts will be more likely to come together.\n\nWhen a wound has been inflicted on the coronet, the coronary ligament commonly becomes injured, and its vascular part does not secrete so much bony matter as usual. Hence there is a space left between the old horny matter of the hoof, and the new that is formed from other parts; and this produces what is commonly called a false quarter. A false quarter may also be produced, in consequence of a quitter extending upwards through the coronet. As the sensitive laminae within the hoof are liable to be pressed in this vacant space between the horny edges, thus causing violent pain, the false quarter is attended with a lameness of the worst kind; for as this interference of the lamina sometimes takes place suddenly, while the animal is in motion, the pain makes him shrink, and he not unfrequently comes down.\n\nThe only way of remedying this defect is, to excite such an action in the coronary ligament as may dispose it to throw out new horny matter, and thus fill up the vacant space. This is best effected by removing the surrounding horn, and applying blisters to the coronet, while the part of the hoof that is opposed to the shoe should be hollowed away as much as possible, to admit of the separated parts approaching each other.\n\nWhen a horse in motion, especially in trotting, brings Cutting one foot so near another as to interfere, and thereby graze or wound one of the feet, he is said to cut. Sometimes the feet of a horse are in this way feverishly wounded, and temporary lameness is produced. In cutting, the horse may either wound the heels of the fore feet, with the toe, or side of the hind shoe, which is the most common case; or he may wound the fore part of the hind-foot, just above the hoof, by striking it against the heel of the fore shoe; or, lastly, he may bring two of the feet so closely together, as to wound the inner side of either.\n\nCutting may arise from a bad habit, or from a natural deformity of the feet, but it is very commonly the consequence of bad shoeing. When horses cut from turning out their toes, which is by much the most common cause, they are observed to have the inner quarter of the hoof lower than the outer, and the fetlock joints are thus nearer each other than those of horses which have their limbs straight. These facts led farriers to a conclusion, that if the inner quarters were raised to a level with the outer, and especially if made even\neven higher, the fetlock joints would be thrown further apart, so that the foot would pass the supporting leg without striking; Accordingly, it has been usual to make the inner quarter of the shoe higher than the outer, and this has been the common practice for a long time. Mr Morecroft, by making trial of a shoe, of a shape the reverse of what we have described, namely, having the outer quarter thick, and the inner thin, completely prevented cutting in the horse, on whom those shoes were tried, and the utility of the improvement has been confirmed by succeeding trials. According to Mr Blaine, the principle on which this is supposed to act is, that when a horse is at rest, he supports his weight equally on both feet; but, having his inner quarter much raised, in the common mode of attempting to remedy the defect of cutting, when one foot is elevated he must be supported obliquely on the other, and hence have a tendency to fall outwards; to prevent which he brings the moving foot nearer the supporting one, by which he strikes it. Considering it in this point of view, it is not difficult to account for our author's mode of reasoning on his method, which, by elevating the outer instead of the inner side of the supporting foot, must necessarily give it a disposition to lean inwards, and fall to the inside, which will throw the moving further from the supporting foot. But, ingenious as this mode of reasoning may be, it is to be feared, that by thus throwing an increase of weight on the inner side, we shall sometimes be in danger of producing evils, that will counterbalance the prevention of cutting.\n\nLameness may be produced by any one of the causes that we have mentioned, but it may happen that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of two or more of these causes takes place at the same time in different parts of the same limb: thus the foot may be pricked with a nail, and a strain may take place, nearly at the same time, in the sinews of the leg, or the ligaments of the joints; for the pain excited by the nail first makes the horse trip or stumble, and then, his making a sudden exertion to save himself, or ease the pricked foot, a strain of the ligaments or sinews frequently takes place. A similar complication is often produced in a horse that is affected with spavin, or other bony excrecences, as his exertion to save the limb that feels painful from the rubbing of the muscles or tendons against the spavin, may produce a severe strain in the muscles of the shoulder.\n\nAs the causes of lameness are so various, and the real seat of it frequently very obscure, a practitioner should be extremely cautious how he gives a decisive opinion with respect to either, before he has well examined the parts where lameness may take place, and enquired into every circumstance that may assist him in forming his opinion. For want of such precaution, and from a superficial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the part that is supposed to be the seat of the affection, egregious blunders and dangerous mistakes are not unfrequently committed, and applications have been made to parts that are really found, when it is afterwards discovered, to the confusion of the practitioner, that the real cause of the lameness was in a different place. Nothing is more common than for ordinary farriers to apply their liniments and embrocations to the shoulder, when in fact the affection that causes the lameness is located in the feet.\n\nAs, perhaps, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> cases out of ten, the foot is the part that has received the injury, this should first be examined with the strictest attention, the hoof should be made perfectly clean, especially in its under surface, to see whether there be any crack or fissure, any discolouration, any particular heat, &c. The pastern and all round the coronet should be also carefully inspected; and, if nothing is found, the examination should be repeated next day, or even a third time. The foot is more particularly to be suspected of being the seat of the complaint, when the lameness makes its appearance soon after the horse has been shod, or has had his hooves fastened; as the foot may be lamed by a nail in floeing, though the point of the nail has not penetrated to the quick. The nail may be so thick, or may pass near the quick, as to press in a small part of the hoof upon the soft parts, thus producing exquisite pain, and perhaps inflammation. It is therefore proper always to remove the shoe from the foot of the affected limb, and if the cause of lameness is not very evident to wait a few days, to see whether the removal of the shoe has produced any alteration for the better.\n\nNo certain rule can be laid down for judging of the seat of lameness from the motion of the affected limb, though this is considered by some as one of the surest marks. The deranged motion in one part of the limb very commonly arises from sympathy with another part that is the real seat of the affection.\n\nWe have now, we believe, mentioned all the important cases of lameness, except the firing-halt, or click-spavin. This is an affection of the hind quarters, producing a sudden jerking of the legs upwards, when the horse attempts to move. It appears to be a nervous affection, and seems to be somewhat analogous to the chorea, or St Vitus's dance, in children. We do not know that this affection has ever been cured, but it is said that it may be palliated by allowing the horse to run much at large, and letting him remain untied in a large stable. Mr Lawrence recommends that, after a hard day's work, both hind legs be immersed in a warm bath up to the hocks, and kept there as long as the water continues warm, when they are to be rubbed perfectly dry, and the same bath and rubbing repeated in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>. He also advises anointing the back sinews, and about the hocks, with strong camphorated ointment.\n\nWe have occasionally, in this and the preceding chapters, spoken of abscesses and ulcers, and their treatment; and we can add little here on that subject, as it will be fully treated of in the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURGERY\">Surgery</a>; and the instructions to be there laid down will apply nearly as properly to the inferior animals as to man. We may just remark, that foul ulcers, and such as do not heal kindly, are perhaps more common in some of the inferior animals than in man; and hence they require in the former applications of a more stimulating nature, to excite a proper degree of healthy action in the ulcerated part. There are a few particular ulcers which call for consideration in this article, and we cannot, perhaps, treat of them in any part of the treatise more properly than under the morbid affections of motion.\n\nThere sometimes takes place an inflammation, and consequent suppuration in the mucous capsules, at the articulation of the head with the first vertebra of the neck, near the insertion of the cervical ligament. This affection is commonly called the poll-evil. It is almost always\nDiseases. always the consequence of an injury done to the back of the head, by a horse's hanging back in his collar, by striking his head against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a> or manger; and is very frequently produced by a blow given on the head by brutal coachmen or carters. An ulcer in this part is often very difficult to heal, and when it extends beyond the skin, the matter sometimes infuses itself below the ligament of the neck, and on each side of it, and it not unfrequently produces a caries or rottenness of the vertebrae. The cure of the poll-evil is most easily effected when the inflammation is first discovered, before suppuration takes place; as, when once matter is formed, it commonly produces sinuses in the loose cellular substance about that part of the head, and these are not easily healed. When, therefore, we have reason to suppose that inflammation has begun in the skin of this part of the neck, every means must be employed to prevent its progress towards suppuration. A blister should be immediately applied over the part, and when this has done its duty, a solution of sal ammoniac in vinegar, or vinegar and water, should be applied by means of a cloth kept constantly wet. If a suppuration appears inevitable, it must be encouraged by fomenting the part frequently with warm water, or by the repeated application of warm poultices; and when the swelling appears sufficiently ripe, it must be opened, which is best done by introducing a feton from the highest to the most depending part of the tumour, as directed in No. 173. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> of the feton must be examined every day, wiped dry, and rubbed with a little digestive ointment, and the sore should be carefully excluded from the air.\n\nIf the suppuration has proceeded any length, before it is discovered, there will probably be a number of sinuses, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a>, as they are called, with matter lodging in each. If it can be easily effected, it would be proper to lay these open, and make them communicate with each other, or, if their direction can be ascertained, a feton may be passed through each. When a proper opening has been made for the matter, and care taken that none of it lodges, the sore will soon heal, by the application of the proper stimulating ointments.\n\nIt is sometimes necessary to employ the knife in this case; but when this is done, the greatest care should be taken not to wound the ligament, or, as the farriers call it, the fix-fax of the neck. The best method of avoiding this is, to have the animal's head fastened very high to the rack, by which the ligament will be more slack, and the finger can be easily introduced below it, so as to be a guide to the knife.\n\nWe mentioned in No. 341, the chafing of the back with the saddle. There is another injury of a similar kind, that is often suffered by the withers, from the saddle being allowed to press on them too long. This pressure and rubbing sometimes produces an inflammatory swelling, which, if it be not soon discovered, goes on to suppuration, and produces a sore which farriers call fistulous withers, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISTULA\">fistula</a> in the withers. This is also a very troublesome ulcer, as the matter sometimes penetrates below the shoulder, and makes its way down the bones of the fore leg; or, by infusing itself among the vertebrae of the back, renders them carious. The treatment in this case is much the same as in the last; the inflammation should be disinfected as soon as possible, and if matter forms, it should be evacuated by means of fetons. It is frequently required to pass a feton through the tumour on each side of the withers, in order to produce a proper inclination of the orifice, to carry off the matter. When sinuses form, they must be opened, as in the case of poll-evil.\n\nThere is sometimes a species of ill-disposed ulcers in the external part of the ears of dogs, very difficult to heal. It is generally called conker. These, when they heal, leave hardened edges, which frequently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> out again in the course of a few months. The best application in this case is lunar caustic applied to the edges, to encourage them to slough off; but if this should not be found sufficient, the best remedy will be to tear off the diseased parts with a red-hot knife, or they may be cut off by a simple incision.\n\nChap. III. Morbid Affections of Digestion.\n\nIn order that the food may be well digested, when received into the stomach, it is necessary that it undergo the previous operation of chewing; unless it be of such a nature, as to be easily soluble in the gastric juice, without this previous preparation. The latter is the case only with dogs, whose food consisting almost entirely of animal matter, requires little or no chewing. But the food of horses, sheep, and cattle in general, requires to be well chewed, either when first swallowed, or in sheep and cattle by subsequent rumination.\n\nThe mouth in these animals is sometimes swollen, sore-mouths or otherwise affected with sores or cracks, that it is with difficulty the animals can chew their food. Sometimes there are bloody chinks or chops in the palate, occasioned by thistles or other prickly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, which are mixed with the hay, or grow up among the grass. These should be washed on their first appearance with salt and vinegar, applied by means of a rag tied to a stick. If neglected, these chops frequently become inflamed and ulcerated. If pimples arise, they must be opened when they begin to suppurate, by means of a pointed cautery. There are sometimes found within-side the lip of cart horses and other ordinary cattle, soft tumours, or pustules with black heads, which are called giggers, bladders, or flips in the mouth. They do not always occasion much inconvenience, but sometimes they grow to a large size, so as to grow troublesome, and prevent chewing. When this is the case, they must be removed, either by fattening a thread about their roots, as directed in the treatment of warts, where they are of such a form as to admit of a ligature; or by the knife, applying afterwards the hot iron or cautery. In performing this operation, care must be taken to draw the tongue to one side, so that it may not be wounded. After removing these excrescences with the knife and cautery, the mouth may be washed with a solution of white vitriol or alum. Excrescences of a similar kind, called barbs or paps, sometimes grow below the tongue, and must be removed where practicable by means of ligature, as it is dangerous to employ the knife. When these excrescences are neglected, there sometimes arise in the mouth little ulcers with white specks, very similar to the aphthous crusts that form in the human mouth. It is recommended by some writers to use the cautery on these occasions; but probably a detergent lotion, such as we have just recommended, will answer the purpose of removing them.\nThe mouth or tongue of horses sometimes wounded with the bit or curb. When this happens, a lotion made with alum dissolved in water, and sweetened with honey, may be employed; and the bit should not be used again till the mouth is healed.\n\nMany veterinary writers have described the disease in the horse's mouth called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-LAMPAS\">lampas</a>, which is stated to be an inflammation and swelling of the first bar of the mouth in a young horse, so as to prevent his chewing. We believe that Lafaute and Dr Brecken were the first to deny the existence of such a complaint, which is now generally discredited among most of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> writers. We have no doubt that such a swelling may take place; but it can scarcely be attended with the ill consequences commonly attributed to it, or require such vigorous treatment as is usually recommended.\n\nIt may happen, that any of these animals shall have a difficulty of swallowing, from various causes; either from an unusual narrowness in the gullet, or from the morse attempted to be swallowed being too large. The latter very frequently happens to cattle who are fed upon turnips or potatoes; and the choking thus produced sometimes proves very dangerous, as, if the obstruction is not speedily removed, the animal will die for want of breath. The method commonly employed among country farmers for unchoaking cattle, as they term it, is to thrust down the throat a large stiff rope, ravelled at the end, and well greased. This often succeeds, but it is a clumsy method; and if the rope, by having been long used, or becoming dry, should lose its stiffness, it will be bent in endeavouring to force down the obstruction; or, if the ravelled end be not pretty large, or the obstructing morse of an irregular shape, the rope may pass between the side of the gullet and the obstruction, without this being removed. Several intelligent farmers have therefore laid aside the use of the rope, and have contrived an instrument similar to the probang employed by surgeons. An instrument of this kind has been already mentioned, in the description of Mr Hunter's feeding byre in No. 236. An account of one that appears to us to be more useful and ingenious, has been communicated to us by the reverend <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Findlater, minister of Newlands in Tweeddale. It is the contrivance of Mr Charles Alexander, a farmer in Mr Findlater's neighbourhood, and has long been employed by him for the purpose of relieving choked cattle. The following is Mr Alexander's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of his instrument, as politely described to us by Mr Findlater.\n\nTake three small canes, of the thickness of the little finger, or thereabouts, of the length of 5 feet, that they may reach down the throat, and into the stomach of the largest ox. These canes are to be bound together by strong smooth twine rolled tightly about them (the circles of the twine touching each other), from top to bottom. Bees wax is then to be rubbed along the twine, to fill up any inequalities, and the whole rod is to be well oiled before it is used. There is a round knob at each end, the larger 2\u00bd inches in diameter for larger cattle; the other less for lesser cattle. These knobs are formed of the twine rolled hard, and when formed may be strengthened in their position, by being sewed by means of a shoemaker's awl or brog, and a waxed bristle thread, such as they employ. The thread knobs are made tapering up the canes from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> extremity; but it must be remarked that the surface of this extremity is not rounded like a clue, but hollowed into the form of a cup. The intention of this hollowed form is, to make certain of catching hold of the obstructing body; as, if the knob was round, it might pass by it. After the knobs are formed, they are covered with soft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>, which by its flexibility will adapt itself to the hollow end of the knob as soon as it reaches an obstacle. The knobs must be securely fixed to the canes, for if they fall off, they leave an indigestible substance in the stomach. Such is Mr Alexander's probang, the only improvements on which that we would advise are, to make the knobs of sponge, firmly fastened to the canes, by passing twine through holes bored in them, and adding at each end two or three bights of twine, for the purpose of catching hold of any obstacle, thus making the instrument almost exactly like a surgeon's probang. We think the sponge preferable to the twine, as it will not be so liable to injure the animal's throat by its hardness, will adapt itself more readily to the form of the obstacle, and may be more firmly fixed to the canes.\n\nWhen cattle are put into a field of young clover, or rich grass, especially if they have previously been kept over-fed on poor or dry fodder, they are apt to eat voraciously or fog of their new repast, and the young succulent food, when sickened, received into the stomach, soon ferments, and produces such a quantity of air, as to swell the stomach to a violent and dangerous degree. Cattle thus affected are said to be over-fed, hove, or blown; or the affection of the stomach thus produced, is called over-feeding, or sometimes fog-ficking. If not speedily relieved, the animal's stomach not unfrequently bursts, from the inability to evacuate the accumulated air; for there seems, in these cases, to be a constriction of the gullet, so that the air cannot escape upwards, while the number of stomachs, and the spasmodic contraction produced by the unusual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a>, prevents its passage by the anus.\n\nThe necessity of speedily relieving the animal, prompted the employment of what must at first have been considered as a very desperate remedy; namely, stabbing the animal. An opening is made with a sharp penknife into the paunch, in the thin part between the last rib and the huckle bone; and through this the air rapidly escapes. Sometimes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a> of a quill is inserted into the wound, to prevent its closing before all the air that is produced during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a> of the food, has escaped.\n\nStabbing the animal, is a remedy that should not be had recourse to, but on the most urgent necessity; as the wound can seldom be made with such nicety as not to wound some important organ, especially some large blood-vessel. Indeed frequently the diffusion of the stomach, and consequently of the skin and muscles of the belly, is so great, that the moment the knife is introduced, a dreadful rent takes place, producing such a wound, as may be attended with fatal consequences.\n\nHappily this operation is not often necessary, as it is found that the administration of some internal stimulating medicines will check the fermentation of the green fodder, and promote the absorption of the extracted air. Many farmers have for some time given tar with this intention, administering an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a> shell full to each beast; of late, however, the use of ardent spirits has been introduced, and it is found that a pint or mutchkin of\nof whisky or gin, mixed with an equal quantity of water, is the most efficacious remedy. Laudanum has also been recommended, but probably it is not superior to common spirits (D).\n\nIt has been the practice with some farmers, to introduce on these occasions, the common rope employed in cases of choking, into the stomach, and move it up and down, so as to produce a gradual evacuation of the air; but we should suppose that the evacuation produced in this way must be extremely slow.\n\nDr Monro senior, professor of anatomy in the university of Edinburgh, some years ago contrived an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> tube, that might be introduced down the throat into the stomach of the animal, and thus speedily and effectually evacuate the air. A description of this instrument, and the manner of employing it, appeared in an Edinburgh newspaper, we believe, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a>'s authority. It has since been published in a popular treatise on the diseases of black cattle, entitled \"Rowlin's Complete Cow-Doctor,\" from which we have taken it.\n\nThe doctor begins by observing, that the swelling of the belly is owing to the distention of the stomachs by fixed air, disengaged from the succulent grass in consequence of fermentation, the discharge of which by the mouth seems to be prevented by spasmodic contraction of the upper orifice of the stomach. He concludes that the cattle may with certainty be saved, if the air be drawn off in due time, without injuring the stomach and bowels; and he affirms that this may be done with great ease by passing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> tube down the gullet into the stomach.\n\nThe tube is to be composed of iron wire, as large as a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOCKING\">stocking</a> wire, or about one sixteenth part of an inch diameter, twisted round a smooth iron rod, three eighths of an inch diameter, in order to give it a cylindrical form; and after taking it off the rod, it is to be covered with smooth leather.\n\nTo the end of the tube, which is intended to be passed into the stomach, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> pipe, two inches long, of the same size as the tube, and pierced with a number of large holes, is to be firmly connected.\n\nTo prevent the tube from bending too much, within the mouth or gullet, in time of passing it down into the stomach, an iron wire, one eighth of an inch diameter, and of the same length as the tube, is put within it, which is to be withdrawn, when the tube has entered the stomach.\n\nHe has found that the space from the fore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> of the under jaw, to the bottom of the first stomach of a large ox, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> about five feet, and he has passed such a tube, five feet and nine inches long into the gullet and stomach of a living ox. The tube ought therefore to be five feet long, that we may be sure of its answering in the largest oxen.\n\nAfter the tube is passed into the stomach, it may be allowed to remain for any length of time; as when it is pressed to one side of the throat, it does not intercept the breathing of the animal. The greatest part of the elastic and condensed fixed air, will be readily discharged through the tube; and if it be thought necessary, the remainder of it, or the superfluous drink, may be sucked out, by a bellows fixed to the upper end of the tube, with a couple of valves, one at its muzzle, and the other at the side of it, so disposed as to allow the air to pass in the direction from the stomach upwards.\n\nBy means of such a tube, the air is not only more certainly discharged than by stabbing the animal; but the dangers avoided which the stabbing occasions, not so much by the irritation which the wound creates, as that the air, and the other contents of the stomach, getting into the cavity of the belly, between the containing parts and the bowels, excite such a degree of inflammation as frequently proves fatal to the animal. This tube may be also useful for the purpose of introducing stimulant medicines into the stomach, when the contraction at the upper orifice would prevent their being given without some such contrivance.\n\nAn instrument of this kind is sold in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, at Macdougall's, No. 15, Great Wind-Mill Street. It should be made of various sizes, for sheep, as well as cattle. According to Mr Blaine, Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAGLES\">Eagles</a> of Graffham <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a>, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUILDFORD\">Guildford</a>, has simplified this mode of relief much, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of an instrument, for which he was rewarded by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> for the encouragement of Arts, with fifty guineas. This is simply a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANE\">cane</a> of considerable diameter, and five feet in length for oxen; to which is affixed a knob of wood, at the end to be introduced into the stomach. That for sheep is considerably smaller, and three feet long. This instrument, for its simplicity, is much to be preferred, as it is found to occasion the evacuation of the air as effectually as the other. In cases of emergency, and in a judicious hand, the flexible part of a common cart whip might answer the end.\n\nFlatulence may be produced in horses, by eating greedily of rich food, to which they have been unaccustomed, or after having fasted long; especially if they drink much water immediately after. A horse in this state should not be taken out to work, as, from the distention of the stomach, there is danger of injuring the horse's wind, or even in some cases of bursting the stomach. If the distention has not proceeded to a great length, and if the horse is not colicive, gentle friction on the belly, and administering a ball made of some of the cordial seeds, will generally procure relief; but if the complaint proceeds to a great height, and there is gripping pain, attended with coliciveness, it becomes a case of flatulent colic; the descriptions and treatment of which will be considered in the next section.\n\nWhen this flatulence comes to a great height, it affects the disease that is commonly called acute indigestion. It very commonly arises from the horse eating voraciously, after having been kept without food for many hours; especially if the food then given him be of a flatulent kind, such as grains or draft, young sweet grass, clover, or the like. The horse's stomach being naturally small, is easily distended by an unusual quantity of food, or by the air disengaged from such as easily runs into fermentation. Hence arise swelling and tightness of the stomach, and acute pain. The horse discontinues eating,\n\n(D) The use of spirits in these cases was, we believe, first introduced by Dr Whytt of Edinburgh, who was in the habit of administering a pint (mutchkin) of gin on these occasions.\nDiseases eating, holds out his head, and appears exceedingly \ndefrefted; he looks anxiously and mournfully at his \nside, stamps with his feet, and breaks out into cold \nsweat. If he is not soon relieved, the head becomes \naffected, and there appear evident marks of preflure on \nthe brain. Symptoms very similar to those of flaggers \nfollow, and the horse commonly dies apopleptic, or the \nstomach bursts.\n\nAs this affection is so dangerous, immediate relief is \nnecessary. Stimulant medicines, such as are called car-\nminatives, as oil of anifeeds, effence of peppermint, \nor oil of turpentine, should be immediately admini-\nstered; and if there appears much determination of blood \nto the head, which may be known by a swelling and \nheaviness of the eyes, and the violent throbbing of the \n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTERIES\">arteries</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>, it will be necessary to draw \nblood pretty largely by opening one of these arteries. \nIf the horse is bound in the belly, he must be raked, \nand have a strong purgative clyster with some aromatic \nsubstance in it, as anifeeds, or caraway seeds.\n\nAll these animals may occasionally swallow poison, \nand the treatment in these cases must depend in a great \nmeasure on the nature of the poisonous substance, where \nthis can be ascertained. It is seldom that a horse, cow, \nor sheep is poisoned; but in the dog, this may frequently \nhappen, either from accidents, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>. Dogs often \npick up <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUX_VOMICA\">nux vomica</a>, (which is the poison mostly used \nby warreners,) and which usually causes convulsive fits, \nand soon kills. Apply immediately the following reme-\ndy. As much common salt as can be got down; hold \nthe head upwards, and force open the mouth, and by \nfixing a stick across, prevent its shutting, whilst the \nthroat is filled with salt; a sufficient quantity to purge \nand vomit will soon dissolve, and be swallowed; the \nstomach once cleared by a free passage obtained by stool, \nwarm broth should frequently be given to prevent the \nfaintness which might otherwise prove fatal. Two \n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> spoonsfuls of eufor oil, added to the salt, would \nvery much accelerate its action downwards.*\n\nArsenic is frequently given to dogs by design, or it \nmay be picked up by them in places where it has been \nlaid for rats. If the accident is discovered soon, the \ndog may sometimes be recovered by giving him a vomit \nof white vitriol, and drenching him well with \nsweet oil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>; and when most of the poison ap-\npears to have been thrown up, the rest may probably be \nrendered harmless by repeated doses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> of sul-\nphur.\n\nIf a horse is poisoned, the danger is very great, as \nfrom his inability to vomit, the stomach cannot be clear-\ned of the poison. But fortunately this accident scarcely \never happens; as arsenic, the most common poisonous \nsubstance, will produce little effect on the horse, unless \ngiven in a very large dose.\n\nThe stomach and bowels of all these animals may be \ninfected by worms, but they are most common in the \nhorse and dog.\n\nThe worms that most commonly infect the horse are \nwhat are commonly called the bots. They are not pro-\nperly worms, but are the larvae of several species of the \nOefirus or Gadfly mentioned in No. 337.\n\nThe horse is attacked by 2 or 3 species of Oefirus, but \nmore especially by the Oe. equi, which deposits its eggs \nin such a manner as that they shall be received into the \nanimal's stomach, where they form the bots.\n\nThe method pursued by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> fly, in order to \nlay its eggs in the most favourable situation for being \nreceived into the stomach of the horse, is extremely \ncurious. It is thus related by Mr. Bracey Clark, who \nappears to have witnessed the process.\n\n\"When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> has been impregnated, and the \neggs are sufficiently matured, she seeks among the horses' \na subject for her purpose, and approaching it on the \nwing, she holds her body nearly upright in the air, and \nher tail, which is lengthened for the purpose, carried in-\nwards and upwards. In this way she approaches the \npart where she designs to deposit the egg, and suspending \nherself for a few seconds before it, suddenly darts \nupon it, and leaves the egg adhering to the hair, by \nmeans of a glutinous liquor secreted with it. She then \nleaves the horse at a small distance, and prepares a second \negg, and poising herself before the part, deposits it in \nthe same way. The liquor dries, and the egg becomes \nfirmly glued to the hair. This is repeated by various \nflies, till four or five hundred eggs are sometimes de-\nposited on one horse. The skin of the horse is always \nthrown into a tremulous motion on the touch of this \ninsect, arising from the very great irritability of the skin \nand muscles at that season of the year, occasioned by the \ncontinual teasing of the flies. The inside of the knee is \nthe part on which these flies seem to prefer depositing \ntheir eggs, and next to this the side, and back part of \nthe shoulder. It is curious that these parts are what are \nmost exposed to be licked by the animal. In licking, \nthe eggs adhere to the animal's tongue, and are carried \ninto the stomach with the saliva.\n\n\"The bots attach themselves to every part of the \nhorse's stomach, but are usually more numerous about its \nfarther orifice, and are sometimes, though less frequently, \nfound in the bowels. Their number varies considera-\nbly; sometimes there are not above half a dozen; at \nothers they exceed 100. They most usually hang in \nclusters, fixed by the small end to the inner membrane \nof the stomach, to which they adhere by means of two \nsmall hooks.\n\n\"The body of the larva is composed of eleven seg-\nments, all of which, except the two last, are surrounded \nwith a double row of horny bristles, directed towards the \ntruncated end, and are of a reddish colour, except the \n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, which are black. These larvae evidently receive \ntheir food at the small end by a longitudinal aperture \nwhich is situated between the two hooks or tentacula. \nThe lips of this aperture appear somewhat hard, horny, \nand irregular.\n\n\"Their food is probably the chyle, which, being nearly \npure aliment, may go wholly to the composition of \ntheir bodies without any excrementitious residue, though \non dissection the intestine is found to contain a yellow \nor greenish matter, which is derived from the colour of \ntheir food, and shows that the chyle as they receive it is \nnot perfectly pure.\n\n\"The growth of their growth and the purity of their \nfood must occasion, what they receive in a given time \nto be proportionally small; from which probably arises \nthe extreme difficulty there is found in destroying them \nby any medicine or poison thrown into the stomach. \nAfter opium had been administered to a horse labouring \nunder a case of locked jaw for a week, in doses of one \nounce every day, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of the animal I have \nfound the bots in the stomach perfectly alive. Tobacco\nhas been employed in much larger quantities in the same complaint, and has been also longer continued, without destroying them. They are also but rarely affected by the draff purgatives, which bring away in abundance the Tenia and Ascarides.\"\n\nMr Clark does not apprehend they are so very injurious to the horses as is generally conceived. When removed from the stomach a deep impression remains where they adhered, but whether they ever irritate it so as to bring on a fatal spasm of the stomach itself, or of the pylorus, or, by collecting round this passage, prevent the food from entering the intestine, has never been investigated with sufficient accuracy. The ignorant surmise of farriers on opening the stomach after death, and being presented with so singular an appearance as the bots, has without doubt very often occasioned the death to be attributed to these, though it is certain but few horses on our commons can escape them.\n\nInfantiles have occurred of violent inflammation excited in the stomach by the bots. An example of this is related by Mr James Clark. He was once desired by a farrier in the neighbourhood who was indisposed, to visit a horse that had been a patient of his for some days, and report the situation he was in. When Mr Clark entered the stable, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> was giving the horse a drink, which he was afterwards informed was composed of an infusion of linseed, in which was dissolved one ounce of nitre, with honey to sweeten it; and in the last hornful was poured, from a small phial, about half an ounce, or more, of spirits of hartshorn. The horse seemed very uneasy after the drink, he was soon seized with a violent trembling and shaking, a profuse sweat broke out all over his body, and run down his sides, as if water had been poured on him; at the same time his legs and ears were quite cold; he lay down seemingly in great agony; he was soon after convulsed all over, and died in about half an hour from the time the drink was swallowed. Mr Clark obtained leave to take out his stomach where he was, on condition he should sew up the skin afterwards, in order to prevent any bad smell in the stable, till he could be carried off. On inspecting the stomach, the coats of it were found greatly inflamed, and a mortification had taken place on one side, where it appeared of a darker colour, and here there was a small hole, through which a lead probe passed into the cavity of the stomach from the outside; the coats of the stomach were considerably thickened, and of a darkish red colour resembling the liver; at the same time the stomach was considerably distended and full of food: on turning it inside out, an incredible number of bots were found sticking all round the sides and lower part of it, so that it appeared entirely covered with them, sticking as closely to one another as bees in a honeycomb; and so firmly were the heads of these vermin fixed in the coats of the stomach, that endeavouring to pull some of them off when alive, they broke in two, and their heads remained sticking in the coats of the stomach.\n\nThe great irritation produced by such a number of these worms sticking in the coats of the stomach had no doubt occasioned at first an inflammation there, and from its continuance this was tending to a mortification, before the drench was given, and would have occasion-\n\nAnother species of Oeirrus, viz. the Haemorrhoidalis, also produces eggs, which when received into the stomach of the horse become bots. This insect has been termed haemorrhoidalis from the appearance of the bots when coming out of the anus of the horse, when they are very like the swelling produced by the piles or hemorrhoids. It was supposed by Linnaeus and some other naturalists, that this and the last species introduced their eggs into the bowels of the horse, by entering the rectum, mire per anus intrans; but this opinion is now fully refuted.\n\nThe part chosen by this insect for this purpose, is the lips of the horse, which is very distressing to the animal from the excessive titillation it occasions; for he immediately after rubs his mouth against the ground, his fore legs, or sometimes against a tree; or if two are standing together, they often rub themselves against each other. At the sight of this fly, the horse appears much agitated, and moves his head backwards and forwards in the air, to baulk its touch, and prevent its darting on the lips; but the fly, watching for a favourable opportunity, continues to repeat the operation from time to time; till at length finding this mode of defense insufficient, the enraged animal endeavours to avoid it, by galloping away to a distant part of the field. If it still continues to follow and tease him, his last resource is in the water, where the Oeirrus is never observed to follow him.\n\nThe teasing of other flies will sometimes occasion a motion of the head similar to this; but it should not be mistaken for it, as it is fever in any degree so violent, as during the attack of the Oeirrus.\n\nAt other times the Oeirrus gets between the fore legs of the horse while he is grazing, and thus makes its attack on the lower lip; the titillation occasions the horse to stamp violently with his fore feet, against the ground, and often strike with his foot, as aiming a blow at the fly. They also sometimes hide themselves in the grass; and as the horse stoops to graze, they dart on the mouth, or lips, and are always observed to poise themselves a few seconds in the air, while the egg is preparing on the point of the abdomen.\n\nWhen several of these flies are confined in a close place, they have a particularly strong fetid smell; and I have observed both sheep, and horses, when teased by them, to look into the grass, and smell to it very anxiously; and if they by these means discover the fly, they immediately turn aside, and hasten to a distant part of the field.\n\nThe eggs of this species appear of a darker colour than the former, and we are unacquainted with the circumstances attending their passage to the stomach.\n\nThe larvae of the Oeirrus haemorrhoidalis, as well as the former species, appear to have been termed among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, coelus, which seems to have been a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> for any kind of soft imperfect animal, and to have been very analogous, and as extensively applied iii. p. 310, as the word grub is at present in the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>.\n\nThe presence of bots in the horse's stomach and bowels, is not always easily ascertained, as it is certain that great numbers have been found in the stomach after death, without appearing to have produced any unusual symptoms in the animal while alive. When, however, they have collected in any great numbers, or when the animal's stomach is peculiarly irritable, they are attended with the following symptoms. The horse has a dif-\nDiseases.\n\nposition to rub his tail frequently, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> humour or eruption that should make it itchy; he eats heartily, and is yet always lean and out of condition. His coat is rough and flaring, such as we have described it to be in what is called a surfeit. There is also a fleshy paleness of the mouth and tongue, attended with an unwholesome cadaverous smell. The horse appears tucked up in his flanks, which often heave; he turns his head now and then, and strikes his belly with his hind feet. These latter symptoms indeed, as they only indicate griping pains, and often occur in ordinary colic, are not to be relied on, unless accompanied with the former. In cases of worms, it is said that the dung is yellowish, like melted sulphur, or is otherwise discoloured and very offensive. The surfeit mark, however, of the presence of bots is their being voided by the anus, where they are sometimes found sticking.\n\nTreatment.\n\nAs the bots are extremely tenacious of life, it is very difficult to expel them, and where they do not occasion any considerable irritation or other bad symptoms, it will be better to let them alone till they come away spontaneously. But when it is judged necessary to attempt their expulsion, this may be done by administering the sal indus, as directed in No. 60 of the receipts, and after it a strong dose of calomel and aloes.\n\nWe have said the bots are not properly worms; but there are several species of worms that are very frequent in dogs, and are now and then found in the horse. These are the lumbrici, or long round worms; the acariides, or thread worms; and the tenia, or tape-worms.\n\nThe long round worms are seldom met with in these animals; but when they occur in the horse, they produce much uneasiness, and sometimes occasion colic and inflammation of the bowels. It is very difficult to expel these worms, as the only remedies by which this could be properly attempted, such as powdered tin and strong purgatives, cannot with propriety be often given to a horse, as, from the structure of his stomach, the former might produce considerable injury, and the latter are extremely debilitating.\n\nAcariides are now and then found in the great guts of the horse, and sometimes prove troublesome, but are seldom or never dangerous. They are best removed by clysters of lime-water, followed by purgative clysters.\n\nThe tape-worm is seldom found but in dogs, where they are sometimes the cause of fatal diseases, especially to puppies. The symptoms of worms in dogs are, an itchiness of the nose and at the anus, both of which they are perpetually rubbing against every thing; swelling and hardness of the belly, lameness, running at the eyes and nose, and frequent purging of a slimy or stringy matter. There is also a peculiar staring appearance of the hair, which points the wrong way.\n\nMr Blaine says that the bowels of dogs are so irritable, that they will seldom bear strong physic, and that he knows of nothing that will certainly destroy the worms in their intestines. He has tried with various success, tin, quicksilver, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEWTER\">pewter</a>, calomel, and saffron, with other substances, but none of them appeared sufficiently certain to demand his confidence. When the worms are early detected, he thinks that purging doses of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> powder of scammony with calomel, prove the most efficacious means. Mr Daniel recommends aloes, hartshorn, the juice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WORMWOOD\">wormwood</a>, with some flower of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISMUTH\">bismuth</a>, mixed together into a ball, about the size of a hazel nut, which is to be wrapped up in butter, and given three or four times a week, letting the dog fast for a few hours each time, which, he says, will destroy the worms. He also says that they may be destroyed by giving the dog as much finely powdered white glass as will lie on a sixpence, for three successive mornings, mixed up with butter; and if the worms are not voided in that time, the dose of the glass is to be increased, and it is to be repeated for three other mornings, by which time it will scarcely fail of producing the desired effect.\n\nThere is a sort of concretion often met with in the stomachs of cattle, and sometimes in that of horses, which is partly composed of a chalky substance, and partly, or sometimes almost entirely, of hair evidently arising from the animal's licking off their hair and swallowing it with their saliva. The mass thus received into the stomach, being wholly indigestible, collects there, and forms these globular concretions which sometimes grow to such a size as to prove fatal.\n\nThe growth of these concretions is thought to be encouraged by the long use of hard dry food, without the animal's being allowed to feed from time to time on fresh green herbage. It is even thought that the timely use of fresh grass may prove the means of dissolving these concretions. Van Swieten, in his commentaries on Boerhaave, when speaking of chalky matters found in the liver and other organs, remarks, that sometimes there are concretions of the like sort found in this organ, but of a more friable texture, and of a whiter appearance, like gypsum or plaster of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>. Such incrustations were often observed by Glisson in the pori biliarii, and its larger branches dispersed through the livers of oxen that had been fed in stalls with hay and straw during the winter season and without exercise. But these concretions are very friable, and they afterwards dissolve again, and pass out of the body when the cattle come to feed upon the fresh grass of the meadows; for in oxen that are slain in the spring or summer, they are very rarely to be found.\n\n\"In defective horses, (says Mr Clark) I have frequently met with chalky concretions in their livers and in the lungs, especially in those that have been fed long on dry food, and likewise round balls in their stomachs, sometimes of an oval shape. The latter seem for the most part to be composed of the dust they lick from their own bodies mixed with the hair. Whether the fresh grass dissolves them is not so certain; but that it causes these concretions to pass through the intestines, I have had a full demonstration. In May 1786, a horse that had been long fed on dry food was turned out to grass; in about eight or ten days afterwards, he was seized with violent griping pains, which lasted for about 24 hours, when he died. As the horse was very fat, the man who had the charge of him wanted to make something of his grease. In searching for it, he observed a large space of the intestines of a very black colour; and on feeling it, found something hard and weighty within them. He immediately cut it open with his knife, and took out a large oval hard ball, which measured four inches in length, and three inches and a half in breadth, and which I have now in my possession. That this concretion was originally formed in the stomach,\nDiseases of the stomach, there can be no doubt, as they frequently upon digestion have been found there, and nothing but its great bulk had hindered it from passing through the intestines.","sp":83,"ep":118},{"h":"FARWELL-CAPE","t":"the most southerly promontory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENLAND\">Greenland</a>, in W. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">Long</a>. 50\u00b0, and N.

Some divines even pretend its origin was in the earthly paradise, where our first parents were forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge. But though this seems carrying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> too far, it is certain that the Jewish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> has observed fasts ever since its first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a>. Nor were the neighbouring heathens, viz. the Egyptians, Phoenicians, and Assyrians, without their fasts. The Egyptians, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a>, sacrificed a cow to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISIS\">Isis</a>, after having prepared themselves by fasting and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a>; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> which he likewise attributes to the women of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYRENE\">Cyrene</a>. Porphyry affirms, that the Egyptians, before their stated sacrifices, always fasted a great many days, sometimes for six weeks; and that the least behoved to be for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> days: during all which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the priests and devotees not only abstained from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, fish, wine, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>; but even from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, and some kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a>. These austerities were communicated by them to the Greeks, who observed their fasts much in the same manner. The Athenians had the Eleusinian and Thesmophorian fasts, the observation of which was very rigorous, especially among the women, who spent one whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> sitting on the ground in a mournful dress, without taking any nourishment. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRETE\">Crete</a>, the priests of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> were obliged to abstain all their lives from fish, flesh, and baked meats. Apuleius informs us, that whoever had a mind to be initiated in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of Cybele were obliged to prepare themselves by fasting ten days; and, in short, all the pagan deities, whether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a>, required this duty of those that desired to be initiated into their mysteries, of their priests and priestesses that gave the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORACLES\">oracles</a>, and of those who came to consult them.\n\nAmong the heathens fasting was also practised before some of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> enterprises. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> informs us, that the Lacedemonians having resolved to succour a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of the allies, ordained a fast throughout the\nthe whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of their dominions, without excepting even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> animals: and this they did for two ends: one to spare <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> in favour of the besieged; the other to draw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the blessing of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> upon their enterprise. The inhabitants of Tarentum, when besieged by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, demanded succours from their neighbours of Rhegium, who immediately commanded a fast throughout their whole territories. Their enterprise having had good success by their throwing a supply of provisions into the town, the Romans were obliged to raise the siege; and the Tarentines, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of this deliverance, instituted a perpetual fast.\n\nFasting has always been reckoned a particular duty among philosophers and religious people, some of whom have carried their abstinence to an incredible length. At Rome it was practised by kings and emperors themselves. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMA_POMPILIUS\">Numa Pompilius</a>, Julius Caesar, Augustus, Vespasian, and others, we are told, had their stated fast days: and Julian the Apostate was so exact in this observance as to outdo the priests themselves, and even the most rigid philosophers. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGOREANS\">Pythagoreans</a> kept a continual fast; but with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>, that they believed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of fish to be equally unlawful with that of flesh. Besides their constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a>, they also frequently fasted rigidly for a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time. In this respect, however, they were all outdone by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a>, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> his fasts for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less than 40 days together. Even Apollonius Tyaneus, one of his most famous disciples, could never come up to him in the length of his fasts, though they greatly exceeded those of the ordinary Pythagoreans. The Gymnosophists, or Brahmans of the east, are also very remarkable for their severe fastings; and the Chinese, according to Father Le Comte, have also their stated fasts, with forms of prayer for preserving them from barrenness, inundations, earthquakes, &c. The Mahometans too, who possess so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, are very remarkable for the strict observance of their fasts; and the exactness of their dervishes in this respect is extraordinary.\n\nFasting was often used by the heathens for superstitious purposes; sometimes to procure the interpretations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a>; at others, to be an antidote against their pernicious consequences. A piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> prevails to this day among the Jews; who, though expressly forbidden to fast on Sabbath-days, think themselves at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to dispense with this duty when they happen to have fruitful and unlucky dreams the night preceding, that threatened them with great misfortunes. On these occasions they observe a formal fast the whole day; and at night the patient, having invited three of his friends, addresses himself to them seven times in a very solemn manner, saying, \"May the dream I have had prove a lucky one!\" And his friends answer as many times, \"Amen, may it be lucky, and God make it so!\" After which, in order to encourage him, they conclude the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> with these words of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTES\">Ecclesiastes</a>, \"Go eat thy bread with joy;\" and then sit themselves down to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>. They have also added several fasts not commanded in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of Moses, particularly three, in memory of sore distresses their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> has suffered at different times. The abstinence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Jews <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> lasted 27 or 28 hours at a time; beginning before sunset, and not ending till some hours after sunset next day. On these days they were obliged to wear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> robes in token of grief and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPENTANCE\">repentance</a>; to cover themselves with sackcloth, or their worst clothes; to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> on ashes; to sprinkle them on their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, &c. Some spent the whole night and day following in the temple or synagogue, in prayers and other devotions, barefooted, with a scourge in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, of which they sometimes made a good use in order to raise their zeal. Lastly, in order to complete their abstinence, at night they were to eat nothing but a little bread dipped in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> for seasoning; except they chose to add to their repast some bitter herbs and pulse.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, both Jews and Pagans, had also their fasts for purifying the body, particularly the priests and such as were any way employed at the altars; for when nocturnal disorders happened to these, it was unlawful for them to approach all the next day, which they were bound to employ in purifying themselves. On this account, at great festivals, where their ministry could not be dispensed with, it was usual for them, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVE\">eve</a> thereof, not only to fast, but also to abstain from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, for the greater certainty. For this purpose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> had under officers to wake him, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> overtaken with sleep; against which other preservatives were also made use of.","sp":190,"ep":191},{"h":"FASTERMANS","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> FASTING-MEN, q. d. homines habentes, was used in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> customs for men in repute and substance; or rather for pledges, sureties, or bondsmen, who, according to the Saxon polity, were fast bound to answer for one another's peaceable behaviour.","sp":191,"ep":191},{"h":"FASTI","t":"in Roman antiquity, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALENDAR\">calendar</a> wherein were expressed the several days of the year, with their feasts, games, and other ceremonies.\n\nThere were two sorts of fasti, the greater and lesser: the former being distinguished by the appellation fasti magistrales, and the latter by that of fasti calendares.\n\n1. The fasti calendares, which were properly and primarily called fasti, are defined by Feftus Pompeius to be books containing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the whole year: i.e. ephemerides, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> diaries, distinguishing the several kinds of days, fasti, profasti; fasti, nefasti, &c. The author of these was Numa, who committed the care and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the fasti to the pontifex maximus, whom the people used to consult on every occasion. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> held till the year of Rome 459, when C. Flavius, secretary to the pontifices, exposed in the forum a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of all the days on which it was lawful to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>; which was so acceptable to the people, that they made him curule edile.\n\nThese lesser fasti, or fasti calendares, were of two kinds, urbani and rustic.\n\nThe fasti urbani, or fasti of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, were those which obtained or were observed in the city. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> have them thus called, because they were exposed publicly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> parts of the city; though by the various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSCRIPTIONS\">inscriptions</a> or gravings thereof on antique <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, one would imagine that private persons had them likewise in their houses. Ovid undertook to illustrate these fasti urbani, and comment on them, in his Libri Fastorum.\nFas, Faflorum, whereof we have the first six books still remaining; the last six, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> ever they were written, being lost.\n\nIn the fafla rusticis, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> fasti, were expressed the several days, feasts, &c., to be observed by the country people: for as these were taken up in tilling the ground, fewer feasts, sacrifices, ceremonies, and holidays, were enjoined them than the inhabitants of cities; and they had also some peculiar ones not observed at Rome. These rustic fasti contained little more than the ceremonies of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KALENDS\">kalends</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NONES\">nones</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDES\">ides</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAIRS\">fairs</a>, signs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZODIAC\">zodiac</a>, incense and decrease of the days, the tutelary gods of each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, and certain directions for rural works to be performed each month.\n\n2. In the greater fasti, or fasti magistrates, were expressed the several feasts, with every thing relating to the gods, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, and the magistrates; the emperors, their birth-days, offices, days consecrated to them, and feasts and ceremonies established in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>, or for their prosperity, &c. With a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of such circumstances did flattery at length swell the fasti; when they became denominated Magni, to distinguish them from the bare calendar, or fasti kalendares.\n\nFasti was also a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRONICLE\">chronicle</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, where-in the several years were denoted by the respective consuls, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> events that happened during their consulates; these were called also fasti consulares, or consular fasti.\n\nFasti, or Dies Fasti, also denoted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> days. The word fasti faflorum, is formed of the verb fari, \"to speak,\" because during those days the courts were opened, causes might be heard, and the praetor was allowed fari, to pronounce the three words, do, dico, addico: The other days wherein this was prohibited were called nefasti: thus Ovid,\n\nIlle nefastus erit, per quem tria verba silentur:\nFastus erit, per quem lege licet agi.\n\nThese dieti fasti were noted in the calendar by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> F: but observe, that there were some days ex parte fasti, partly fasti, partly nefasti; i.e., <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> might be distributed at certain times of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and not at others. These days were called intercali, and were marked in the calendar thus; F. P. faflor primo, where justice might be demanded during the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of that day.\n\nFasting, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a> from food. See Fast.\n\nMany wonderful stories have been told of extraordinary fasting; great numbers of which undoubtedly must be false. Others, however, we have on very good authority, of which some are mentioned under the article Abstinence. Another we have in the\n\nFasting Woman. A full account of this very uncommon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is given in the Phil. Trans. Vol. LXVII. Part I. the substance of which follows: The woman, whose name was Janet McLeod, an inhabitant of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINCARDINE\">Kincardine</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROSS_SHIRE\">Ross-shire</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> healthy till she was 15 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, when she had a pretty severe epileptic fit; after this she had an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> for four years, and then another epileptic fit which continued a whole day and a night. A few days afterwards she was seized with a fever, which continued with violence several weeks, and from which she did not perfectly recover for some months. At this fasting time she lost the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of her eyelids; so that she was under a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of keeping them open with the fingers of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, whenever she wanted to look about her. In other respects she continued in pretty good health; only she never had any appearance of menes, but periodically spit up blood in pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> quantities, and at the same time it flowed from the nose. This discharge continued several years; but at last it ceased: and soon after she had a third epileptic fit, and after that a fever from which she recovered very slowly. Six weeks after the crisis, she stole out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> unknown to her parents, who were buried in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> work, and bound the sheaves of a ridge before she was observed. In the evening she took to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, complaining much of her heart (most probably her stomach, according to the phraseology of that country) and her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. From that time she never rose for five years, but was occasionally lifted out of bed. She seldom spoke a word, and took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> little food that it seemed scarce sufficient to support a sucking infant. Even this small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> was taken by compulsion; and at last, about Whitunday 1763, she totally refused every kind of food or drink. Her jaw now became so fast locked, that it was with the greatest difficulty her father was able to open her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> a little, in order to admit a small quantity of gruel or whey; but of this so much generally run out at the corners of her mouth, that they could not be sensible any had been swallowed. About this time they got some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> from a noted medicinal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> in Brae-Mar, some of which they attempted to make her swallow, but without effect. They continued their trials, however, for three mornings; rubbing her throat with the water, which run out at the corners of her mouth. On the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> during the operation, she cried out, \"Give me more water;\" and swallowed with ease all that remained in the bottle. She spoke no more intelligibly for a year; though she continued to mutter some words, which her parents only understood, for 14 days. She continued to reject all kinds of food and drink till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1765. At this time her father thought, by some figs he made, that she wanted her jaws opened; and this being done, not without violence, she called intelligibly for a drink, and drank with ease about an English pint of water. Her father then asked her why she would not make some signs when she wanted a drink? to which she answered, why should she when she had no desire. It was now supposed that she had regained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of speech; and her jaws were kept open for about three weeks by means of a wedge. But in four or five days she became totally silent, and the wedge was removed because it made her lips sore. She still, however, continued sensible; and when her eyelids were opened, knew everybody, as could be guessed from the signs she made.\n\nBy continuing their attempts to force open her jaws, two of the under foreteeth were driven out; and of this opening her parents endeavoured to avail themselves by putting some thin nourishing drink into her mouth; but without effect, as it always returned by the corners. Sometimes they thought of thrusting a little dough of oatmeal through this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAP\">gap</a> of the teeth, which she would retain a few seconds, and then return with something like a straining to vomit, without one particle\nFasting. ticle going <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>. Nor were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> sensible of anything like swallowing for four years, excepting the small draught of Brae-Mar water and the English pint of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> water. For the last three years she had not any evacuation by stool or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>, except that once or twice a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> she passed a few drops of urine, about as much, to use the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of her parents, as would wet the surface of a halfpenny. In this situation she was visited by Dr Mackenzie, who communicated the account of her case to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>. He found her not at all emaciated; her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a> were bent, and the hamstring tight, so that her heels almost touched her buttocks. She slept much, and was very quiet; but when awake, kept a constant whimpering like a newborn weakly infant. She never could remain a moment on her back, but always fell to one side or another; and her chin was clasped <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, nor could it by any force be moved backwards.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> paid his first visit in the month of October; and five years afterwards, viz. in October 1772, was induced to pay her a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> visit, by hearing that she was recovering, and had begun to eat and drink. The account given him was most extraordinary. Her parents one day returning from their country labours (having left their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> fixed to her bed as usual), were greatly surprised to find her sitting upon her hams, on the side of the house opposite to her bed-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINNING\">spinning</a> with her mother's distaff. All the food she took at that time was only to crumble a little oat or barley cake in the palm of her hand, as if to feed a chicken. She put little crumbs of this into the gap of her teeth; rolled them about for some time in her mouth; and then sucked out of the palm of her hand a little water, whey, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>; and this only once or twice a-day, and even that by compulsion. She never attempted to speak; her jaws were fast locked, and her eyes shut. On opening her eyelids, the balls were found to be turned up under the edge of the os frontis; her countenance was ghastly, her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a>, and her whole person emaciated. She seemed feeble, and tractable in every thing except in taking food. This she did with the utmost reluctance, and even cried before she yielded. The great change of her looks Dr Mackenzie attributed to her spinning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a> on the distaff, which exhausted too much of the saliva; and therefore he recommended to her parents to confine her totally to the spinning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>. In 1775, she was visited again, and found to be greatly improved in her looks as well as strength; her food was also considerably increased in quantity; though even then she did not take more than would be sufficient to sustain an infant of two years of age.\n\nThe following remarkable instances of animals being able to live <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> without food, are related by Sir William <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a> in his account of the late earthquakes in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> (Phil. Transf. vol. lxxiii). \"At Soriano (says he), two fattened hogs that had remained buried under a heap of ruins, were taken out alive the 42d day; they were lean and weak, but soon recovered.\" Again, \"At Messina two mules belonging to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> de Belvil remained under a heap of ruins, one of them 22 days, and the other 23 days; they would not eat for some days, but drank water plentifully, and are now recovered. There are numberless instances of dogs remaining many days in the same situation; and a hen belonging to the British vice-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a> at Messina, that had been closely shut up under the ruins of his house, was taken out the 22d day, and is now recovered; it did not eat for some days, but drank freely; it was emaciated, and showed little signs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> at first. From these instances, and those related before of the hogs at Soriano, and several others of the same kind that have been related to me, but which being less remarkable I omit, one may conclude, that long fasting is always attended with great thirst and total loss of appetite.\"\n\nAn instance of a similar kind, not less remarkable than either of the two preceding, we find in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">Gentleman</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1785, communicated by a correspondent, as follows: \"During the heavy snow which fell in the night of the 7th of January 1779, a parcel of sheep belonging to Mr John Wolley, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATLOCK\">Matlock</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DERBYSHIRE\">Derbyshire</a>, which were pastured on that part of the East Moor that lies within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANOR\">manor</a> of Matlock, were covered with the drifted snow: in the course of a day or two all the sheep that were covered with the snow were found again, except two, which were consequently given up as lost; but on the 14th of February following (some time after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> of the snow in the valleys, and 38 days after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>), as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> was walking over a large parcel of drifted snow which remained on the declivity of a hill, a dog he had with him discovered one of the two sheep that had been lost, by winding (or scenting) it through a small aperture which the breath of the sheep had made in the snow; the servant thereupon dug away the snow, and released the captive from its prison; it immediately ran to a neighbouring spring, at which it drank for a considerable time, and afterwards rejoined its old companions as though no such accident had befallen it. On inspecting the place where it was found, it appeared to have stood between two large stones which lay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> with each other at about two feet and a half distance, and probably were the means of protecting it from the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of the snow, which, in that place lay several yards thick: from the number of stones around it, it did not appear that the sheep had been able to pick up any food during its confinement. Soon afterwards its owner removed it to some low lands; but as it had nearly lost its appetite, it was fed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> and milk for some time: in about a fortnight after its enlargement it lost its sight and wool; but in a few weeks afterwards they both returned again, and in the course of the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> it was quite recovered.

It is surprising how soon some birds grow fat; ortolans, it is said, in 24 hours, and larks still sooner.\n\nFats may be divided, from their consistence, into three kinds: (1.) The soft and thin, which grow perfectly liquid in a very small heat; (2.) The thick and consistent, which liquefy less readily; and, (3.) The hard and firm, which require a still stronger heat to melt them.

This is certain, that the greater the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of aliments taken by healthy animals, above what is necessary for their nourishment and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-REPRODUCTION\">reproduction</a>, the fatter they become. Hence animals which are castrated, which are not much exercised, or which are come to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> when the loss and production of the seminal fluid is less, and which at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> consume much succulent aliment, generally become fatter, and sometimes exceedingly so.\n\nAlthough fat be very different from truly animalized substances, and appears not easily convertible into nutritive juices, it being generally difficult of digestion, and apt to become rancid, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> does in the stomachs of many persons; yet in certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> it serves to the nourishment and reparation of the body. Animals certainly become lean, and live upon their fat, when they have too little food, and when they have diseases which prevent digestion and the production of the nutritive juice; and in these cases the fatter animals hold out longer than the leaner. The fat appears to be then absorbed by the vessels designed for this use, and to be transformed into nutritive juice.\n\nFat, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, signifies the same with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>.

They inform us that it is seen in the straits of Messina, and sometimes denominated the castles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAIRY\">Fairy</a> Morgana. The accounts of this phenomenon differ considerably from each other, and travellers are not unanimous as to the causes which are necessary for its production. It would perhaps be difficult to determine how far the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> of those who have spoken of it may be considered capable of producing astonishment, yet the actual existence of such a phenomenon admits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> dispute.\n\nThe first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of Minasi, in his Dissertation on the Fata Morgana, speaks of this phenomenon in the following manner. When the rising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> thins from that point whence its incident ray forms an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of 45\u00b0 on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGGIO\">Reggio</a>, and the bright surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> is not disturbed either by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> or the current, the spectator being placed on an eminence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, with his back to the sun and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> to the sea; on a sudden there appear in the water, as in a catoptric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>, various multiplied objects, that is to say, numberless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of pilasters, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>, castles well delineated, regular columns, lofty towers, superb palaces, with balconies and windows, extended alleys of trees, delightful plains with herbs and flocks, armies of men on foot and horseback, and many other strange images, in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> colours and proper actions, passing rapidly in succession along the surface of the sea during the whole of the short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> while the above-mentioned causes remain.\n\n\"But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a>, in addition to the circumstances before described, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> be highly impregnated with vapour and dense exhalations, not previously dispersed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the wind or waves, or rarefied by the sun, it...\"\nit then happens that in this vapour, as in a curtain extended along the channel to the height of about 30 palms, and nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the sea, the observer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> behold the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of the same objects not only reflected from the surface of the sea, but likewise in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, though not so distinct or well defined as the former objects from the sea.\n\n\"If the air be slightly hazy and opake, and at the same time dewy and adapted to form the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRIS\">iris</a>, then the above-mentioned objects will appear only at the surface of the sea, as in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, but all vividly coloured, or fringed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, green, blue, and other prismatic colours.\"\n\nFrom this account of Minasi it appears, that there are three different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of Fata Morgana; the first appearing at the surface of the sea, denominated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">Marine</a> Morgana; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> in the air, called the Aerial Morgana, and the third only at the surface of the sea, or Morgana fringed with prismatic colours. The same ingenious author attempted to trace the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a> of the word Morgana, which he thinks is derived from \u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c2, \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b3\u03cd\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2, and \u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c3, \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c6\u03af\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2. This splendid sight affects all descriptions of men with such joy, that they run towards the sea, exclaiming Morgana, Morgana! This etymology of Minasi may seem at first view to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> in terms; but it will appear most natural, when we consider the joy which the Morgana inspires, and the corresponding sorrow or dejection which must be felt when it vanishes away. Our author informs us, that he beheld this magnificent appearance three times, and would rather behold it again than the \"most superb theatrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> in the world.\"\n\nIn his physical and astronomical remarks on this phenomenon, he observes that the sea in the straits of Messina exhibits the appearance of a large inclined speculum; that, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> current or tide which flows and returns in the straits for six hours each way, and is constantly attended by an opposite current along shore to the medium distance of about half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a>, there are many eddies and irregularities at the time of the change of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>; and that the Morgana usually appears at this period. He describes the effects produced by it to the supposed inclination of the surface of the sea, and its subdivision into different planes by the contrary eddies. The effects produced in the air he considers as the result of saline and other effluvia suspended in the air. These appearances are produced by a calm sea, and one or more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> of superincumbent air differing in refractive, and consequently in reflective power, rather than from any considerable change in the surface of the water, with the laws of which we are much better acquainted than with those of the atmosphere.\n\nTo the above account we shall add the following, given by M. Houel, whose judgment and veracity render his authority highly respectable. \"In fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> days, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> is calm, there rises above the great current a vapour, which acquires a certain density, so as to form in the atmosphere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> prisms, whose sides are disposed in such a manner, that when they come to their proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of perfection, they reflect and represent successively, for some time (like a moveable mirror), the objects on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> or in the adjacent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. They exhibit by turns the city and suburbs of Messina, trees, animals, men, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>. They are certainly beautiful aerial moving pictures. There are sometimes two or three prisms, equally perfect; and they continue in this state eight or ten minutes. After this, some shining inequalities are observed upon the surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRISM\">prism</a>, which render confused to the eye the objects which had been before so accurately delineated, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> vanishes. The vapour forms other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a>, and is dispersed in air. Different accounts have been given of this singular appearance; which for my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> to a bitumen that issues from certain rocks at the bottom of the sea, and which is often seen to cover a part of its surface in the strait of Messina. The subtile parts of the bitumen being attenuated, combined, and exhaled with the aqueous globules that are raised by the air, and formed into bodies of vapour, give to this condensed vapour more consistence; and contribute, by their smooth and polished particles, to the formation of a kind of aerial crystal, which receives the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, reflects it to the eye, and transmits to it all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> the objects exhibited in this phenomenon, and render them visible.\"","sp":194,"ep":195},{"h":"FATE","t":"denotes an inevitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> depending upon a superior cause.

He married about the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> Miss Purrier of Leeds. In April 1774, by the late Dr Plumptree's favour, he exchanged his vicarage for the rectory of Hayes.

The Chinese have two solemn feasts in the year, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUCIUS\">Confucius</a>, besides others of less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> on the other days of the year.\n\nFeasts among us are either immovable or moveable.\n\nImmovable Feasts are those constantly celebrated on the same day of the year; the principal of these are Christmas day or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATIVITY\">Nativity</a>, the Circumcision, Epiphany, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLEMAS\">Candlemas</a> or the Purification, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a> Day or the Annunciation, called also the Incarnation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">Conception</a>, All Saints and All Souls; besides the days of the several Apostles, St Thomas, St Paul, &c. which with us are feasts, though not feriae. See each feast under its proper article.\n\nMoveable Feasts are those which are not confined to the same day of the year. Of these the principal is Easter, which gives <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> to all the rest, all of them following, and keeping their proper distances from it; such are Palm-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-GOOD_FRIDAY\">Good-Friday</a>, Ash-Wednesday, Sexagesima, Ascension Day, Pentecost, and Trinity-Sunday. See Easter, Sexagesima, Pentecost, Trinity, &c.\n\nThe four feasts which the English laws take special notice of are, the Annunciation of the blessed Virgin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> or Lady Day, the 25th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>; the nativity of St John the Baptist, held on the 24th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>; the Feast of St Michael the Archangel, on the 29th of September; and that of St Thomas the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">Apostle</a>, on the 21st of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>: on which quarterly days rent on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a> is usually referred to be paid (5 and 6 Edw. VI. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 3. 3 Jac. I. cap. 1. 12 Car. II. cap. 30.)\n\nBesides these feasts which are general, and enjoined by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, there are others local and occasional, enjoined by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>, or voluntarily set on foot by the people; such are the days of thanksgiving for deliverance from wars, plagues, &c. Such also are the vigils or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAKES\">wakes</a> in commemoration of the dedications of particular churches. See Vigil, &c.\n\nThe prodigious increase of feast days in the Christian church commenced towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the fourth century, and was occasioned by the discovery that was then made of the remains of martyrs and other holy men, for the commemoration of whom they were established. These, instead of being let apart for pious exercises, were abused in indolence, voluptuousness, and criminal practices. Many of them were instituted on a pagan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a>, and perverted to similar purposes.\n\nFeast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">Death</a>, or Feast of Souls, a solemn religious ceremony in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> among the savages of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>; some of whom thus testify their respect for the deceased every eight years; and others, as the Hurons and Iroquois, every ten years.\n\nThe day of this ceremony is appointed by public order; and nothing is omitted, that it may be celebrated with the utmost pomp and magnificence. The neighbouring tribes are invited to be present, and to join in the solemnity. At this time all who have died since the last solemn occasion are taken out of their graves; those who have been interred at the greatest distance from the villages are diligently sought for, and brought to this great rendezvous of carcases.\n\nIt is not difficult to conceive the horror of this general disinterment; but it cannot be described in a more lively manner than it is done by Lafitau, to whom we are indebted for the most authentic account of those nations.\n\n\"Without question (says he), the opening of these tombs displays one of the most striking scenes that can be conceived; this humbling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> misery, in so many images of death, wherein the seems to take a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> to paint herself in a thousand various shapes of horror, in the several carcases, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> in which corruption has prevailed over them, or the manner in which it has attacked them. Some appear dry and withered; others have a fort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARCHMENT\">parchment</a> upon their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>; some look as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they were baked and smoked, without any appearance of rottenness; some are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> towards the point of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>; whilst others are all swarming with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>, and drowned in corruption. I know not which ought to strike us most, the horror of so shocking a sight, or the tender <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and affection of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> people toward their departed friends: for nothing deserves our admiration more than that eager diligence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> with which they discharge this melancholy duty of their tenderness; gathering up carefully even the smallest bones, handling the carcases, distrustful as they are, with everything loathsome, cleansing them from the worms, and carrying them upon their shoulders through tireless journeys of several days, without being discouraged from the offensiveness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, and without suffering any other emotions to arise than those of regret, for having lost persons who were so dear to them in their lives, and so lamented in their death.\n\n\"They bring them into their cottages, where they prepare a feast in honour of the dead; during which their great actions are celebrated, and all the tender intercourses which took place between them and their friends are piously called to mind. The strangers, who have come sometimes many hundred miles to be present on the occasion, join in the tender condolence; and the women, by frightful shrieks, demonstrate that they are pierced with the sharpest sorrow. Then the dead bodies are carried from the cabins for the general re-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERMENT\">interment</a>. A great pit is dug in the ground, and thither,\nthither, at a certain time, each person attended by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> and friends, marches in solemn silence, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the dead body of a son, a father, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>. When they are all convened, the dead bodies, or the dust of those which were quite corrupted, are deposited in the pit: then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a> of grief breaks out anew. Whatever they possess most valuable is interred with the dead. The strangers are not wanting in their generosity, and confer these presents which they have brought along with them for the purpose. Then all present go <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> into the pit, and every one takes a little of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, which they afterwards preserve with the most religious care. The bodies, ranged in order, are covered with entire new furs, and over these with bark, on which they throw flones, wood, and earth. Then taking their last farewell, they return each to his own cabin.\n\n\"We have mentioned, that in this ceremony the savages offer, as presents to the dead, whatever they value most highly. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> among them, arises from a rude notion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>. They believe this doctrine most firmly, and it is the principal tenet of their religion. When the soul is separated from the body of their friends, they conceive that it still continues to hover around it, and require and take delight in the same things with which it formerly was pleased. After a certain time, however, it forsakes this dreary mansion, and departs far westward into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> of spirits. They have even gone so far as to make a distinction between the inhabitants of the other world; some, they imagine, particularly those who in their lifetime have been fortunate in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, possess a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>, have a place for hunting and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a>, which never fails, and enjoy all sensual delights, without labouring hard, in order to procure them. The souls of those, on the contrary, who happen to be conquered or slain in war, are extremely miserable after death.\"\n\nFeast is also used for a banquet, or a sumptuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>, without any immediate view to religion.\n\nThe use of the word, in this sense, arises hence; that a part of the ceremony of many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> festivals, both of the heathens and agape of the Christians, was good eating; though Mr Huet chooses to derive the word from festinare, which, in an ancient Latin version of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGEN\">Origen</a>'s Comment on Matthew, signifies \"to feast.\" Ut veniens illuc <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> festinat cum discipulis suis.\n\nSocial or civil feasts were also expressed by the words convivium and compositio or concenatio. Cicero says, that in the Roman tongue, the word convivium, which means \"people assembled at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>,\" is more significant than the Greek word compotatio or concenatio: the Roman, says he, expresses the conjunction of body and mind which ought to take place at an entertainment; the Greek denotes what relates to the body alone.\n\nAs food is necessary to our existence, it makes a bond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> among mankind. People at a feast, says one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, seem to form but one body, one soul. All nations, whether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> or civilized, have regarded the pleasure of the table as the occasion of the most agreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of enjoyment (abstracting from its susceptibility of abuse) makes but one family of all that it brings together. It levels the distinctions introduced by policy or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>, and disposes men to regard one another as brethren. It is here that people feel the equality established by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; here they forget the evils of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; they extinguish their hatred, and make their enmities cease. For this reason <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> considers as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> of the social principle that custom of the Egyptians of eating apart, and praises the convivial repasts established by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOS\">Minos</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LYCURGUS\">Lycurgus</a>.\n\nThe Persians generally deliberated on business at table, but never determined or put their determinations in execution except in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> before having eaten.\n\nWhen the Germans, says Tacitus, wanted to reconcile enemies, to make alliances, to name chiefs, or to treat of war and peace, it was during the repast that they took counsel; a time in which the mind is most open to the impressions of simple truths, or most easily animated to great attempts. These artful people during the conviviality of the feast spoke without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a>. Next day they weighed the counsels of the former evening; they deliberated at a time when they were not disposed to feign, and took their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> when they were least liable to be deceived.\n\nPeople of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> among the Rhodians, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> law of the state, were obliged to dine daily with those who had the management of affairs, in order to deliberate with them concerning such things as were necessary or useful for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; and on this account the principal ministers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> were obliged to keep open table for all who could be of use to the state.\n\nAmong the Romans, the place where they supped was generally the vestibule, that a more retired part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> might not encourage licentiousness and disorder. There were several laws that restricted their meals to those vestibules.\n\nWhen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> reigned in Rome, they had superb halls for their entertainments. Lucullus had many, each of which bore the name of some deity; and this name was a mark which indicated to the servants the expense of the entertainment. The expense of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a> in Lucullus's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a> amounted to 50,000 drachmas.\n\nThe hall in which Nero feasted, by the circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of its walls and ceiling, imitated the revolutions of the heavens, and represented the different seasons of the year, changing at every course, and showering down <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> and perfumes on the guests.\n\nThe Romans did not, as we do, use but one table at their feasts; they had generally two; the first was for the services of animal food, which was afterwards removed, and another introduced with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>; at this last they sung and poured out their libations. The Greeks and eastern nations had the same custom, and even the Jews in their solemn feasts and at sacrifices.\n\nThe Romans, in the time of Nero, had tables made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CITRON\">citron</a> wood brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAURITANIA\">Mauritania</a>; they were varnished with purple and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, and were raised on feet of carved ivory. It is said that they were more precious than gold. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DION\">Dion</a> Cassius affirms, that Seneca had 500 of these, which he made use of one after another; and Tertullian tells us that Cicero had but one. The Romans chose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of the feast by a throw of the dice.\nWe learn from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a>, that the ancients had neither cups nor bowls, but that they drank out of little horns-tipt with silver or gold.\n\nUnder the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. of France, the custom of placing the lights upon the table was not yet introduced. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of domestics held the candles in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> during the whole time of the repast.\n\nThe Greeks and Romans kept a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> for the purpose of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> during their meals and feasts. Sometimes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of the family himself performed the office of reader; and history informs us, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Severus often read while his family ate. The time of reading was generally at supper; and guests were invited to a reading as they are now a-days to play <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDS\">cards</a>.\n\nThe Greeks, in their flourishing times, did not profane, according to their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a> of the table; but rather adorned it with ingenious and elegant conversation; they proposed moral topics, of which Plutarch has preserved a collection.\n\nAncient philosophers remark, that heroes rarely assembled convivially without bringing affairs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> into discourse, or deliberating upon those that regarded either present events or future contingencies.\n\nThe Scythians, while at meat, used to make the strings of their bows resound, lest their warlike virtues might be enfeebled or lost in this season of pleasure.\n\nWhen Rome was corrupted with luxury, fingers, dancers, musicians, stage-players, and people that told pleasant tales, were brought into the hall to amuse the guests.\n\nPlutarch informs us, that Caesar, after his triumphs, treated the Roman people at 22,000 tables: and by calculation it would seem that there were at these tables upwards of 200,000 persons.\n\nAt the end of the feast the Romans drank out of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> cup as often as there were letters in the name of their mistress.\n\nFeasting seems to have been the chief delight of the Germans, Gauls, Britons, and all the other Celtic nations; in which they indulged themselves to the utmost, as often as they had an opportunity. \"Among these nations (says an author who had carefully studied their manners) there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>, either for civil or religious purposes, duly held; no birthday, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, or funeral, properly celebrated; no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> of peace or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> rightly cemented, without a great feast.\" It was by frequent entertainments of this kind that the great men or chieftains gained the affections and rewarded the services of their followers; and those who made the greatest feasts were sure to be most popular, and to have the greatest retinue. These feasts (in which plenty was more regarded than elegance) lasted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> several days, and the guests seldom retired until they had consumed all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> and exhausted all the liquors. Athenaeus describes an entertainment that was given by Arcamnes, a very wealthy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a>, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> a whole year without interruption, and at which all the people of Gaul, and even all strangers who passed through that country, were made welcome. At these feasts they sometimes consulted about the most important affairs of state, and formed resolutions relating to peace and war; imagining that men spoke their real sentiments with the greatest freedom, and were apt to form the boldest designs, when their spirits were exhilarated with the pleasures of the table. The conversation at these entertainments very frequently turned on the great exploits which the guests themselves or their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> had performed in war; which sometimes occasioned quarrels and even bloodshed. It was at a feast that the two illustrious British princes, Carbar and Olcar, quarrelled about their own bravery and that of their ancestors, and fell by mutual wounds. (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OSSIAN\">Ossian</a>, vol. ii. p. 8, &c.)\n\nAs to the drink used at these feasts, particularly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, it seems probable, that before the introduction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> into this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAD\">mead</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a> diluted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, was the only strong liquor known to its inhabitants, as it was to many other ancient nations in the same circumstances. This continued to be a favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEVERAGE\">beverage</a> among the ancient Britons, and their posterity <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> after they had become acquainted with other liquors. The mead-maker was the eleventh person in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> in the courts of the ancient princes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, and took place of the physician. The following ancient law of that principality shows how much this liquor was esteemed by the British princes\u2014\n\n\"There are three things in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> which must be communicated to the king before they are made known to any other person: 1. Every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> of the judge; 2. Every new song; and, 3. Every cask of mead.\"\n\nThis was perhaps the liquor which is called by Ossian the joy and strength of shells, with which his heroes were so much delighted. After the introduction of agriculture, ale or beer became the most general drink of all the British nations who practised that art, as it had long been of all the Celtic people on the continent. (See Ale.) If the Phoenicians or Greeks imported any wine into Britain, it was only in very small quantities; that most generous liquor being very little known in this island before it was conquered by the Romans. The drinking vessels of the Gauls, Britons, and other Celtic nations, were, for the most part, made of the horns of oxen and other animals; but those of the Caledonians consisted of large shells, which are still used by some of their posterity in the Highlands of Scotland.\n\nThe dishes in which the meat was served up were either of wood or earthen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WARE\">ware</a>, or a kind of baskets made of oifers. These last were most used by the Britons, as they very much excelled in the art of making them both for their own use and for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a>. The guests sat in a circle upon the ground, with a little hay, grass, or the skin of some animal under them. A low table or stool was set before each person, with the portion of meat allotted to him upon it. In this distribution, they never neglected to set the largest and best pieces before those who were most distinguished for their rank, their exploits, or their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>. Every guest took the meat set before him in his hands, and tearing it with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, fed upon it in the best manner he could. If any one found difficulty in separating any part of his meat with his hands and teeth, he made use of a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, that lay in a particular place for the benefit of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>. Servants, or young boys and girls, the children of the family, stood behind the guests, ready to help them to drink or anything they wanted.\nAs the ancient Britons greatly excelled and very much delighted in music, all their feasts were accompanied with the joys of song, and the music of harps. In the words of Oflan, \"whenever the feast of shells is prepared, the songs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARDS\">bards</a> arise. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of sprightly mirth is heard. The trembling harps of joy are strung. They sing the battles of heroes, or the heaving breasts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>.\" Some of the poems of that illustrious British bard appear to have been composed in order to be sung by the hundred bards of Fingal at the feast of Selma. Many of the songs of the bards which were sung and played at the feasts of the ancient Britons, were of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> and solemn strain, celebrating the brave actions of the guests, or of the heroes of other times; but there were sometimes intermixed with more sprightly and cheerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIRS\">airs</a>, to which the youth of both sexes danced, for the entertainment of the company.\n\nIt has been often observed by authors, that there is no nation in the world comes near the English in the magnificence of their feasts. Those made at our coronations, installments, consecrations, &c., transcend the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of all foreigners; and yet it is doubted whether those now in use are comparable to those of our forefathers.\n\nWilliam the Conqueror, after he was peaceably settled on the throne of England, sent agents into different countries, to collect the most admired and rare dishes for his table; by which means, says John of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALISBURY\">Salisbury</a>, this island, which is naturally productive of plenty and variety of provisions, was overflowed with everything that could inflame a luxurious appetite. The same writer tells us, that he was present at an entertainment which lasted from three o'clock in the afternoon to midnight; at which delicacies were served up, which had been brought from Constantinople, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLON\">Babylon</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIPOLI\">Tripoli</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, and Phoenicia. These delicacies, we may presume, were very expensive. Thomas Becket, if we may believe his historian Fitz-Stephen, gave \u00a31, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to \u00a375, at present, for one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISH\">dish</a> of eels. The sumptuous entertainments which the kings of England, and of other countries, gave to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a> and prelates, at the festivals of Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide, in which they spent a great part of their revenues, contributed very much to diffuse a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for profuse and expensive banqueting. It was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> for a proud and wealthy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">baron</a> to imitate in his own castle the entertainments he had seen in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of his prince. Many of the clergy too, both seculars and regulars, being very rich, kept excellent tables. The monks of St Swithins, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINCHESTER\">Winchester</a>, made a formal complaint to Henry II. against their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABBOT\">abbot</a>, for taking away three of the 13 dishes they used to have every day at dinner. The monks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTERBURY\">Canterbury</a> were still more luxurious: for they had at least 17 dishes every day, besides a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESSERT\">dessert</a>; and these dishes were dished with spices and sauces, which excited the appetite as well as pleased the taste.\n\nGreat men had some kinds of provisions at their tables that are not now to be found in Britain. When Henry II. entertained his own court, the great officers of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, with all the kings and great men of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>, at the feast of Christmas, A.D. 1171, the Irish princes and chieftains were quite astonished at the profusion and variety of provisions which they beheld, and were with difficulty prevailed upon by Henry to eat the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> of cranes, a kind of food to which they had not been accustomed. In the remaining monuments of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, we meet with the names of several dishes, as deligrout, maupigymun, karumpie, &c., the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of which is now unknown.\n\nThe coronation feast of Edward III. cost \u00a32835l. 18s. 2d., equivalent to about \u00a343,000 of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>. At the installation of Ralph abbot of St Augustine, Canterbury, A.D. 1309, 6000 guests were entertained with a dinner, consisting of 3000 dishes, which cost \u00a3287l. 5s. equal in efficacy to \u00a34300l. in our times. \"It would require a long treatise (says Matthew <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>) to describe the astonishing splendour, magnificence, and festivity with which the nuptials of Richard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Cornwall, and Cincia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Reinmund earl of Provence, were celebrated at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, A.D. 1243. To give the reader some idea of it, in a few words, above 30,000 dishes were served up at the marriage dinner.\" The nuptials of Alexander III. of Scotland, and the princess Margaret of England, were solemnized at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, A.D. 1211, with still greater pomp and profusion. \"If I attempted (says the same historian) to display all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> of this festivity,\u2014the numbers of the noble and illustrious guests,\u2014the richness and variety of the dresses,\u2014the sumptuousness of the feasts,\u2014the multitudes of the minstrels, mimicks, and others whose business it was to amuse and divert the company, those of my readers who were not present would imagine that I was imposing upon their credulity.\" The following particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> enable them to form a judgment of the whole. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of York made the king of England a present of 60 fat oxen, which made only one article of provision for the marriage feast, and were all consumed at that entertainment.\n\nThe marriage feast of Henry IV. and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> Jane of Navarre, consisted of six courses; three of flesh and fowls, and three of fish. All these courses were accompanied and adorned with jousting, as they were called. These jousters were figures in pastery, of men, women, beasts, birds, &c., placed on the table, to be admired, but not touched. Each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LABEL\">label</a> affixed to it containing some wise or witty saying, suited to the occasion of the feast, which was the reason they were called jousters. The installation feast of George Neville, archbishop of York and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> of England, exceeded all others in splendour and expense, and in the number and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the guests. The reader may form some idea of this enormous feast from the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of provisions prepared for it. In wheat, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, 300; in ale, tuns, 300; in wine, tuns, 100; in ipocrasse, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a>, 1; in oxen, 104; in wild bulls, 6; in muttons, 1000; in veals, 304; in porches, 304; in swans, 400; in geese, 2000; in capons, 1000; in pigs, 2000; in plovers, 400; in quails, 1200; in fowls, called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REES\">rees</a>, 2400; in peacocks, 104; in mallards and teales, 4000; in cranes, 204; in kids, 204; in chickens, 2000; in pigeons, 2000; in conies, 4000; in bitters, 204; in herons, 400; in pheasants, 200; in partridges, 500; in woodcocks, 400; in curlews, 100; in egrets, 1000; in flaggs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUCKS\">bucks</a>, and roes, 500 and more; in patties\nof venison, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, 4000; in parted dishes of jellies, 1000; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> dishes of jellies, 3000; in cold tarts, baked, 4000; in cold custards, baked, 3000; in hot pasties of venison, 1500; in hot custards, 2000; in pikes and breans, 308; in porpoises and seals, 12; spices, sugared delicacies, and waters, plenty. No turkeys are mentioned in this enormous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> of fare, because they were not then known in England. Cranes, heron/haws, porpoises, and seals, are seldom seen at modern entertainments.\n\nOne of the most expensive singularities attending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> feasts in those days consisted in what they called intermeats. These were representations of battles, sieges, &c., introduced between the courses, for the amusement of the guests. The French excelled in exhibitions of this kind. At a dinner given by Charles V. of France to the emperor Charles IV. A.D. 1378, the following intermeat was exhibited: A ship with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASTS\">masts</a>, sails, and rigging, was seen first: she had for colours the arms of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>: Godfrey de Bouillon appeared upon deck, accompanied by several knights armed cap-a-pie; the ship advanced into the middle of the hall, without the machine which moved it being perceptible. Then the city of Jerusalem appeared, with all its towers lined with Saracens. The ship approached the city; the Christians landed, and began the assault; the besieged made a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>: several scaling ladders were thrown down; but at length the city was taken. Intermeats at ordinary banquets consisted of certain delicate dishes introduced between the courses, and designed rather for gratifying the taste than for satisfying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>.\n\nAt those feasts, besides the ordinary drinks, ale and cider, there were great quantities of wines of various kinds. Of these last, the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of a poet who wrote in the fourth century, contain an ample enumeration.\n\nYe shall have rumney and malespine,\nBoth ypoocrasle and vernage wyne;\nMountrifffe and wyne of Greke,\nBoth algrade and despice eke,\nAntioche and basfarde,\nPyment allo, and garnarde,\nWyne of Greke and Mulcadell,\nBoth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLARE\">clare</a>, pyment, and Rochell.\n\nSome of these liquors, as ypoocras, pyment, and claret, were compounded of wine, honey, and spices of different kinds, and in different proportions.","sp":197,"ep":202},{"h":"FEATHER","t":"in Physiology, a general name for the covering of birds; it being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to all the animals of this class to have their whole body, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> at least the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of it, covered with feathers or plumage.

The latter adds, that they were first chosen out of the best families in Rome; that their office, which was reputed a sort of sacerdotal, or priesthood, only ended with their life; that their persons were sacred and inviolable, as those of other priests; that they were even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> to see the republic did not declare war unjustly; that they were to receive the complaints\nFecundity, and remonstrances of nations who pretended to have been any way injured by the Romans; that if those complaints were found <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a>, they were to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> the criminals, and deliver them up to those they had offended; that they were invested with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> and privileges of ambassadors; that they concluded treaties of peace and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a>, and took care they were executed; and, lastly, abolished them, if they were found not to be equitable.

Hence, where the bare liferent of any feudal subject is meant to be conveyed to A, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> property to B, that meaning is expressed thus; \"to A in liferent, and to B in fee.\" See LAW, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a>. lix. cliv.\n\nFees are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> divided into absolute, otherwise called fees-simple; and limited, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of which we usually call fee-tail.\n\n1. Tenant in fee-simple (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> as he is frequently styled, tenant-in-fee), is he that hath lands, tenements, or hereditaments, to hold to him and his heirs for ever; generally, absolutely and simply; without mentioning what heirs, but referring that to his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, or to the disposition of the law. The true meaning of the word fee (feodum) is the same with that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEUD\">feud</a> or feodum, and in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> it is taken in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> to allodium; which latter the writers on this subject define to be every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, which he possesseth merely in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, without owing any rent or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to any superior. This is property in its highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>; and the owner thereof hath absolutum et directum dominium, and therefore is said to be seised thereof absolutely in dominico suo, in his own demesne.\n\nBut feodum, or fee, is that which is held of some superior, on condition of rendering him service; in which superior the ultimate property of the land resides. And therefore Sir Henry Spelman defines a feud or fee to be, The right which the vassal or tenant hath in lands to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> the same and take the profits thereof to him and his heirs, rendering to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> his due services; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> allodial property of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> always remaining in the lord. This allodial property no subject in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> has; it being a received and now undeniable principle in the law, that all the lands are holden immediately or immediately of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>. The king therefore only hath absolutum et directum dominium; but all subjects' lands are in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of feodum or fee, whether derived to them by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, or purchased for a valuable consideration; for they cannot come to any man by either of those ways, unless accompanied with those feudal clogs which were laid upon the first feudatory when it was originally granted.\n\nA subject therefore hath only the usufruct, and not the absolute property, of the soil; or, as Sir Edward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COKE\">Coke</a> expresses it, he hath dominium utile, but not dominium directum. And hence it is, that, in the most solemn acts of law, we express the strongest and highest estate that any subject can have, by these words, \"he is seised thereof in his demesne, as of fee.\" It is a man's demesne, dominium, or property, since it belongs to him and his heirs for ever; yet this dominium, property, or demesne, is strictly not absolute or allodial, but qualified or feudal: it is of his demesne, as of fee; that is, it is not purely and simply his own, since it is held of a superior lord, in whom the ultimate property resides.\n\nThis is the primary sense and acceptation of the word fee. But (as Sir Martin Wright very justly observes) the doctrine, \"that all lands are holden,\" having been for so many ages a fixed and undeniable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a>, the English lawyers do very rarely (of late years especially), use the word fee in this its primary original sense, in contradistinction to allodium or absolute property, with which they have no concern; but generally use it to express the continuance or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of estate. A fee therefore, in general, signifies an estate of inheritance; being the highest and most extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> that a man can have in a feud: and when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> is used simply, without any other adjunct, or has the adjunct of simple annexed to it (as, a fee, or a fee-simple), it is used in contradistinction to a fee-conditional at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> law, or a fee-tail by the statute; importing an absolute inheritance, clear of any condition, limitation, or restrictions to particular heirs, but descendible to the heirs-general, whether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a>, lineal or collateral. And in no other estate than this is the king said to be seised in fee, he being the feudatory of no man.\n\nTaking therefore fee in this its secondary sense, as a state of inheritance, it is applicable to, and may be had in, any kind of hereditaments either corporeal or incorporeal. But there is this distinction between the two species of hereditaments; that of a corporeal inheritance a man shall be said to be seised in his demesne, as of fee; of an incorporeal one he shall only be said to be seised as of fee, and not in his demesne. For as incorporeal hereditaments are in their nature collateral to, and illie out of, lands and houses, their owner hath no property, dominium, or demesne, in the thing itself, but hath only something derived out of it; resembling the servitudes, or services, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CIVIL_LAW\">civil law</a>. The dominium, or property, is frequently in one man, while the appendage or service is in another. Thus Gaius may be seised as of fee, of a way going over the land, of which Titius is seised in his demesne as of fee.\n\nThe fee-simple or inheritance of lands and tenements is generally vested and resides in some person or other; though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> inferior estates may be carved out of it. As <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> one grants a lease for 21 years, or for one or two lives, the fee-simple remains vested in him and his heirs; and after the determination of those years or lives, the land reverts to the grantor or his heirs, who shall hold it again in fee-simple. Yet sometimes the fee may be in abeyance, that is (as the word signifies) in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> in law; there being no person in esse, in whom it can vest and abide, though...\nthough the law considers it as always potentially existing, and ready to vest whenever a proper owner appears. Thus, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> to John for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, and afterwards to the heirs of Richard, the inheritance is plainly neither granted to John nor Richard, nor can it vest in the heirs of Richard till his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, nam non est heres vivens: it remains therefore in waiting, or abeyance, during the life of Richard. This is likewise always the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of a parson of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, who hath only an estate therein for the term of his life; and the inheritance remains in abeyance. And not only the fee, but the freehold also, may be in abeyance; as, when a parson dies, the freehold of his glebe is in abeyance until a successor be named, and then it vests in the successor.\n\nThe word heirs is necessary in the grant or donation, in order to make a fee or inheritance. For if land be given to a man for ever, or to him and his assigns for ever, this vests in him but an estate for life. This very great nicety about the insertion of the word heirs in all donations and grants, in order to vest a fee, is plainly a relic of the feudal strictness by which it was required, that the form of the donation should be punctually purposed; or that, as Craig expresses it, in the words of Baldus, donationes sint stricti juris, ne quis plus donatique praefumaurum quam in donatione expresserit. And therefore, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> abilities of the donee were originally supposed to be the only inducements to the gift, the donee's estate in the land extended only to his own person, and subsisted no longer than his life; unless the donor, by an express provision in the grant, gave it a longer continuance, and extended it also to his heirs. But this rule is now softened by many exceptions.\n\nFor, 1. It does not tend to devolves by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>; in which, as they were introduced at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> when the feudal rigour was apace wearing out, a more liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> is allowed: and therefore by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVISE\">devise</a> to a man for ever, or to one and his assigns for ever, or to one in fee-simple, the devisee hath an estate of inheritance; for the intention of the deviser is sufficiently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> from the words of perpetuity annexed, though he hath omitted the legal words of inheritance. But if the devise be to a man and his assigns, without annexing words of perpetuity, there the devisee shall take only an estate for life; for it does not appear that the deviser intended any more. 2. Neither does this rule extend to fines or recoveries, considered as a species of conveyance; for thereby an estate in fee passes by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> and operation of law without the word heirs: as it does also, for particular reasons, by certain other methods of conveyance, which have relation to a former grant or estate, wherein the word heirs was expressed. 3. In creations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> by writ, the peer so created hath an inheritance in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>, without expressing the word heirs; for they are implied in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>, unless it be otherwise specially provided: but in creations by patent, which are stricti juris, the word heirs must be inserted, otherwise there is no inheritance. 4. In grants of lands to sole corporations and their successors, the word successors supplies the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of heirs; for as heirs take from the ancestor, so doth the successor from the predecessor. Nay, in a grant to a bishop, or other sole spiritual corporation, in frankalmogin, the word frankalmogin supplies the place of successors (as the word successors supplies the place of heirs) ex vi <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERMINI\">termini</a>; and in all these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> a fee-simple vests in such sole corporation. But, in a grant of lands to a corporation aggregate, the word successors is not necessary, though usually inserted: for, albeit such simple grant be strictly only an estate for life, yet as that corporation never dies, such estate for life is perpetual, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to a fee-simple, and therefore the law allows it to be one. Lastly, In the case of the king, a fee-simple will vest in him, without the words heirs or successors in the grant; partly from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> and partly from a reason similar to the last, because the king, in judgment of law, never dies. But the general rule is, that the word heirs is necessary to create an estate of inheritance.\n\nII. We are next to consider limited fees, or such estates of inheritance as are clogged and confined with conditions or qualifications of any sort. And these we may divide into two sorts: 1. Qualified or bate fees; and 2. Fees conditional, so called at the common law; and afterwards fees-tail, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the statute de donis.\n\n1. A base or qualified fee, is such a one as has a qualification subjoined thereto, and which must be determined whenever the qualification annexed to it is at an end. As, in the case of a grant to A and his heirs, tenants in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANOR\">manor</a> of Dale; in this instance, whenever the heirs of A cease to be tenants of that manor, the grant is entirely defeated. So, when Henry VI. granted to John Talbot, lord of the manor of Kingstone <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LISLE\">Lisle</a> in Berks, that he and his heirs, lords of the said manor, should be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEERS\">peers</a> of the realm, by the title of Barons of Lisle; here John Talbot had a base or qualified fee in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>; and the instant he or his heirs quitted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIGNIORY\">seigniory</a> of this manor, the dignity was at an end. This estate is a fee, because by possibility it may endure for ever in a man and his heirs; yet as that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> depends upon the concurrence of collateral circumstances, which qualify and debaute the purity of the donation, it is therefore a qualified or base fee.\n\n2.

One thing observed by M. de Buffon, which very greatly increases the solidity and strength of timber, is, that the trees intended to be felled for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> should first be stripped of their bark, and suffered to stand and die upon the spot before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a>. The fappy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> blea of the oak becomes by this means as hard and firm as the heart; and the real strength and density of the wood has been proved, by many experiments, to be greatly increased by it: nor is this a practice of any detriment to the proprietor, since the remaining stumps of these trees send up their young shoots as vigorously as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they had been cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> condition.\n\nWhen any tree is to be cut down for timber, the first thing to be taken care of is a skilful disbranching of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a> as may endanger it in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>: many trees are utterly spoiled for want of a previous care of this kind.

In felling the tree, take care always to cut it as close to the ground as possible, unless it is intended to be grubbed up: and the doing that is of advantage both to the timber and to the wood; for timber is never so much valued, if it be known to grow out of old stocks.","sp":205,"ep":205},{"h":"FELO DE SE","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">Law</a>, a person that lays deliberately violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> on himself, and is the occasion of his untimely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, whether by hanging, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DROWNING\">drowning</a>, stabbing, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> any other way.","sp":205,"ep":205},{"h":"FELONY","t":"in the general acceptation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, comprises every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of crime, which occasions at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> law the forfeiture of lands <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> goods. This most frequently happens in those crimes for which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> either is or was to be inflicted: for those felonies that are called clergyable, or to which the benefit of clergy extends, were anciently punished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> in all lay or unlearned offenders; though now, by the statute law, that punishment is for the first offence universally remitted. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">Treason</a> itself, says Sir Edward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COKE\">Coke</a>, was anciently comprised under the name of felony; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of this we may observe, that the statute of treasons, 25 Edw. III. c. 2. speaking of some dubious crimes, directs a reference to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>; that it may be there adjudged, \"whether they be treason or other felony.\" All treasons, therefore, strictly speaking, are felonies; though all felonies are not treason. And to this also we may add, that all offences, now capital, are in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> or other felony; but this is likewise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with some other offences, which are not punished with death; as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUICIDE\">suicide</a>, where the party is already dead; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOMICIDE\">homicide</a> by chance-medley, or in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SELF_DEFENCE\">self-<a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>; and petit-larceny, or pilfering; all which are (strictly speaking) felonies, as they subject the committers of them to forfeitures. So that, upon the whole, the only adequate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of felony seems to be that which is before laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>; viz. an offence which occasions a total forfeiture of either lands or goods, or both, at the common law; and to which capital or other punishment may be superadded, according to the degree of guilt.\n\nTo explain this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> a little farther: The word felony, or felonia, is of undoubted feudal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>, being frequently to be met with in the books of feuds, &c.; but the derivation of it has much puzzled the juridical lexicographers, Prateus, Calvinus, and the rest: some deriving it from the Greek, \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, \"an impostor or deceiver;\" others from the Latin, fallo, fefelli, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a>-\nFelony, nance which they would have it called fellonia. Sir Edward Coke, as his manner is, has given us a still stranger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a>; that it is crimen animo felleo perpetratum, \"with a bitter or gallish inclination.\" But all of them agree in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, that it is such a crime as works a forfeiture of all the offender's lands or goods. And this gives great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> to Sir Henry Spelman's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEUTONIC\">Teutonic</a> or German derivation of it: in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, indeed, as the word is clearly of feudal origin, we ought rather to look for its signification, than among the Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELON\">Felon</a> then, according to him, is derived from two northern words: FEE, which signifies (we well know) the fief, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEUD\">feud</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEFICIARY\">beneficiary</a> estate; and LON, which signifies price or value. Felony is therefore the same as pretium feudii, the consideration for which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> gives up his fief; as we say in common speech, such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> is as much as your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> or estate is worth. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> clearly signify the feudal forfeiture, or act by which an estate is forfeited, or escheats to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a>.\n\nTo confirm this, we may observe, that it is in this sense, of forfeiture to the lord, that the feudal writers constantly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> it. For all those acts, whether of a criminal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> or not, which at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> are generally forfeitures of copyhold estates, are styled felonies in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol9.html#article-FEUDAL_LAW\">feudal law</a>: \"si scilicet, per quas feudum amittitur.\" As \"si dominus deferviret nobiorem si per annum et diem essaverit in petenda invictura si dominum ejuravit, i.e. negavit se a domino feudum habere si a domino in jus eum vacante, ter citatus non comparuerit:\"\u2014all these, with many others, are still causes of forfeiture in our copyhold estates, and were denominated felonies by the feudal constitutions. So likewise injuries of a more substantial or criminal nature were denominated felonies, that is, forfeitures: as assaulting or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> the lord; vitiating his wife or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>, \"si dominum cucurbitaverit,\" i.e. cum uxor ejus concubuerit; all these are esteemed felonies, and the latter is expressly so denominated, \"si fecerit feloniam, dominum forte cucurbitando.\" And as these contempts, or smaller offences, were felonies or acts of forfeiture, of course greater crimes, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> and robbery, fell under the same denomination. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the lord might be guilty of felony, or forfeit his feignory to the vassal, by the same act as the vassal would have forfeited his feud to the lord. \"Si dominus commisit feloniam, per quam vassalus amitteret feudum si <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAM\">cam</a> committerit in dominium, feudii proprietatem etiam dominus perdere debet.\"\n\nOne instance given of this sort of felony in the lord is beating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> of his vassal, so that he loses his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>; which seems merely in the nature of a civil injury, so far as it respects the vassal. And all these felonies were to be determined, \"per laudamentum five judicium parium suorum,\" in the lord's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>; as with us forfeitures of copyhold lands are presentable by the homage in the court-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">baron</a>.\n\nFelony, and the act of forfeiture to the lord, being thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a> terms in the feudal law, we may callily trace the reason why, upon the introduction of that law into England, those crimes which induced such forfeiture or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESCHEAT\">escheat</a> of lands (and, by a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFECTION\">defection</a> from the original sense, such as induced the forfeiture of goods also) were denominated felonies. Thus it was that suicide, robbery, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAPE\">rape</a>, were felonies; that is, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of such crimes was forfeiture; till by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> use we began to signify by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of felony the actual crime committed, and not the penal consequence. And upon this system only can we account for the cause, why treason in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> times was held to be a species of felony; viz. because it induced a forfeiture.\n\nHence it follows, that capital punishment does by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means enter into the true idea and definition of felony. Felony may be without inflicting capital punishment, as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> instances of self-murder, excusable homicide, and petit-larceny: and it is possible that capital punishments may be inflicted, and yet the offence be no felony; as in case of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a> by the common law, which, though capital, never worked any forfeiture of lands or goods, an inseparable incident to felony. And of the same nature was the punishment of standing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MUTE\">mute</a>, without pleading to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDICTMENT\">indictment</a>; which at the common law was capital, but without any forfeiture, therefore such standing mute was no felony. In short, the true criterion of felony is forfeiture: for, as Sir Edward Coke justly observes, in all felonies which are punishable with death, the offender loses all his lands in fee-simple, and also his goods and chattels; in such as are not punishable, his goods and chattels only.\n\nThe idea of felony is indeed so generally connected with that of capital punishment, that we find it hard to separate them; and to this usage the interpretations of the law do now conform. And therefore, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> a statute makes any new offence felony, the law implies that it shall be punished with death, viz. by hanging, as well as with forfeiture: unless the offender pays the benefit of clergy; which all felons are entitled once to have, unless the same is expressly taken away by statute.\n\nFelonies by statute are very numerous; and as this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> will not admit of a proper enumeration, we must refer to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> of the quarto edition of the Statutes, where they are set forth in alphabetical order.","sp":205,"ep":206},{"h":"FELTING","t":"the method of working up <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of cloth, independent of either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINNING\">spinning</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEAVING\">weaving</a>. Felting in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> is not much practised, except in the manufacturing of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a>; and as the generality even of those who are employed in making them, are unacquainted with the principles on which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, a few observations on the method of felting may, to such, be both useful and agreeable.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> wool, the hair of a rabbit, hare, beaver, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a>-hair, be examined with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a> of the greatest magnifying power, the surface of each hair appears perfectly smooth, or if any inequalities are observed, they do not appear so much to arise from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> surface, as from some peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> and transparency of the substances examined; for if their image be viewed by a solar microscope, it terminates in even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, without the smallest vestige of any roughness. Yet nothing is more evident than that the surfaces of hairs are not perfectly smooth, but either composed of lamellae covering each other from the root to the point, resembling the scales of fishes; or what some have deemed more\nmore probable, of zones placed over each other, similar to the structure of horns; and to this texture, hair, wool, &c., owe their disposition for what is denominated felting.\n\nLet a person take hold of a hair by the root with one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and draw it between two fingers of the other, from the root towards the point, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> scarcely perceive any friction, or hear any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>; but should he hold the hair by the point, and draw it between his fingers from the point towards the root, he will feel a sensible opposition or resistance which could not be felt before. A sort of tremulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> is likewise produced, which can be distinguished by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>. From this simple experiment it is obvious that the texture of the surface of a hair is not the same from the point to the root, as it is from the root to the point. If a hair is taken hold of by the fore-finger and thumb, and rubbed in a longitudinal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, a progressive motion is the result, which is invariably towards the root. This is wholly independent of the texture or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the skin of the fingers; for if the hair be turned, and the point of it placed where the root formerly was, the movement becomes contrary, or, in other words, it is still directed towards the root.\n\nIt is found a very difficult task to untie a knot made in the middle of a hair, on account of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> thinness; but if the hair is placed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> of the hand, the knot being in a line with the little finger, and if the hair is grasped by closing the hand, and the fist struck several times against the knee, the knot is thereby opened, because the asperities of one end of the hair are in a contrary direction to those of the other, by which means each end of it recedes a little. By the introduction of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> into the eye thus formed at the knot, it is easily untied. Although these observations have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> reference to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> hair; yet they are equally applicable to wool, furs, and almost every species of animal hair. The surfaces of all these consist of hard lamellae, placed upon each other like tiles, in the direction from the root to the point.\n\nBy attending to these remarks, it is easy to see why the contact of woollen stuffs is rough to the skin. The asperities on the surface of the fibres of wool produce a disagreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>, by fixing themselves in the skin, which can only be endured by being accustomed to feel it frequently. The injury done to wounds by the application of wool, is not the result of any chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, but is entirely occasioned by the asperities of its surface.\n\nA hatter separates the hairs from each other, by striking the wool with the string of his bow, causing them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> up in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> in every possible direction, forming a layer of a particular thickness, which is covered by the workmen with a cloth, pressing it with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and moving the hairs backwards and forwards in different directions. In this manner the hairs are brought against each other, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of contact considerably multiplied, and the agitation gives each hair a progressive motion towards the root, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which the hairs become twisted together. As the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> becomes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a>, the pressure ought to be increased, in order to keep up the progressive motion and twisting of the hairs, which is then performed with greater difficulty.\n\nThe hair designed for the manufacturing of hats is always cut off with a sharp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, and not pulled out by the roots, because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> of the hair which would come out with it in the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, would render the end which was fixed in the skin very obtuse, and nearly destroy its disposition to unite with the adjacent hairs. But in addition to the tendency of hairs to move progressively towards the root, they should not be straight like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLES\">needles</a>, for in this case they could not produce any compactness in the stuff. The fibres of wool having naturally a crooked form, that substance is well adapted to the operation of felting. The hair of beavers, rabbits, hares, &c., being straight, it cannot be employed in felting by itself, till it has been subjected to a previous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>, viz. rubbing and combing on the skin, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> being dipped in a solution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> in nitric acid. This substance, by acting only on one side of the hairs, gives them that disposition to felting which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to wool.\n\nWhen it is not intended that the hairs shall enter into the body of the mass, but serve only as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> coating, which is sometimes given to the outer surface of hats, the operation with the nitric acid need not be performed. They must be uniformly spread upon the surface to which the coating is to be applied, and being covered with a cloth, it is pressed with the hands, and agitated for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. They receive a particular direction afterwards by means of a brush, and are enabled to keep it by having a hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> passed over them.

Fowl and fish are very plentiful in them. The pike and eels are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and easily caught, but they are usually coarse. The duck, mallard, and teal, are in such plenty as is scarce to be conceived. They are taken by decoys in prodigious flocks at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. They send these fowl from Lincolnshire to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, twice a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, on horseback, from Michaelmas to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; and one decoy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> furnish 20 dozen, or more, twice a-week, for the whole season in this manner. The decoy-men <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> with the people, who bring them to London at a certain rate, and they are obliged to take off their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> that is catched. Two teal are usually reckoned equal to one duck; and five ducks and twelve teal are accounted a dozen of wild fowl; and the usual market price is about 9s. for such a dozen. About midsummer, during the moulting season, a great number also are destroyed by the people in the neighbourhoods. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> birds at this season are neither able to swim nor fly well; and the people going in with boats among the reeds where they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a>, knock them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a>. A little before Michaelmas, vast flights of these birds arrive at the decoys from other places; they soon grow fat in them, and continue there a prey to the masters or owners, as long as the decoys are unfrozen; but, when they are iced over, they fly away again, and go to the neighbouring seas for food.\n\nThe fens also abound in a sort of herbage that is very nourishing to cattle. Sheep and horses always grow fat upon it. The fens are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>, and the owners of cattle mark them that they may be known.\n\nIt is remarkable, that, though all is open, the cattle used to one particular spot of ground seldom leave it, but the owner may always find them in or near the same place. The fens have many large and deep drains. In these the pike and eel grow to a vast size; and they are full of geese which feed on the grass; but these eat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and muddy, and may even be found as soon as a person comes into the room where they are roosting. But the people have another very great advantage from these birds besides the eating of them, namely, their feathers and quills; and the produce of these is so great, that the customhouse books in the town of Bollton show, that there are frequently sent away in one year 300 bags of feathers, each containing a hundred and a half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>. Each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of feathers brings in the owner twopence; and it may be thought strange by people unacquainted with these things, but it is a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, that the owners pull them five or six times a year for the feathers, and three times for the quills. Each pulling comes to about a pound, and many people have 1000 geese at a time, or more. They are kept at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> charge, except in deep snowy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, when they are obliged to feed them with corn.\n\nOats also grow very well in many of the fen countries, and in good seasons bring great increase and advantage to the owners. There is also another vegetable of great profit to them. This is the *rapum fibrofre*; the feed of which they call *cole-feed*; and they make an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> from it of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in trade. They grind the feed between two large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, the one standing perpendicularly on the other. The stones are made of a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> marble, and are brought from Germany. They sometimes turn them by sails, and sometimes by the drains which carry off the water from the fen lands.\n\nThe fens lying low, and being of a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, are very subject to be overflowed by waters from the neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> countries; and though great care and expense is used to keep them dry, they are often like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>; and the sheep are obliged to be carried off in boats, and the people to live in their upper rooms, and to be supplied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> also with boats.","sp":208,"ep":208},{"h":"FENCE","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARDENING\">Gardening</a> and Husbandry, a hedge, wall, ditch, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> other enclosure, made round gardens, fields, woods, &c.\n\nIn hot climates, where they have not occasion for walls to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIPEN\">ripen</a> their fruit, their gardens <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> open, where they can have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> fence, and prospects; or else they bound their gardens with groves, in which are fountains, walks, &c., which are much more pleasing to the sight than a dead wall; but, in colder countries, we are obliged to have walls to shelter and ripen our fruit, although they take away much from the pleasant prospect of the garden. Brick walls are accounted the best and warmest for fruit: and these walls, being built panel-wise, with pillars at equal distances, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>, in that the walls may be built thinner than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they were made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> without these panels, for then it would be necessary to build them thicker everywhere; and, besides, these panels make the walls look the handsomer. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">Stone</a> walls, however, on account of their durability, are to be preferred to those of brick, especially those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> hewn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>. Those that are made of rough stones, though\nthough they are very dry and warm, yet, by reason of their unevenness, are inconvenient to nail up trees to, except pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> be laid in them here and there for that purpose.\n\nBut, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> gardens, it is better to have the prospect open to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> garden; which should be surrounded with a fence, that from the garden the adjacent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> may be viewed. But this must depend on the situation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>: for, if the prospect from the garden is not good, it had better be shut out from the sight than be open. As also, when a garden lies near a populous town, and the adjoining grounds are open to the inhabitants; if the garden is open, there will be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> walking there in good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, without being exposed to the view of all passersby, which is very disagreeable.\n\nWhere the fences are made round a garden which is situated in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARK\">park</a>, they are extremely proper; because hereby the prospect of the park will be obtained in the garden, which renders those gardens much more agreeable than those that are confined.\u2014In the making these fences there have been many inventions; but, upon the whole, none seem preferable to those which have an upright wall next the garden, which (where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> will admit of a deep trench) should be five or six feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>; and, from the foot of this wall, the ground on the outside should rise with a gradual easy slope, to the distance of 18 or 20 feet; and where it can be allowed, if it slopes much farther it will be easier, and less perceptible as a ditch, to the eye, when viewed at a distance; but, if the ground is naturally wet, so as not to admit a deep fence, then, in order to make a fence against cattle, if the wall be four feet high, and flight posts of three feet high are placed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> behind the wall, with a small chain carried on from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> to post, no cattle or deer will ever attempt to jump against it; therefore it will be a secure fence against them; and if these are painted green, they will not be discerned at a distance, and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the chain will secure persons walking in the garden from tumbling over.\n\nIn places where there are no good prospects to be obtained from a garden, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to make the enclosure of park palings; which, if well performed, will last many years, and has a much better appearance than a wall; and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> may be hid from the sight within, by plantations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-EVERGREENS\">evergreens</a>; or there may be a quick hedge planted within the pale, which may be trained up, so as to be an excellent fence by the time the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALES\">pales</a> begin to decay.\n\nFences round parks are generally of palings; which, if well made of winter-fallen oak, will last many years. But a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> thing to be observed, in making these pales, is not to make them too heavy: for, when they are so, their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> will cause them to decay; therefore the pales should be cleft thin; and the rails should be cut triangular, to prevent the wet lodging upon them; and the posts should be good, and not placed too far asunder. If these things are observed, one of these pales will last, with a little care, upwards of 40 years very well. The common way of making these fences is, to have every other pale <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> or ten inches above the intermediate ones; so that the fence may be six feet and a half high, which is enough for fallow deer; but, where there are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> deer, the fence should be one foot higher, otherwise they will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAP\">leap</a> over.\n\nSome enclose their parks with brick walls; and in countries where stone is cheap, the walls are built with this material; some with, and others without, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a>.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a> garden, if rightly contrived, will contain walling enough to afford a supply of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> as require the affluence of walls, for any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>; and this garden, being situated on one side, and quite out of sight of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, may be surrounded with walls which will screen the kitchen garden from the sight of persons in the pleasure garden; and, being locked up, the fruit will be much better preserved than it can be in the public garden; and the having too great a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of walling is often the occasion that so many ill managed trees are frequently to be seen in large gardens.\n\nThe height of garden walls should be 12 feet, which is a moderate proportion; and, if the soil be good, it may in time be well furnished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> wood in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>, especially that part planted with pears, notwithstanding of the branches being trained horizontally from the bottom of the walls.\n\nWith regard to the different kinds of fences, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>.\n\nFence-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">Month</a>, the month wherein deer begin to fawn, during which it is unlawful to hunt in the forest.\n\nIt commences 15 days before Midsummer, and ends 15 days after it.

Hence it deserves our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> in a particular manner; a knowledge of the different feuds being indispensably requisite for a proper understanding either of the civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, or of the laws by which its landed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> is regulated.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> policy of the Celtic or northern nations, known by the names of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHS\">Goths</a>, Vandals, Franks, Huns, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOMBARDS\">Lombards</a>, furnished the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> constitution or system of feuds. These people pouring out in vast multitudes from the same officina gentium or \"storehouse of nations,\" overran all the European countries on the declension of the Roman empire. They brought the feudal system along with them from the countries out of which they emigrated; and, supposing it to be the most proper method of securing their new conquests, they introduced it into their more southerly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>.\n\nAccording to this system, the victorious general allotted considerable tracts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> officers; while they, in like manner, divided their possessions among the inferior officers, and even those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> who were thought to be the most deserving. Allotments of this kind were named feoda, fiefs, fees, or feuds, from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of words, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of these barbarians, signifying a reward or stipend bestowed on certain conditions (a). The condition upon which these rewards were given was, that the possessors should faithfully serve the person from whom they were received, both at home and abroad, in the military way. To this they engaged themselves by a juramentum fidelitatis, or oath of fealty;\u2020 in the event of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> of which, either by not performing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> due, or by transposing these two northern syllables,\n\n(A) We were informed by Pontopiddan, that odh in these northern languages is the same with proprietas, and dovall: in ALL with totum in the Latin. Hence among the northern nations, he tells us, that odhall signifies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIN\">fin</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> 2, and hence we may conjecture that the udal right in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINLAND\">Finland</a> is derived \u2020. By transposing these two northern syllables,\nservice agreed upon, by deserting their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, &c., the lands were to return to their original possessor.\n\nThus the possessors of feudal allotments became interested in the defense of them; and not only the receivers but those who gave them, were equally and mutually bound to defend their possessions, none of them being able to pretend any right but that of conquest. For this purpose government and subordination were absolutely necessary; it being impossible to conduct any system of defense where every thing was tumultuous and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>. Every person, therefore, who was a feudatory, i.e. who had received lands, was bound to do everything in his power to defend the lord of his fee; while, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the latter was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less subordinate to his immediate superior; and so on to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> himself. In like manner a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> bond of defense existed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> from the prince to the lowest feudists.\n\nSuch were the foundations on which the feudal system was properly established; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> was, a military subjection throughout the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>. The prince could always collect an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of feudatories ready to defend not only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> in general, but the particular possessions of each person; and the propriety of this constitution was soon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> in the strength which these newly erected kingdoms acquired, and the valor with which their conquests were defended.\n\nBesides these feudal grants, however, which were held only on the terms of military service above mentioned, there were others called allodial, which were given upon more enlarged principles. To these every free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>; and could not only claim his territory as well as the rest, but dispose of it at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> (n); and this freedom was denominated allodality. These allodials, however, were not exempted from military service. A part of their freedom consisted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to go to the wars; for this, in the barbarous times we speak of, was the only way to acquire any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of renown. Only the slaves were defined to follow the arts of peace; while every free person was not only at liberty to defend his country, but under an obligation to do it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of any urgent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>.\n\nThus there was a feudal and a national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a>. The feudal and free people only were allowed to possess property; the national feudal vassals constituted the army, properly so called; militia, while the national militia was composed of the allodial proprietors. This allodality, however, was not confined to landed property, but included likewise moveable estates or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>; so that proprietors of the latter kind were obliged also in times of danger to bear arms and appear in the field. Between the feudal and different allodial proprietors, however, there was this farther situation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>, that the latter had no concern with any of the feudal lords themselves; so that they were never obliged to appear in the field unless when called forth by the sovereign against the enemies of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>. This circumstance we might suppose to be an advantage, but it ultimately operated otherwise; becoming the means of changing the allodial right into a feudal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENURE\">tenure</a>. For some time the holders of fiefs had an eminent advantage over the allodial proprietors. This was owing to the imperfection of government in those days; so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a> had it in their power to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> their own quarrels, while the weak were equally exposed to the insults of both parties. The lord and his vassals therefore were always formidable; but the allodial\n\n---\n\n(b) The author of *A View of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> in Europe*, has traced the remote sources of the feudal laws in an elegant and spirited manner (book i. chap. ii. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. i.) Tacitus informs us, that the individuals of each of the German nations cultivated by turns a tract of land proportionate to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the whole; after which each individual received such an allotment of the cultivated tract as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> seemed to require. These nations had not altered their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> principles at the time they overran the Roman empire; and hence the provinces of it were then divided after the same manner. The most considerable allotment was bestowed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, as being the most dignified person in the community, and this allotment was styled his domain; while the shares of citizens and warriors, which were likewise in proportion to the merit or dignity of each, constituted what was called allodality. But as it often happened that all the land was not exhausted by these partitions, what remained was considered as the property of the community, and in the barbaric codes was called the lands of the fisc. In such German nations as had thus obtained a settlement, it was necessary that there should be a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> connexion betwixt the sovereign and the chiefs, as well as between the chiefs and people, than in others. This was effected by means of the lands of the fisc; for of these the sovereign took possession, dealing them out to the chiefs under the burden of appearing in arms whenever he should please to call; while the chiefs in like manner dealt out lands to those called their retainers, who were also obliged to supply them with military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of necessity. Hence a political system was founded, which had a prodigious effect on society in all those countries where it prevailed. The intention and tendency of this system was to render the nation independent both at home and abroad; for, while the people were all armed in their common defense, individuals were also properly guarded against the attacks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPOPULATION\">depopulation</a>. The power of the chiefs, who formed a regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, was a counterpoise to that of the sovereign; while the number of the retainers and vassals, constituting the greatness and power of the nobility, was a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> against aristocratical oppression; for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> who oppressed his vassals evidently acted against his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>.\nFeudal proprietors had scarce any means of defending themselves. The reason of this was, in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, that the law did not allow them to commit any hostilities; and in the next, they were too distant and unconnected to form any proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> for mutual defense; and hence proceeded the necessity already hinted at, of converting allodial property into feudal tenure. This was indeed owing in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> to the absurdity and violence of the times, by which gifts of property, burdened with service, and which might return to the person who granted them, were rendered superior in value to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> and unconditional possession of a subject. Other considerations, however, besides those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned, contributed to produce the same effect. As in those dark ages no right existed but what had its origin in conquest, it thence followed, that the greatest conqueror or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a> was the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> person. The king, in whom the whole exploits of the community centered, as being their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, was the most honourable person: all others derived from him that portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> which they enjoyed, and which was most nicely adjusted in proportion as they approached him. Allodial proprietors, therefore, having no pretensions of this kind, were treated with contempt as a kind of poltroons. From this disagreeable situation they wished to free themselves, by converting their allodial property into feudal tenures; while the princes, supposing it their interest to extend those tenures as much as possible, discouraged the allodial possessions. As the feudists supported the conversion of the nation and dignity of the monarch, of allodium it was not thought proper to allow the allodial proprietors any greater compensations than what were given to vassals in similar cases. Thus they were exposed to continual mortifications in the courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>: they were neglected by the king; denied sufficient protection from the laws; exposed not only to continual insults; but to have their property on all occasions destroyed by the great: so that they were without resource except from the feudal tenures, and were obliged even to solicit the privileges which were bestowed in other cases on vassals. In these unhappy circumstances, they were glad to yield up their lands to any superior whom they thought most agreeable, and to receive them back from him as a feudal gift. Thus the landed property was everywhere changed into feudal tenures, and fiefs became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> (c).\n\nFor some time the feudal system was not only useful in itself, but honourable in its principles; but this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> no longer than while the importers of it into Europe adhered to their original simple and noble maxims. During that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, the lord exercised his bounty.\n\n(c) It has been an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of inquiry to the learned, in what nation of barbarians fiefs had their origin? But it is probable, that they took place in all these nations nearly about the same time, on the same principles; and were continued by reason of a similarity of manners, conquests, &c., so that we cannot ascribe the prevalence of them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>.\n\nIn France, we find mention made of fiefs as early as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of Childebert. They were introduced into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> by the Lombards; amongst whom the customs and laws relating to fiefs seem very early to have made rapid advances*. They were introduced into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> before the invasion of the Moors and Saracens in the year 710. Lands were granted for service and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> among the Goths; among whom also the person who received the gift was the retainer of him who granted it. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> he refused his service, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> was forfeited, and he was said to receive it in patronio; he also swore fealty to his lord; and on this footing the national militia was regulated\u2020. There can be very little doubt that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol9.html#article-FEUDAL_LAW\">feudal law</a> was known in England in the Saxon times, as is mentioned in the text. In Scotland, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of fiefs is still more uncertain than anywhere else; which has been ascribed partly to the mutilated state of the Scottish records, and partly to the want of able antiquaries in the nation. But, according to a late writer\u2021, allodiality and feudalism have existed ever since the foundation of the Scottish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>, and have most probably arisen from a familiarity of the manners and customs in Scotland to those of other nations. It has indeed been supposed, that these customs were introduced from some foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> by Malcolm II. According to some, they were introduced directly from England; and the policy of Malcolm in establishing them has been highly extolled: but, according to our author, there is no foundation for any notion of that kind. Both the opinions just mentioned either directly assert or imply, that the feudal maxims were introduced into this country upon the principle of imitation; but it is very improbable that they could be imported from one people to another, on account of their excessive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRARIETY\">contrariety</a> to the common usages and precepts of government among mankind. It must undoubtedly have been very absurd, if not altogether impracticable, to transplant the feudal tenures when the grants of land were precarious, or depending entirely on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> of the prince, to a country which had never known superiority or vassalage. This would have required an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> of all the orders of society from the king to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a>; while the whole chain of customs, as well as the jurisdiction of the kingdom, both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> and low, must have sustained a corresponding alteration, in order to conform them to the new system. It is likewise obvious, that no conquest could be made on purpose to obtain a settlement by any nation who had already received the knowledge of fiefs. The establishment of them implied, that the people had already a fixed and settled residence; and accordingly history does not furnish us with any account of a nation among whom fiefs were known, who ever migrated from the country they already possessed, to seek for one in which they might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a>. Feudal institutions must have originated wherever they have been observed to flourish.\u2014Scotland was formerly a feudal kingdom, and we know pretty nearly the time when the fiefs were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> there; but in that form they could not be introduced by the sovereign; and there was not any nation among whom fiefs were already known who conquered, or made an establishment by conquest, in Scotland. Fiefs therefore must have gradually advanced to such a state of perfection. The progress they made may be likewise easily\nbounty to the vassal, which the latter repaid by acts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>; so that the intercourse between them was of the most tender and affectionate kind; and this gave rise to what are called the feudal incidents.\n\nThe expectants of fiefs were educated in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> of the superior, while the tenures were precarious or only for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; and even when they became hereditary, the lord took care of the son and estate of his deceased vassal; not only protecting his person, but taking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, and directing the management of his affairs. He took pleasure in observing his approach to maturity; and when he came of age, never failed to deliver to him the lands, with the care of which he had been intrusted, and which he had been careful to improve. This was called the incident of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARDSHIP\">wardship</a>.\n\nThe incident of relief was founded upon the gratitude of the vassal; who, upon entering on his fief, brought a present to his lord, as an acknowledgment of his care of him during the early part of his life; and in order to conciliate his future regard.\n\nThe incident of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> proceeded also upon the principle of gratitude on the part of the vassal. The latter, conscious of the favours he had received, did not choose to ally himself with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> inimical to his chief; while the superior himself, ambitious to aggrandize and augment the importance of his family, sought how to find the most advantageous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> for his vassal.\n\nSometimes the superior himself was reduced in his circumstances by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> or other accident; but from whatever cause his distress proceeded, even though it had arisen from his own extravagance or prodigality, or when only destitute of means to support his ambition or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>, his vassals were bound to support and relieve him according to their circumstances; and this was called the incident of aid.\n\nThe incident of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESCHEAT\">escheat</a> took place on the part of the vassal, when, through cowardice, treachery, or any remarkable misbehaviour, he rendered himself unworthy of his fief. In that case, the taking it from him, and giving it to one more worthy, was called an escheat.\n\nWhile the lords and vassals thus vied with one another in mutual acts of friendship and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, universal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>, liberty, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>, were diffused throughout the society. The vassals behaved courteously towards the retainers, who were immediately below them; while they again were courted by the lords as constituting their importance and strength; the lords, lastly, giving a like importance and dignity to the sovereign himself. Thus a regular, powerful, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> system of government took place; an unanimity and attention pervaded the various departments of state; so that, while the subjects were free, the nation at large was formidable.\n\nDuring this happy state of affairs, the members of the national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> in every country in Europe appeared there in arms, whether they came personally or by their representatives. Such particularly was the case under the Anglo-Saxon government; and the happiness they at that time enjoyed made the oppression and tyranny of the Normans appear the more intolerable.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time, however, the state of society began to suffer a remarkable alteration. The high and disinterested notions, from which the happiness above mentioned took its origin, declined; the romantic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of chivalry ceased; and much more interested notions of property came in their stead. The separation of the interests of the lords from their vassals was the first step towards the destruction of the feudal system. Thus the incidents, which, as has just now been mentioned, promoted their happiness, did the very reverse. Property being now looked upon as a distinction superior to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> merit, naturally introduced the most mercenary views. In consequence of these the infant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARD\">ward</a>, the care of whom was wont to be considered as a sacred and honorary trust, was now only looked upon as a means of procuring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a> to the superior. The latter now regarded the profits of his vassals as so many diminutions of his own wealth. Instead of taking care to improve the estate of his ward as formerly, he impoverished it; not only neglecting the education of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a>, but offering insults to himself; inasmuch that the relations of the unfortunate vassal were frequently obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RANSOM\">ransom</a> from the avaricious superior both his person and effects. By merchandise of this kind the coffers of princes were filled, and wardships let out to strangers, who might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> their rapacity with greater freedom. When the vassal at last attained the years of maturity, he came to the possession of his land without any of that joy and festivity which usually took place on the occasion. He received an inheritance wasted and destroyed, while new grievances daily presented themselves to augment the horrors of his situation. All the incidents, which in former times oppressed were so many expressions of gratitude on the part of the situation of vassal, were now changed into taxes which might be exacted at the pleasure of the lord. Before the vassal was invested in his land, the superior exacted from him a certain sum or other gift, to be measured only by his own rapacity; and in case of delay or inability to pay this demand, the superior continued in possession of the estate. Such scandalous oppression could not but produce the greatest discontent and clamour. Applications were made to the law without success; nor were even the laws regarded which were fabricated on purpose for their relief. The incident of marriage now proved a source of the most dreadful oppression. The lord assumed a right of marrying his vassal to whom he pleased; and he not only exerted this right himself, but would sell it to a stranger, or allow the vassal to buy it himself; while the penalty annexed to a marriage without\nout the consent of the superior involved no less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> than the loss of the estate itself, or some grievous infliction as for a crime of the first magnitude. The case was still worse with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> ward; whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and accomplishments became a source of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> to the superior, or were sacrificed to please his whims or caprices; so that her relations were frequently obliged to buy from him the privilege of marrying her to the person she or they thought most proper. In like manner the aid, which was formerly a voluntary gift from the vassal in cases of distress happening to his lord, now became an unavoidable tax. An aid formerly was demanded when the eldest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of the superior was married, when his eldest son was knighted, or when the superior himself was taken prisoner in battle. These were the only legal causes of making a demand of this kind; but in the subsequent times of degeneracy, the most frivolous pretences were every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> made use of by the prince to oppress the lords, and by the lords to oppress their vassals; demanding subsidies at pleasure, which their inferiors were always obliged to comply with. Lastly, the efcheat, which in former times took place only in cases of cowardice, treachery, or some other heinous crime, was now inflicted on the most trifling occasions. If the vassal happened to be too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> in attending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of his superior to take the oath of fealty; if he committed any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> which could in the least be construed an infringement of the oath; if he neglected to give his lord warning of any misfortune which he might suppose was about to befall him; revealed any thing concerning him; made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> to his sister or daughter, &c.; or even if he should grant a tenure of land to another person in form different from that in which he held his own; all these, nay others still more ridiculous, were judged sufficient reasons for the superior to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> on the estate of the vassal, and involve him and his family in ruin.\n\nNotwithstanding these oppressions, however, the vassal was still obliged to submit to his lord; to own him as his superior; and even, in appearance, to pay him the same respect as formerly when the greatest unanimity and cordial affection subsisted between them. Still he was obliged to perform the same military service; because a failure in that respect would have subjected him to a forfeiture of lands according to the original agreement. A vast difference, however, now took place in the valour and activity which inspired the army. The vassals, forced into the field with desponding hearts, were indifferent as to the success of the cause in which they were engaged, and frequently obstructed instead of forwarding the operations of the field. Hence the sovereign found himself embarrassed; and, though nominally at the head of a martial and powerful people, was frequently unable to effect anything, by reason of the mutual hatred and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> which everywhere prevailed.\n\nThus the feudal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of Europe became unnaturally weak: a remedy was necessary; and it is remarkable that the same remedy was applied all over the continent. This was, in short, the making fiefs hereditary, which till now had only been granted for a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of years; and, in return, burdening the lands with a certain number of soldiers, which were not to be refused upon any pretence whatever. Hence was derived the tenure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a>-service. A certain portion of land, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> burdened with the service of one soldier or knight, was called a knight's fee; and thus an estate, furnishing any service, number of soldiers, was paid to contain as many knight's fees; so that now the manors, baronies, &c., became powerful according to the number of soldiers they were bound to furnish. In the grants from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, the nobility were obliged to furnish a certain number of soldiers for the service of the sovereign; and in those from the nobility to their vassals, the like service was required. Even the commons who had grants from the crown furnished a certain proportion of knights. The force of the nation was called into action by grants in capitae, or from the sovereign and nobility. A numerous and powerful army was instantly assembled, and at once ready for action. Of this army the king was the general, the nobility the officers, and the vassals soldiers; the whole being exactly arranged, and capable of entering upon any expedition without the least delay.\n\nThus a remedy was found in some measure for the weaknesses of the feudal sovereigns; but though the knights' tenure could accomplish this, it could not bring back the former affection and cordiality which subsisted between the various ranks of people. On the contrary, by uniting them more firmly to one another by legal ties, it rendered matters rather worse. The oppression originating from the operation of the feudal incidents, still continued with unremitting violence. The grants of knights' tenure were attended with the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a> of homage and fealty; the same incidents of relief, wardship, marriage, aid, and efcheat, with the feudal tenures. The princes promised to abate somewhat of their rigour in demanding the feudal perquisites, but did not keep their word. Laws were occasionally promulgated, and for some time had an effect; but palliatives soon became ineffectual, and a new state of weakness began to commence.\n\nThe two remarkable eras in the feudal history are, the time before the invention of knight-service (D), and the history that during which it continued. Fiefs were in a state of fluctuation from the destruction of the Roman empire till the ninth century; but they were rendered perpetual in France about the year 877, and were generally become so in every country of Europe about the beginning of the tenth. Du Cange, voce Militia, gives us an example of a knight fee in the year 830. By the year 987, when Hugh Capet was raised to the throne of France, knight service was become general all over Europe, and was introduced into England after having introduced its appearance in other countries (E). In England, however, there have been several doubts and inquiries land, into England.\nquires among the learned concerning the introduction of the feudal laws. Many are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that they were first introduced by William the Conqueror; and consequently, that they were entirely unknown to the Anglo-Saxons: but others think, that they existed among the latter in the same form under which they were continued by the Normans. Dr Stuart is of opinion that the Saxons who settled in England could not be strangers to fiefs. He supposes the conformity of manners, which undoubtedly prevailed between the Saxons and other barbarians, a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that the hereditary grant of land, as well as the fluctuating state of feudal tenures which preceded it, were known to the former. Collateral proofs are derived from the spirit and tenure of the Anglo-Saxon laws, but especially from the grants of hereditary estates on condition of military service (f). The condition of fiefs under the Anglo-Saxons was very different from what it was afterwards. In their times we find no mention made of these oppressions of which so much notice has already been taken; and this may easily be accounted for from the alteration of the feudal spirit in different ages. During the time that a warm and generous affection subsisted between the feudal superiors and vassals, the incidents were marks of generosity on the one part, and gratitude on the other; but as soon as a variance had taken place, by reason of the interested disposition which the introduction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> produced, the same incidents became sources of the most flagrant oppression. This was remarkably the case in the time of William the Conqueror; and, during the reign of King John, matters were come to such a crisis, that the people everywhere complained loudly, and demanded the restoration of the laws of Edward the Confessor (c). \"What these laws of Edward the Confessor were (says Mr Hume), which the English every reign during a century and a half desired so passionately to have restored, is much disputed by antiquarians; and our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of them seems one of the greatest defects of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> English history.\" Dr Stuart has offered an explanation; but this is in fact no more than a conflation of conjecture, that \"by the laws or customs of the Confessor, then by that condition of felicity was expressed which had been enjoyed during the fortunate state of the feudal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a>. The cordiality, equality, and independence, which then prevailed among all ranks in society, continued to be remembered in less prosperous times, and occasioned an ardent desire for the revival of those laws and usages which were the sources of so much happiness.\"\n\nBesides the great distinction (of which an account Distinction has already been given) between the state of fiefs under concerning the Anglo-Saxons and under the Normans, they were fiefs in no less distinguished by the introduction of knight-service. Hitherto the refinement of the English had been obstructed by the invasion of the Danes, and the man times infaral situation of the kingdom; but after the Norman conquest the fiefs were made perpetual. Still, however, the knight-fee and knight-service were altogether unknown. William, the sixth prince who enjoyed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUCHY\">duchy</a> of Normandy, was well acquainted with every thing relating to fiefs; for that duchy had experienced all the variety incidental to them from the time of its being granted to Rollo by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> the Simple in the year 912, to the year 1066, when William was put in possession of England by the battle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HASTINGS\">Hastings</a>.\n\nOn his accession to the throne, a number of forfeitures took place among those who had followed the fortune of Harold. Their estates were to be disposed of at the pleasure of the conqueror; and it was natural to suppose that he would follow the method practised in\n\nwas known in Scotland, and that it was not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> at that time. The same author thinks it even probable, that it was known in the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> I.\n\n(f) The use of entails was known to the Anglo-Saxons; and this practice, as well as the succession to alodial estates, must have contributed very much to establish hereditary fiefs. This opinion seems also to be confirmed by the accounts we have of the great power of many of the nobility among the Anglo-Saxons, and the natural tendency that fiefs must have, in the course of things, to become perpetual, though analogical arguments cannot entirely be depended upon in this case. There is indeed positive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> that the territory which anciently constituted the kingdom of Mercia belonged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ETHELRED\">Ethelred</a> as an hereditary fief and carolm. The grant was given him by Alfred when he married his daughter Ethelfleda: and it is likewise attested by Camden, that in the time of Ethelred the earldom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEICESTER\">Leicester</a> was an inheritance, and the regular succession of its earls is still known. We are informed also by creditable historians, that Bernicia and Deireland were feudal and inheritable earldoms among the Saxons. The same was true of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a> when possessed by the Scottish monarchs. This last appears from the Saxon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRONICLE\">Chronicle</a>: in which the grant was conveyed by Edmund king of England to Malcolm of Scotland in the following terms: \"Edmundus rex totam Cumberland praedavit et contrivit, et commendavit eam Malcomo regi Scotiae; hoc pacto, quod in auxilio fibi foret terra et mari.\" From the use of the word commendavit, indeed, Spelman takes occasion to say, that a feudal homage was not intended; but the contrary may be proved by the original Saxon from which the foregoing is a Latin translation; and the word, according to several learned critics, signifies feudal homage with the most strict propriety. Thus Du Cange informs us, that commendare se aliqui was the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> for faire l'hommage a un suzerain.\n\n(g) The laws which are now extant under the name of Edward, are generally allowed to be of doubtful authenticity; nor are they, even supposing them to be genuine, of any use in answering the present question. They determine indeed the existence of fiefs among the Anglo-Saxons: and Dr Stuart is of opinion, that the compilation which goes under the name of this prince, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a> it bears, nevertheless merits greater attention than has usually been bestowed upon it. M. Honard, a foreign lawyer, is the latest writer who has made it his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>; but he is better acquainted with the Norman than the Anglo-Saxon customs.\nin his own country. Hence the origin of knight-service in England. A grant of land, to any person whatever, was estimated at a certain number of knights fees; and each of these required the service of a knight. The grants of lands were even renewed to the old tenants under this tenure; so that by degrees the whole military people in the kingdom acquiesced in it. To accomplish this, *Domesday Book*, is supposed to have been compiled, which contained an exact account of all the landed property of the kingdom.\u2014Hence it is to be concluded, not that William introduced fiefs into England, as some have imagined, but that he brought them to their ultimate state of perfection by the introduction of knight-service. This is evident from the laws enacted during his reign. In these it is not only mentioned that knight-service was enacted, but that it was done expressly with the consent of the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of the nation; which at that time was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> (H).\n\nThe invention of knight-service proved generally agreeable: for as only few of the Anglo-Saxon fiefs were hereditary, the advancement of the rest to perpetuity, under the tenure of knight-service, must have been accounted an acquisition of some importance; as not only augmenting the grandeur and dignity of the sovereign, but securing the independence of the subject, and improving his property. In the happy state of the feudal association, there was indeed no necessity for the knight\u2019s fee; but when the discordance and oppression so often mentioned began to take place, it became then necessary to point out particularly every duty of the vassal, as well as of the lord; and this was fully done by the invention of knight-service. The nobles possessed duchies, baronies, and earldoms; which extensive possessions were divided into as many fees, each of them to furnish a knight for the service of the king, or of the superior; so that every feudal state could command a numerous army and militia to support and defend it in case of any emergency. The knights were also bound to assemble in complete armour whenever the superior thought proper to call, and to hold themselves in readiness for action whenever the king or superior found it convenient to take the field: so that thus the militia might be marched at the shortest notice to defend or support the honour of the nation.\n\nThe knights were usually armed with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELMET\">helmet</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANCE\">lance</a>, and shield; and each was besides obliged to keep a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>. This last requisite was owing to the contempt into which the infantry had fallen through the prevalence of tournaments and luxuries of various kinds, though it was by means of the infantry that the barbarians had originally distinguished themselves in their wars with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, and became able to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPE\">cope</a> with the celebrated warriors. All proprietors of fees or tenants by knight-service fought on foot: the cavalry were distinguished by the name of battle; and the success of every encounter was supposed to depend on them alone. They only were completely armed; the infantry, being furnished by the villages under the jurisdiction of the barons, had at first only bows and lances; though afterwards they were found worthy of much greater attention.\n\nWhile the feudal association remained in perfection, its inefficacy and corruption was such that the superior could at any time command the military service of his vassals; but in the subsequent degeneracy this service could neither be depended upon when wanted, nor was it of the same advantage when obtained as formerly. The invention of knight-service tended in a great degree to remedy this inconvenience. Those who were possessed of knights fees were now obliged to remain 40 days in the field at their own expense; and this without exception, from the greatest crown vassals to the smallest feudatories; but if longer service was required, the prince was obliged to pay his troops. In those times, however, when the fate of nations was frequently decided by a single battle, a continuance in the field for 40 days was sufficient for ordinary occasions.\n\nThus matters seemed once more to be restored nearly to their former state. It was now, as much as ever, the interest of the nation to act with unanimity in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, not only against foreign enemies, but against the tyranny of the prince over his subjects, or of one part of the subjects over the other. New inconveniences, however, soon began to take place, owing to the gradual improvements in life and the refinement of manners. From the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> of military service, a fine had been accepted instead of actual appearance in the field. In the times of barbarity, however, when men accounted rapine and bloodshed their only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, there were but few who made an offer of this compensation; but as wealth and luxury increased, and the manners of people became softer, a general unwillingness of following the army into the field became also prevalent. A new tenure, called *efuage*, was therefore introduced, by which the vassal was only obliged to pay his superior a sum of money annually, instead of attending him into the field *. Hence originated taxes and their misapplication; for as the king was lord paramount of the whole kingdom, it thence happened that the whole efuage money collected under the throughout the nation centred in him. The princes and then, instead of recruiting their armies, frequently filled their coffers with the money, or dissipated it other-wise, hiring mercenaries to defend their territories when threatened with any danger. These being commanding posted of the chiefs of the people, and disbanded at the armies, &c.\n\n---\n\n(H) The following law of William the Conqueror not only makes express mention of the knight\u2019s fee and service, but alludes to a former law of William and his parliament, by which this tenure was actually established.\n\n\"Statutumus etiam et firmiter praecipimus, ut omnes comites, et barones, et milites, et servientes, et universi liberari homines totius regni nostri praedicti, habeant et teneant se semper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-BENE\">bene</a> in armis et in equis, ut decet et oportet, et quod sint semper prompti et bene parati <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a> servitium suum integrum nobis excludendum, et peragendum, dum, cum semper opus adhaerit, secundum quod nobis debent de feudis et tenementis suis de jure facere, et fit, ut illis statutumus per commune consilium totius regni nostri praedicti, et dedimus et concedimus in feodo jure hereditario.\" LL. Guill. c. 59.\nFeoffment end of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a>, filled all Europe with a disorderly banditti, who frequently proved very dangerous to society.

The necessities which arose from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> troubles compelled him to diminish the prices of his paintings in order to procure an immediate support; and as those necessities increased, his pictures were still more sunk in their price, though not in their intrinsic value.

His father's name was William, who, as well as the son, likewise paid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSES\">muses</a>; but he wisely relinquished the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> for the more certain emoluments of trade and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, being employed in different mercantile houses both in Edinburgh and Aberdeen. He was an accountant in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">Linen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a> when he died, but never acquired any thing like an independent fortune.\n\nThe subject of the present sketch was of a weak and delicate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> during infancy,\u2014indeed to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, that small hopes were entertained of his ever reaching the years of manhood. Yet such were the care and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of his parents, that he was able to attend an English school by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he was six years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, where his progress was considered as very extraordinary. It was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less rapid at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> school of Edinburgh, which he attended for years, acquiring a competent knowledge of the Latin tongue with very little labour <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> exertion. From that he went to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a> school of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUNDEE\">Dundee</a>, and in two years after to the university of St Andrews, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> his father preferred to Edinburgh, because a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> of the name of Ferguson had left two bursaries for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> of two boys of the same name.\nHis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> was never impaired at any time by fever or study; yet he kept alive at the university the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> which had been entertained of him while at school, and he was decidedly the first mathematician of the same standing. He was patronized by Dr Wilkie, professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, who was perhaps as much attached to him for his poetical as his mathematical talents, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> himself being a poet, and author of the Epigoniad. This kindness was repaid by Ferguson, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Dr Wilkie, by a beautiful elegy to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, written in the Scottish dialect. A little before he left the university, Ferguson had conceived the idea of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> a tragedy on the death of Sir William Wallace, for which he had collected materials; but as he afterwards met with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> on the same subject, he abandoned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, after he had completed two acts. His own reason for doing so he thus expressed, \"Whatever I publish shall be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>, and this tragedy might be considered as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a>.\"\n\nHe returned to Edinburgh when he had finished his studies, without having fixed on any particular employment; for although he was destined for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> by his father, on his death he paid little attention to the expectations of his mother. He declined also the study of physic, afflicting this as a reason, that when he read the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of diseases, he believed that he felt the symptoms of them all in himself. He was then induced to attempt the study of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, in which, as was natural to expect, he made no proficiency. He seems to have turned a willing eye to some lucrative place, to obtain which he paid a visit to an uncle who resided at Aberdeen, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of literature and opulence, hoping that through his influence he might be settled in some place suited to his merit. In this rational hope he was completely disappointed; for although his uncle shewed him every mark of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a>, his fondness decayed by degrees, and in six months he deprived him in an abrupt manner to leave his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, without attempting to procure for him any kind of living. It would perhaps be rash and uncandid to reprobate this conduct of his uncle, whose penetration probably beheld, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not the actual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>, at least the germinating seeds of those too fashionable vices and follies into which he afterwards plunged. We only give this as a conjecture of our own; but it seems to derive considerable countenance from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> between the manner in which his uncle received him, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of their separation. Be this as it may, the conduct of his uncle operated powerfully on the mind of Ferguson, which, with the fatigue of his journey back to Edinburgh, brought on him a feverish illness, on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> from which he composed two elegies; one on the decay of friendship, and the other against repining at fortune; both which were suggested by this adventure at Aberdeen. The disappointment of his hopes, and the effect it produced on his mind, are very evident from the following stanzas.\n\nBut, ah! these youthful sportive hours are fled,\nThese scenes of jocund mirth are now no more;\nNo healing slumber 'tend my humble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>,\nNo friends console the sorrows of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>.\n\nAnd what avail the thoughts of former joys?\nWhat comfort bring they in the adverse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>?\nCan they the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANKER\">canker</a>-worm of care destroy,\nOr brighten fortune's discontented lour?\n\nSo great were his necessities at this period, that he copied papers in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSARY\">commissary</a> clerk's office for so much per sheet, which employment he soon left in disgust.\n\nSo boundless was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>, which was only equalled by his good nature, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a>, and goodness of heart, that all who knew him received him with affection; but his powers of song and talents for mimicry often led him into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of the dissipated, whose example could not fail of doing him essential injury, but who had neither the power nor inclination to provide for him through life. The irregularities into which he was thus frequently led, often awakened upon him the dictates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>; and the conversation of a minister who understood his manner of life, made a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on his mind. In short, his remorse soon after assumed the appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> despair. His sprightliness entirely forsook him; but he gradually recovered from his delirium, and his health was fully restored.

Being sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, he applied himself in a most intense manner. All other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> was insipid to him. He cared neither for play nor for walking, nor for entertainments, nor even for conversation. He read Cicero, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> of Cicero procured him this advantage, that the lectures he read on philosophical subjects were as eloquent as those of the other masters were barbarous at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. He also applied himself very earnestly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>. This continual study drew upon him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> fit of sickness, which obliged him to leave Paris. On his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a>, he returned thither with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to study physic; but before he applied himself entirely to it, he taught philosophy in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARBARA\">Barbara</a>. After this he spent four years in the study of physic; and taking a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, confined himself to his closet, in order to read the best authors, and to improve himself in the mathematics; that is, as far as the business of his profession would suffer him. Never was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> more diligent than Fernel. He used to rise at four o'clock in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, and studied till it was time either to read lectures or to visit patients. He then examined the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> that was brought him; for this was the method of those times, with regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> people, who did not send for the physician. Coming home to dine, he shut himself up among his books till they called him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>. Rising from table, he returned to his study, which he did not leave without necessary occasions. Coming home at night, he did <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as at noon: he sat among his books till they called him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>; returned to them the moment he had supped; and did not leave them till eleven o'clock, when he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>. In the course of these studies, he contrived mathematical instruments, and was at great charges in making them. But his wife murmuring at the expense, he dismissed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>-makers, and applied himself in good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> to practice physic. But as visiting patients did not employ his whole time, he read public lectures upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a> and Galen. This soon gained him a great reputation through France and in foreign countries. His business increasing, he left off reading lectures; but as nothing could make him cease to study in private, he spent all the hours he could spare in composing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of physic, entitled Physiologia, which was soon after published. He was prevailed with to read lectures upon this new work, which he did for three years; and undertaking another work, which he published, De venae sectione, he laid himself under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of reading lectures some years longer, in order to explain this new book to the youth. While he was thus employed, he was sent for to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, in order to try whether he could cure a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>, whose recovery was despaired of. He was so happy as to cure her; which was the first cause of that esteem which Henry II. who was then but dauphin, and was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> with that lady, conceived for him. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> offered him, even then, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of first physician to him; but Fernel, who infinitely preferred his studies to the hurry of a court, would not accept the employment. When Henry came to the throne, he renewed his entreaties; but Fernel represented that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> which was offered to him was due, for several reasons, and as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, to the late king's physician; and that, as for himself, he wanted some time to make experiments concerning several discoveries he had made relating to physic. The king admitted this; but as soon as Francis I.'s physician died, Fernel was obliged to go and fill his place at Henry II.'s court. And here just the contrary to what he dreaded came to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>; for he enjoyed more rest and more leisure at court than he had done at Paris; and he might have considered the court as an agreeable retirement, had it not been for the journeys which the new civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> obliged the king to take. He died in 1558, leaving behind him a great many works, besides what have been mentioned; as, De abditiis rerum causis, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> books of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATHOLOGY\">Pathology</a>, a book on Remedies, &c.

The surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> consists of a shallow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> of remarkable fertility; for barley, the only corn grown here, yields above 20 for one; and the grass affords abundant pastureage for sheep. The exports are, salted mutton and tallow, goose quills, feathers, and eider <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>; and,\nby the industry of the inhabitants, knit woollen waistcoats, caps, and stockings. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> trees beyond the size of juniper or fluted willows <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> grow here; nor are any wild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a> to be met with except rats and mice, originally escaped from the shipping. Vast quantities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> fowl frequent the rocks; and the taking of them furnishes a very perilous employment to the natives, as described under the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">Bird</a>-Catching.\n\nThe sea which surrounds these islands is extremely turbulent. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> vary greatly on the western and eastern sides. On the first, where is received the uninterrupted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a> of the ocean from the remote <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENLAND\">Greenland</a>, the tide rises <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> fathoms; on the eastern side it rises only three. Dreadful whirlwinds, called by the Danes oes, agitate the sea to a strange <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>; catch up a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, so as to leave a great temporary chasm in the spot on which it falls, and carries away with it, to an amazing distance, any fishes which may happen to be within reach of its fury. Thus great shoals of herrings have been found on the highest mountains of Feroe. It is equally irresistible on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>; tearing up trees, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, and animals, and carrying them to very distant places.\n\nAmong the numerous whirlpools of these seas, that of Suderoe, near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of the same name, is the most noted. It is occasioned by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRATER\">crater</a> 61 fathoms in depth in the centre, and from 50 to 55 on the sides. The water forms four fierce circumferences. The point they begin at is on the side of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> basin, where commences a range of rocks running spirally, and terminating at the verge of the crater. This range is extremely rugged, and covered with water from the depth of 12 to 8 fathoms only. It forms four equidistant wreaths with a channel from 35 to 20 fathoms in depth between each. On the outside, beyond that depth, the sea suddenly sinks to 80 and 90. On the south border of the basin is a lofty rock, called Sumbroe Munk, noted for the multitude of birds which frequent it. On one side, the water is only 3 or 4 fathoms deep; on the other 15. The danger at most times, especially in storms, is very great. Ships are irresistibly drawn in; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUDDER\">rudder</a> loses its power; and the waves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASTS\">masts</a>; so that an escape is almost miraculous; yet at the reflux, and in very still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, the inhabitants will venture in boats for the sake of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a>.\n\nInnumerable flocks of aquatic birds are continually to be seen perched on the extremities of the rocks, which make their nests in the clefts above the precipices; and vast numbers of them may be killed by the discharge of a single musket, and the rest will not stir, so little are they accustomed to be disturbed. One of the islands contains but a single habitation, which can be visited by the curate only in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>. In the southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of these islands coal-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> were discovered about the beginning of the eighteenth century, and trials of the coals were only made in 1777, when it was judged that working them would be of sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARRY\">quarry</a> was determined by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSARY\">commissary</a> to be about 12,000 feet long, 4000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> on a medium, and five feet deep; but to great did the difficulty of working it appear, that the idea was abandoned. The coals were analyzed by the celebrated professor Kratzenstein of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPENHAGEN\">Copenhagen</a>, who found that they were superior to those of England, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> longer, and giving a more intense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, but not so easily kindled. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> of them has been made in Scotland, and they are allowed to be of a superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. It is a favourable circumstance to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a> of the produce of these islands, that their harbours are never frozen, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> of consequence could meet with no interruption during the winter.\n\nThe measles and smallpox never attack the inhabitants but when they are brought there by strangers, when the ravages they make are almost as terrible as those of the pestilence; but for 70 years back they have not been subjected to this dreadful visitation. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is temperate, and neither too hot in summer, nor extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> in winter. There are frequent mists on these islands, but they do not seem to be injurious to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> of the inhabitants. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> often blows with such violence, that the people on horseback are obliged to dismount at its approach, which is announced by a whistling across the rocks; and persons on foot must throw themselves flat on their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, to avoid the dreadful consequences of the irresistible hurricane. So sudden is its approach at some times, that a burning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> might be carried in the open air but a few seconds before it. There is seldom any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> on these islands; but when the phenomenon does happen, its awful and incessant roar among the rocks is truly alarming. Potatoes, the cultivation of which is rapidly advancing, thrive well, and the same is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with radishes and turnips. Corn is not much cultivated, which would require excessive labour in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> so mountainous, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> fishery requires all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> that can be spared. Trees cannot be made to grow upon them, and of consequence there is no wood.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of inhabitants does not exceed 5000; and they are in general well made, with fair complexions, and their whiteness is very seldom impaired by the influence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>. They are not deficient in understanding; and although phlegmatic, yet they are benevolent and hospitable, and are seldom known to quarrel. They are fond of brandy, and yet it is said that they are very rarely seen in a state of intoxication. They are frugal and upright, yet extremely credulous, and much addicted to superstitious practices. There are no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> among them, as parents educate their own children, and their knowledge of consequence is very circumscripted. They abound in skilful players at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHESS\">chess</a>, but are wholly unacquainted with instruments of music, and dance to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>.","sp":222,"ep":223},{"h":"FERONIA","t":"the Pagan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GODDESS\">goddess</a> of woods and orchards.

In the middle of the city is a magnificent castle, which was formerly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of the dukes, and is now the least ornament of Ferrara. It is quite surrounded with water; and the arsenal, which is near it, deserves the observation of travellers.

This is owing to the exactions of the popes. The fortifications are now neglected, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> university is dwindled into a wretched <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> of the Jesuits. However, in 1735, it was advanced to an archbishopric by Pope Clement XII.

This country is almost surrounded by the branches of the Po, which often overflow the country, and form the great morass of Comacchio, which has a bad effect on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>.

It is described as a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, surrounded with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> walls, within which there are hills and valleys, only the middle being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> and flat. The river, which runs through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, is divided into two streams, from which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> are cut into every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the town; so that the mosques, colleges, palaces, and the houses of great men, are amply supplied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. They have generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> marble basins in the middle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of their houses, which are supplied with water by marble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through the walls. They constantly run over, and the stream returns back into the street, and so into the river. The houses are built with brick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>; and are adorned on the outside with fine mosaic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, or tiles like those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>. The wood work and ceilings are carved, painted and gilt. The roofs are flat; for they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> on the tops of the houses in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>. Most of the houses\nhouses are two stories high, and some three. There are plazas and galleries running all round the court on the inside, so that you may wander cover from one apartment to another. The pillars are of brick, covered with glazed tiles, or of marble, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> between. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> work is carved and painted with gay colours, and most of the rooms have marble cisterns of water. Some of the great men build towers over their houses several stories high, and spare <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> expense to render them beautiful; from hence they have a fine prospect all over the city.\n\nThere are in this city 700 mosques, great and small; 50 of which are magnificent, and supported with marble pillars, and other ornaments. The floors are covered with mats, as well as the walls to the height of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>. Every mosque has a tower or minaret, like those in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a>, with a gallery on the top, from whence they call the people to prayers. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> mosque is near a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> and a half in circumference. The middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> is 150 yards in length, and 80 in breadth, with a tower proportionally high. Round this to the east, west, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, there are great colonnades 30 or 40 yards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>. There are 900 lamps lighted every night; and in the middle of the mosque are large branches, which are capable of holding 500 lamps each. Along the walls are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> pulpits, from which the doctors of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> teach the people. The business of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> is only to read prayers, and distribute alms to the people; to support which, there are large revenues.\n\nBesides the mosques, there are two colleges built in the Moorish manner, and adorned with marble and paintings. In one of them there are 100 rooms, besides a magnificent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a>. In this there is a great marble vase full of water, adorned with marble pillars of various colours, and finely polished. The capitals are gilt, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> shines with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, azure, and purple. The walls are adorned with Arabic verses in gold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>. The other colleges are not near so beautiful, or rather are all gone to ruin since the neglect of learning.\n\nThere are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a> in the city, where formerly all strangers were maintained three days gratis. But the estates belonging to them have been confiscated for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. There are above 100 public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a>, many of which are stately buildings. People of the same trade or business live in streets by themselves.\n\nThough the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> about Fez is pleasant and fertile, and in many places abounding with corn and cattle, yet a great part of it lies waste and uncultivated, not so much for want of inhabitants as from the oppression of the governors; which makes the people choose to live at some distance from the high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>, where they cultivate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> as is necessary for their own subsistence.\n\nRound the city there are fine marble tombs, monuments, and gardens full of all manner of fruit trees.\n\nSuch are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> accounts of this city. The following are given by M. Chenier, in his Recherches Historiques sur les Maures.\n\nFez was built in the end of the eighth century by Edris, a descendant of Mahomet and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALI\">Ali</a>; whose father, in order to avoid the proclivities of the caliph <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABDALLAH\">Abdallah</a>, retired to the extremity of Africa, and was proclaimed sovereign by the Moors. Sidy Edris, having succeeded to the throne of his father, built the city of Fez in the year 793. He caused a mosque to be erected, in which his body was interred, and the city ever afterwards became an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a> for the Moors, and a place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>. In the first moments of fervour which a new worship inspires, another mosque was built called caroub, which is perhaps one of the largest and most beautiful edifices in Africa. Several others were successively built, besides colleges and hospitals; and the city was held in such veneration, that when the pilgrimage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECCA\">Mecca</a> was interrupted in the fourth century of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEGIRA\">Hegira</a>, the western Mahometans substituted that of Fez in its stead, while the eastern people went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>.\n\nWhen the Arabs had spread <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, Africa, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, they brought to Fez the little knowledge they had acquired in the sciences and arts; and that capital conjoined, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">academies</a> where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> was taught, together with medicine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>. This last gradually degenerated; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> brought astrology into repute, and this quickly engendered the arts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGIC\">magic</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINATION\">divination</a>.\n\nFez soon became the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> of all Africa. The Mahometans went thither for the purposes of devotion; the affluence of strangers introduced a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>; libertinism quickly followed; and, as its progress is most rapid in warm countries, Fez, which had been the nurse of sciences and arts, became a harbour for every kind of vice. The public baths, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, cleanliness, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, had rendered necessary, and which were everywhere respected as sacred places, became scenes of debauchery; where men introduced themselves in the habits of women; youths in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a>, with a dittoff in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, walked the streets at sunset in order to entice strangers to their inns, which were less a place of repose than a convenience for prostitution.\n\nThe usurpers who disputed the kingdom of Fez after the 16th century overlooked these abuses, and contented themselves with subjecting the masters of the inns to furnish a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-COOKS\">cooks</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>. It is to this laxity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> that Fez owed its first splendour. As the inhabitants are beautiful, the Africans flocked thither in crowds; the laws were overturned, morals despised, and vice itself turned into an engine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> resource. The same spirit, the same inclinations, the same depravity, still exist in the hearts of all the Moors. But libertinism is not now encouraged; it wears there, as in other places, the mask of hypocrisy; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DARES\">dares</a> not venture to show itself in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>.\n\nThe Mahometans of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANDALUSIA\">Andalusia</a>, those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANADA\">Granada</a> and Cordova, migrated to Fez during the different revolutions that agitated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>: they carried with them new customs and new arts, and perhaps some slight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of civilization. The Spanish Moors carried from Cordova to Fez the art of staining goat and sheep skins with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, which were then called Cordova <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>, and now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOROCCO\">Morocco</a> leather, from that city where the art is less perfect. They manufacture gauzes at Fez, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> stuffs, and girdles elegantly embroidered with gold and silk, which show how far their ingenuity might be carried <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> industry were more encouraged.\n\nThere is still some taste for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> preserved at Fez, and the Arabic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> is spoken there in greater purity.\npurity than in any other part of the empire. The rich Moors send their children to the schools at Fez, where they are better instructed than they could be elsewhere.\n\nLeo Africanus, in the 16th century, gave a magnificent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of this city, from which most of those that have been afterwards made are copied; but its situation, its schools, and the industry and great urbanity of its inhabitants, are the only circumstances that give it any preference to the other cities of the empire. There are some pretty convenient inns here, consisting of two or three stories. The houses have no elegance externally: the streets are ill paved, and so strait that two persons riding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABREAST\">abreast</a> can hardly pass. The shops are like stalls; and have no more room in them than is sufficient to serve for the owner, who is always seated with his wares around him, which he shows to the passengers. But though the Moors of Fez are more civilized than the rest, they are vain, superstitious, and intolerant; and an order must be obtained from the emperor before a Christian or a Jew can be allowed to enter the city.\n\nThe situation of Fez is exceedingly singular. It lies in the bottom of a valley surrounded by little hills in the shape of a funnel; the declivities are divided into gardens planted with tall trees, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>, and all sorts of fruit trees; a river meanders along the declivity, and turns a number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a>, which distribute the water abundantly to all the gardens, and almost to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> to the city, which stands in the centre, is long; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> lies through these gardens, which it traverses, in a serpentine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>.\n\nThe gardens, seen from the city, form a most delightful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMPHITHEATRE\">amphitheatre</a>. Formerly each garden had a house in which the inhabitants spent the summer. These houses were destroyed in the times of the civil wars, and in the revolutions to which Fez has been subject, and few individuals have restored them. The situation of Fez, however, cannot be healthful; moist vapours fill the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> in summer, and fevers are exceedingly common.\n\nOn the height above Fez, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> susceptible of rich cultivation, stands New Fez, finely situated, and enjoying excellent air, containing some old palaces, in which the children of the emperor live, and where he sometimes resides himself. New Fez is inhabited by some Moorish families, but by a greater number of Jews.\n\nFez is seated on the river Cebu, W. Long. 4\u00b0 25'. N.

It is bounded on the east by the Harutich and line of the deserts; by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> of the Tibboes on the south and south-east; by that of the Nomadic Tuaregs on the south-west; and the country which forms the western boundary, is inhabited by Arabs. It contains 101 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> and villages, of which Mourzouk is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> of this kingdom is neither temperate nor agreeable at any season whatever; for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> is almost intolerable, even to the inhabitants, especially when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> blows from the south; and the prevalence of the north wind during winter makes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> so intense, as not only to chill the natives, but those also who visit it from northern Fezzan regions.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">Rain</a> falls but seldom in this country, and in very small quantities. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">Thunder</a> is also a rare phenomenon: Mr Horneman affirms us that there was not a single storm from November 1798 to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1799; and that on the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1799 there were some faint flashes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a> unaccompanied by any claps of thunder. Winds, however, blow very frequently, both from the north and south, whirling up the dust and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> in such a manner as to give the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> a yellowish appearance. There is neither river nor rivulet of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> in the whole country, according to Mr Horneman, who informs us that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is a deep sand, beneath which is found calcareous rock <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and sometimes a stratum of an argillaceous subfusance.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">Date</a> trees may be considered as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> production of Fezzan, in the western parts of which some fenana grows, of a superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> to that which is imported from the country of the Tibboes. Culinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, and almost every vegetable peculiar to the garden, are met with in abundance. Wheat and barley seem well adapted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the soil, as well as to the climate; yet corn is not raised in sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> for home consumption, which is brought from those parts of Africa bordering on the northern parts of the kingdom. This is most probably owing to the native indolence of the people, the despotism of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, and the difficulties inseparable from their peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of tillage.\n\nThey bestow little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> on the rearing of cattle, which are only found in the most fertile parts of the country, and even in these their numbers are but small. They are made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of to draw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELLS\">wells</a>, and are never killed but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> animal is the goat; and although sheep are reared in the southern parts of the country, the most abundant supply is furnished by the Arabs on the borders. They make coarse cloths of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, which constitute the apparel of the inhabitants in general. Their horses are not numerous, as they make most use of asses, either for carriage, draught, or burthen. Camels bear a most extravagant price, being only made use of by the higher ranks, or by opulent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>; and the common food of all those animals is the fruit of the date tree.\n\nAlthough the trade of Fezzan consists entirely of foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>, it is nevertheless considerable. Mourzouk is the great market and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> for different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARAVANS\">caravans</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a>, Bengasi, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIPOLI\">Tripoli</a>, and other places, between the months of October and February. The caravans which come to Mourzouk from the west or south, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> in ostrich feathers, tiger skins, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> dust, and also in furs of both sexes as articles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">Tobacco</a> and snuff, with other articles manufactured in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a>, are brought to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> by the merchants from Bengasi; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, fire-arms, sabres, knives, and woollen cloth, are conveyed to it from Tripoli.\n\nFezzan is governed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SULTAN\">sultan</a>, a descendant of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of the Sheriffs; and according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> of the country, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> came from the western parts of Africa, invaded and made a conquest of it about 500 years ago. He reigns over his dominions with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">ab</a>-\nFezzan. Solute power, but is at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> tributary to the bailhaw of Tripoli, who annually receives from him the sum of 4000 dollars by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of an officer appointed for that purpose. The sultan who was upon the throne when Mr Horne <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> in 1798 visited the country, assumed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of \"Sultan Muhammed ben Sultan Manfur,\" engraved on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a> which is applied to all public acts, and also to correspondence within his dominions; but he makes use of a smaller seal when he writes to the bailhaw of Tripoli. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>; yet it descends not in all cases from father to son, for when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> dies, a nephew may succeed in preference to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> son, which is frequently the occasion of much bloodshed, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of succession comes to be warmly contested. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of the sultan is within the walls of the fortress of the capital, where he leads a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of retirement attended by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUNUCHS\">eunuchs</a>. The harem is near the palace, into which he never enters, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> whom he inclines to see is conducted to his apartment. The harem consists of the sultana and about 40 female slaves, which last he frequently dispenses of, and replaces them by others, unless they bear him children, or become the objects of his ardent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a>, either by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> or other accomplishments.\n\nThose who wish for an audience with the sultan, approach the throne, which is an old elbow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> raised a few steps from the ground, kiss his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and raise it so as to touch their forehead, and then kneel before him to give a statement of their business in common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, taking care, however, to intermix it with such exclamations as these: \"God prolong thy life, God protect thy country,\" and to offer him some small present. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of the sultan consists of a first and second minister, the general of his forces, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, and a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> slaves. Some of the black slaves who are purchased while boys, and educated according to their distinctions and talents, often acquire considerable influence with the sultan.\n\nThe dress of the sultan, when he appears in state, consists of a white frock of stuff, ornamented with gold and silver, and sometimes of satin interwoven with silver. The appearance of his turban is remarkable, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> not less than three feet from the fore to the hinder <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>, and two feet in breadth. His revenue arises from certain taxes on all gardens and cultivated lands, and from fines and requisitions imposed in an arbitrary manner. The slaves who are employed in collecting these are often rigorous in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a>, but it is often possible to procure their lenity by means of a bribe. The expenditure of this revenue is chiefly confined to the support of the sultan, his court and palace, for the cadi and department of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> order, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> officers of government, are supported by the produce of date-tree woods and gardens.\n\nThe administration of justice is vested in the hands of a cadi, whose decisions are guided by the Mohammedan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, by antiquated customs, and established practice; but judgment in all criminal cases is purely arbitrary, or is referred to the sultan. The office of cadi has been hereditary in one family, ever since the conquest of the country by the ancestors of the present sultan; and when he dies, his place is filled up by one who is most eminent for learning, or who can best read and write, which is all the learning that he is ever possessed of.\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain anything like an accurate statement of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of Fezzan, but Mr Horne man conjectures that they may amount to about 75,000, all of them professing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of Mahomet. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> of the people varies considerably; those in the northern parts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> in this respect a striking resemblance to the Arabians, while those in the southern districts are very much like the Tibboes and Tuaregs. Those who are strictly indigenous are of ordinary stature, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a> far from being muscular; of a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, short black <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> formed like the people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, and their nose not so flat as that of the negro. Their walk, mein and gesture, indicate a total want of energy, either of body or mind.\n\nThe women of this country are in general fond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a>, and the wanton manners and public freedoms in which they are permitted to indulge, are frequently astonishing, even to Mahometans from other countries; and the men are very much addicted to the vice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRUNKENNESS\">drunkenness</a>, using the juice of the date-tree, or a drink that is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAYA\">baya</a>, which is of an intoxicating nature.\n\nDifferent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of the venereal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> prevail in this country, but that which is brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUDAN\">Soudan</a> is reckoned the most virulent. The common lues venerea is called franzi, for the cure of which they make use of salts and colocynth as powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHARTICS\">cathartics</a>, healing the sores with natron water or dissolved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SODA\">soda</a>. They are sometimes afflicted with hemorrhoids, the cure of which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> doubt rendered more difficult by the too liberal use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>; and a fever and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGUE\">ague</a> which are very pernicious to foreigners. They are entirely unacquainted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHLEBOTOMY\">phlebotomy</a>, yet they sometimes draw blood by means of cupping; and some are as much acquainted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURGERY\">surgery</a> as to be able to cure a simple fracture.\n\nTheir houses are miserable structures, composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> or bricks mixed with clay, and dried in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, and the hands of the labourer are all the tools which are employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>. When the walls are finished, they are covered over with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a> made of calcareous earth, which is also done with the hand. Their houses are extremely low, and there is no other entrance for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> but by the door. They are uncommonly abstemious in respect of diet. Indeed they can never abstain from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTCHER\">butcher</a> meat when it is placed before them; but this is not an article of food with the generality, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> for a rich man is, \"that he eats <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> and meat every day.\"\n\nFEWEL.

They were of various forms, and often adorned with precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>. Men and women wore them in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> and at their shoes. Players and musicians, by way of preserving the voices of children put under their care to learn their arts, used to keep clothe the prepuce with a fibula, lest they should have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> with women.\n\nFicinus, Marsilius, a celebrated Italian, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a> in 1433, and educated at the expense of Laurence de Medicis. He attained a perfect knowledge of the Greek and Latin tongues, and became a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, a great physician, and a great divine. He was in the highest favour with Laurence and Cosmo de Medicis, who made him a canon of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Florence. He applied himself intensely to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>; and while others were striving who should be the deepest read in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, who was then the philosopher in fashion, he devoted himself wholly to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>. He was indeed the first who restored the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATONIC\">Platonic</a> philosophy in the west; for the better effecting of which he translated into Latin the whole works of Plato. There goes a story, but we know not how true it is, that when he had finished his translation, he communicated it to his friend Marcus Maturus, to have his approbation of it; but that, Maturus disliking it, he did it all over again. He next translated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOTINUS\">Plotinus</a>; and afterwards the works, or part of them at least, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCLUS\">Proclus</a>, Jamblicus, Porphyrius, and other celebrated Platonists.\u2014In his younger years, Ficinus lived like a philosopher; and too much so, as is said, to the neglect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>. However, Savonarola coming to Florence, Ficinus went with every body else to hear his sermons; and while he attended them for the sake of the preacher's eloquence, he imbibed a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, and devoted himself henceforward more especially to the duties of it. He died at Correggio in 1499; and as Baronius assures us upon the testimony of what he calls credible authors, appeared immediately after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> to his friend Michael Mercatus: to whom, it seems, he had promised to appear, in order to confirm what he had taught concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>. His writings, sacred and profane, which are very numerous, were collected and printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> in 1516, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASIL\">Basil</a> in 1561 and 1576, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> 1641, in two vols. folio.

Some of these trees are of amazing size and great extent, as they are continually increasing, and, contrary to most other things in animal and vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, they seem to be exempted from decay. Every branch from the main body throws out its own roots; at first, in small tender fibres, several yards from the ground; these continually grow thicker until they reach the surface; and there striking in, they increase to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> trunks, and become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> trees, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> out new branches from the top; these in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> suspend their roots, which, swelling into trunks, produce other branches; thus continuing in a state of progression as long as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, the first parent of them all, contributes her sustenance. The Hindoos are particularly fond of the Banian tree; they look upon it as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMBLEM\">emblem</a> of the Deity, from its long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, its outstretching arms, and overshadowing beneficence; they almost pay it divine honours, and\n\nFind a fane in every sacred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROVE\">grove</a>.\n\nNear these trees the most esteemed pagodas are generally erected; under their shade the Brahmins spend their lives in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> solitude; and the natives of all castes and tribes are fond of reclining in the cool recesses, beautiful walks, and lovely vistas of this unbraggious canopy, impervious to the hottest beams of a tropical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>.\n\nA remarkable large tree of this kind grows on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> in the river Nerbudda, ten miles from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Baroche in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Guzerat; a flourishing settlement lately in possession of the East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a>, but ceded by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a>, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> of peace concluded with the Mahattas in 1783,\nto Mahadajee Scindia a Mahratta <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a>. It is distinguished by the name of Cubbeer Burr, which was given it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of a famous saint. It was once much larger than at present; but high floods have carried away the banks of the island where it grows, and with them such parts of the tree as had thus far extended their roots: yet what remains is about 2000 feet in circumference, measured round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> stems; the overhanging branches, not yet struck <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, cover a much larger space. The chief trunks of this single tree (which in size greatly exceed our English elms and oaks), amount to 350; the smaller stems, forming into stronger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPORTERS\">supporters</a>, are more than 3000; and every one of these is calling out new branches, and hanging roots, in time to form trunks, and become the parents of a future progeny. Cubbeer Burr is famed throughout Hindostan for its great extent and surpassing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>: the Indian armies generally encamp around it; and, at stated seasons, solemn jatarras, or Hindu festivals, are held there, to which thousands of votaries repair from various parts of the Mogul empire.\u2014It is said that 7000 persons find ample room to repose under its shade. The English gentlemen, on their hunting and shooting parties, used to form extensive encampments, and spend weeks together under this delightful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAVILION\">pavilion</a>, which is generally filled with green wood pigeons, doves, peacocks, and a variety of feathered songsters; crowded with families of monkeys performing their antics tricks; and shaded by bays of a large size, many of them measuring upwards of six feet from the extremity of one wing to the other. This tree not only affords shelter, but sustenance, to all its inhabitants, being covered amid its bright foliage with small figs of a rich scarlet, on which they all regale with as much delight, as the lords of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> on their more costly fare in their parties.","sp":228,"ep":230},{"h":"FIDDES","t":"RICHARD, a learned divine and polite writer, was born in 1671, and educated at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>.

See Painting.\n\nFigure, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>, is applied to the various designs represented or wrought on velvets, damasks, taffettes, satins, and other stuffs and cloths.\n\nThe most usual figures for such designs are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> imitated from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; or grotesques, and compartments of pure fancy. Representations of men, beasts, birds, and landscapes, have only been introduced since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for the Chinese stuffs, particularly those called Sureer, began to prevail among us. It is the woof of the stuff that forms the figures; the warp only serves for the ground. In working figured stuffs there is required a person to show the workman how far he must raise the threads of the warp, to represent the figure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> with the woof, which is to be passed across between the threads thus raised. This former call <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> the design.\n\nFor the figures on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAPESTRY\">tapestry</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROCADE\">brocade</a>, &c. see Tapestry, &c.\n\nFor those given by the calendars, printers, &c. see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALENDAR\">Calendar</a>, &c.\n\nFigure, in Logic, denotes a certain order and disposition of the middle term in any syllogism.\n\nFigures are fourfold. 1. When the middle term is the subject of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">major</a> proposition, and the predicate of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a>, we have what is called the first figure. 2. When the middle term is the predicate of both the premises, the syllogism is said to be in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> figure. 3. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the middle term is the subject of the two premises, the syllogism is in the third figure: and lastly, by making it the predicate of the major, and subject of the minor, we obtain syllogisms in the fourth figure. Each of these figures has a determinate number of moods, including all the possible ways in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> differing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> or quality can be combined, according to any disposition of the middle term, in order to arrive at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> conclusion. See Logic.\n\nFigure, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>. See Oratory; also Allegory, Apostrophe, Hyperbole, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHOR\">Metaphor</a>, Personification, &c.\n\nA Figure, the means or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> conceived to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>. When we survey a number of connected objects, that which makes the greatest figure employs chiefly our attention; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a> it raises, if lively, prompts us even to exceed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> in the conceptions we form of it. Take the following examples.\nFor Neleus' Ion Alcides' rage had slain.\nA broken rock the force of Pirus threw.\n\nIn these instances, the rage of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a> and the force of Pirus, being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> circumstances, are so far exalted as to be conceived the agents that produce the effects.\n\nIn the first of the following instances, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a> being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> circumstance in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, is itself imagined to be the patient.\n\nWhose hunger has not tasted food these three days.\n\nAs when the force\nOf subterranean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> transports a hill.\n\nParadise Lost.\n\nAs when the potent rod\nOf Amram's son, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>'s evil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>,\nWav'd round the coast, upcall'd a pitchy cloud\nOf locusts.\n\nParadise Lost.\n\nA Figure, which, among related objects, extends the properties of one to another. This figure is not dignified with a proper name, because it has been overlooked by writers. Giddy brink, jovial wine, daring wound, are examples of this figure. Here are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADJECTIVES\">adjectives</a> that cannot be made to signify any quality of the substantives to which they are joined: a brink, for example, cannot be termed giddy in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>, either proper or figurative, that can signify any of its qualities or attributes.\n\nWhen we examine attentively the expression, we discover, that a brink is termed giddy from producing that effect in those who stand on it; in the same manner, a wound is said to be daring, not with respect to itself, but with respect to the boldness of the person who inflicts it: and wine is said to be jovial, as inspiring mirth and jollity. Thus the attributes of one subject are extended to another with which it is connected; and the expression of such a thought must be considered as a figure, because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> is not applicable to the subject in any proper sense.\n\nHow are we to account for this figure, which we see lies in the thought, and to what principle shall we refer it? Have poets a privilege to alter the nature of things, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> to bestow attributes upon a subject to which they do not belong? It is observed, that the mind passeth easily and sweetly along a train of connected objects; and, where the objects are intimately connected, that it is disposed to carry along the good or bad properties of one to another; especially when it is in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> inflamed with these properties. From this principle is derived the figure under consideration. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">Language</a>, invented for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of thought, would be imperfect, if it were not expressive even of the slightest propensities and more delicate feelings: but language cannot remain so imperfect among a people who have received any polish; because language is regulated by internal feeling, and is gradually improved to express whatever passes in the mind. Thus for example, when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of a coward is termed a coward sword, the expression is significative of an internal operation; for the mind, in passing from the agent to its instrument, is disposed to extend to the latter the properties of the former. Governed by the same principle, we say liftening fear, by extending the attribute liftening of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> who listens, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> with which he is moved.\n\nIn the expression bold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a>, or audax facinus, we extend to the effect what properly belongs to the cause. But not to waste <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> by making a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMENTARY\">commentary</a> upon every expression of this kind, the best way to give a complete view of the subject, is to exhibit a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> of the different relations that may give occasion to this figure. And in viewing the table, it will be observed, that the figure can never have any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> but where the relations are of the most intimate kind.\n\n1.

The progress from cause to effect is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> and easy; the opposite progress resembles retrograde <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>; and therefore panting height, afflonted thought, are strained and uncouth expressions, which a writer of taste will avoid.\n\nIt is not least strained, to apply to a subject in its present state, an epithet that may belong to it in some future state:\n\nSubmersaque obnue puppes.

The figurative sense must have a relation to that which is proper; and the more intimate the relation is, the figure is the more happy. How ornamental this figure is to language, will not be readily imagined by any one who hath not given peculiar attention; and therefore we shall endeavour to unfold its capital beauties and advantages. In the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, a word used figuratively, or in a new sense, suggests at the same time the sense it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> bears; and thus it has the effect to present two objects; one signified by the figurative sense, which may be termed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>; and one signified by the proper sense, which may be termed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCESSORY\">accessory</a>; the principal makes a part of the thought; the accessory is merely ornamental. In this respect, a figure of speech is precisely similar to concordant sounds in music, which, without contributing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELODY\">melody</a>, make it harmonious.\n\nTo explain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> by examples. Youth, by a figure of speech, is termed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of life: This expression signifies youth, the principal object which enters into the thought; it suggests, at the same time, the proper sense of morning; and this accessory object, being in itself beautiful, and connected by resemblance to the principal object, is not a little ornamental. Imperious ocean is an example of a different kind, where an attribute is expressed figuratively: Together with stormy, the figurative meaning of the epithet imperious, where is suggested its proper meaning, viz., the stern authority of a despotic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>; and these two are strongly connected by resemblance. Upon this figurative power of words, Vida descants with elegance, Poet. lib. iii. l. 44.\n\nIn the next place, this figure possesses a signal power of aggrandizing an object, by the following means.\u2014Words, which have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> but what arises from their sound, acquire an adventitious beauty from their meaning: a word signifying anything that is agreeable, becomes by that means agreeable; for the agreeableness of the object is communicated to its name. This acquired beauty, by the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, adheres to the word even when used figuratively; and the beauty received from the thing it properly signifies, is communicated to the thing which it is made to signify figuratively. Consider the foregoing expression Imperious ocean, how much more elevated it is than Stormy ocean.\n\nThirdly, This figure hath a happy effect by preventing the familiarity of proper names. The familiarity of a proper name is communicated to the thing it signifies by means of their intimate connexion; and the thing is thereby brought down in our feeling. This bad effect is prevented by using a figurative word instead of one that is proper: as for example, when we express the sky by terming it the blue vault of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>; for though no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of art can compare with the sky in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>, the expression however is relished, because it prevents the object from being brought down by the familiarity of its proper name. With respect to the degrading the familiarity of proper names, Vida has the following passage:\n\nHinc si dura mihi paffus dicendus Ulysses,\nNon illum vero memorabo nomine, sed qui\nEt mores hominum multorum vidit, et urbes,\nNaufragus everfice poft fveva incendia Trojae.\nPoet. lib. ii. l. 460.\n\nLastly, By this figure, language is enriched, and rendered more copious; in which respect, were there no other, a figure of speech is a happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>. This property is finely touched by Vida; Poet. lib. iii. l. 90.\n\nThe beauties we have mentioned belong to every figure of speech. Several other beauties, peculiar to one or other sort, we shall have occasion to remark afterward.\n\nNot only subjects, but qualities, actions, effects, may be expressed figuratively. Thus, as to subjects, gates of breath for the lips, the watery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> for the ocean. As to qualities, fierce for stormy, in the expression Fierce winter; allus for profound, Altus puteus, Altum mare;\nFigure. mare; breathing for perspiring, Breathing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>. Again, as to actions, The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> rages, Time will melt her frozen thoughts, Time kills grief. An effect is put for the cause, as lux for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>; and a cause for the effect, as bonum laboris for corn. The relation of resemblance is one plentiful source of figures of speech; and nothing is more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> than to apply to one object the name of another that resembles it in any respect: Height, size, and worldly greatness, resemble not each other; but the emotions they produce resemble each other, and, prompted by this resemblance, we naturally express worldly greatness by height or size: One feels a certain uneasiness in feeling a great depth; and, hence depth is made to express anything disagreeable by excess, as depth of grief, depth of despair; Again, Height of place, and time long past, produce similar feelings; and hence the expression, Ut alius repetam! Distance in past time, producing a strong feeling, is put for any strong feeling; Nihil mihi antiquus nofra amicitia: Shortness with relation to space, for shortness with relation to time; Brevis effe laboro, obfcurus fio: Suffering a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> resembles paying a debt; hence pendere penas. In the same manner, light may be put for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, sunshine for prosperity, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> for importance.\n\nMany words, originally figurative, having, by long and constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, lost their figurative power, are degraded to the inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of proper terms. Thus the words that express the operation of the mind, have in all languages been originally figurative: the reason holds in all, that when these operations came first under consideration, there was no other way of describing them but by what they resembled: it was not practicable to give them proper names, as may be done to objects that can be ascertained by sight and touch. A soft nature, jarring tempers, weight of woe, pompous phrase, beget compassion, affluage grief, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOW\">vow</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> the eye downward, bow down curles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DROWNING\">drowning</a> in tears, wrapt in joy, warm'd with eloquence, loaded with spoils, and a thousand other expressions of the like nature, have lost their figurative sense. Some terms there are that cannot be said to be altogether figurative or altogether proper: originally figurative, they are tending to simplicity, without having lost altogether their figurative power. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-REGINA\">Regina</a> faucis cura, is perhaps one of these expressions: with ordinary readers, faucis will be considered as expressing simply the effect of grief; but one of a lively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> will exalt the phrase into a figure.\n\nFor epitomizing this subject, and at the same time for giving a clear view of it, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Kames gives a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of the several relations upon which figures of speech are commonly founded. This list he divides into two tables; one of subjects expressed figuratively, and one of attributes.\n\n**Tab. I. Subjects expressed figuratively.**\n\n1. A word proper to one subject employed figuratively to express a resembling subject.\n\nThere is no figure of speech so frequent, as what is derived from the relation of resembling. Youth, for example, is signified figuratively by the morning of life. The life of a man resembles a natural day in several particulars: the morning is the beginning of a day, youth the beginning of life; the morning is cheerful, so is youth, &c. By another resemblance, a bold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a> is termed the thunderbolt of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>; a multitude of troubles, a sea of troubles.\n\nThis figure, above all others, affords pleasure to the mind by variety of beauties. Besides the beauties above mentioned, common to all sorts, it possesses in particular the beauty of a metaphor or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIMILE\">simile</a>: a figure of speech built upon resemblance, suggests always a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> between the principal subject and the accessory; whereby every good effect of a metaphor or simile may, in a short and lively manner, be produced by this figure of speech.\n\n2. A word proper to the effect employed figuratively to express the cause.\n\nLux for the sun; Shadow for cloud. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELMET\">helmet</a> is signified by the expression glittering terror; a tree by shadow or umbrage. Hence the expression,\n\nNec habet Pelion umbras. OVID.\n\nWhere the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUN\">dun</a> umbrage hangs. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">Spring</a>, l. 1023.\n\nA wound is made to signify an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARROW\">arrow</a>:\n\nVulnere non pedibus te consecuar. OVID.\n\nThere is a peculiar force and beauty in this figure: the word which signifies figuratively the principal subject, denotes it to be a cause by suggesting the effect.\n\n3. A word proper to the cause employed figuratively to express the effect.\n\nBoumque labores for corn. Sorrow or grief for tears.\n\nAgain Ulysses weild his penive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>;\n\nAgain unmann'd, a flow'r of sorrow thied.\n\nStreaming grief his faded cheek bedew'd,\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLINDNESS\">Blindness</a> for darkness:\n\nC\u00e6cis erramus in undis. \u00c6neid. iii. 200.\n\nThere is a peculiar energy in this figure, similar to that in the former: the figurative name denotes the subject to be an effect by suggesting its cause.\n\n4. Two things being intimately connected, the proper name of the one employed figuratively to signify the other.\n\nDay for light. Night for darkness; and hence, A sudden night.\n\nWinter for a storm at sea:\n\nInterea magno militer murmure pontum,\n\nEmiliamque Hyemem senuit Neptunus. \u00c6neid. i. 128.\n\nThis last figure would be too bold for a British writer, as a storm at sea is not inseparably connected with winter in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>.\n\n5. A word proper to an attribute, employed figuratively to denote the subject.\n\nYouth and beauty for those who are young and beautiful:\n\nYouth and beauty shall be laid in dust.\n\nMajesty for the king:\n\nWhat art thou, that usurp'st this time of night,\n\nTogether with that fair and warlike form\n\nIn which the Majesty of buried <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>\n\nDid sometime <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a>? <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMLET\">Hamlet</a>, act. i. sc. i.\nOr have ye chosen this place,\nAfter the toils of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> to repose\nYour weary'd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>?\nParadise Lost.\n\nVerdure for a green field.\nSummer, l. 301.\n\nSpeaking of cranes,\nThe pigny nations, wounds and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> they bring,\nAnd all the war descends upon the wing.\nIliad, book iii. l. 10.\n\nCool age advances venerably wise.\nIliad, book iii. l. 149.\n\nThe peculiar beauty of this figure arises from suggesting an attribute that embellishes the subject, or puts it in a stronger light.\n\n6. A complex term employed figuratively to denote one of the component parts.\nFunus for a dead body. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURIAL\">Burial</a> for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>.\n\n7. The name of one of the component parts instead of the complex term.\nTedeo for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>. The East for a country situated east from us. Jovis vigilia servat, for imitating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> in general.\n\n8. A word signifying time or place, employed figuratively to denote what is connected with it.\nClima for a nation, or for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>; hence the expression, Merciful clime, Fleecy winter, for snow, Seculum felix.\n\n9. A part for the whole.\nThe pole for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. The head for the person:\nTriginta minas pro <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPITE\">capite</a> tuo dedi. Plautus.\n\nTergum for the man:\nFugiens tergum. Ovid.\n\nVultus for the man:\nJam fulgor armorum fugaces\nTerret equos, equitumque vultus.\nHorat.\n\nQuis defiderio fit pudor aut modus\nTam chari capitio?\nHorat.\n\nDumque virent genua?\nHorat.\n\nThy growing virtues justify'd my cares,\nAnd promis'd comfort to my filser hairs.\nIliad, book ix. l. 616.\n\nForthwith from the pool he rears\nHis mighty stature.\nParadise Lost.\n\nThe silent heart which grief affails.\nParnell.\n\nThe peculiar beauty of this figure consists in marking that part which makes the greatest figure.\n\n10. The name of the container, employed figuratively to signify what is contained.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROVE\">Grove</a> for the birds in it; Vocal grove. Ships for the seamen; Agonizing ships. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">Mountains</a> for the sheep pasturing upon them; Bleating mountains. Zacynthus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITHACA\">Ithaca</a>, &c. for the inhabitants; Ex mefii domibus. Livy.\n\n11. The name of the sustainer, employed figuratively to signify what is sustained.\nAltar for the sacrifice. Field for the battle fought upon it; Well-fought field.\n\n12. The name of the materials, employed figuratively to signify the things made of them.\nFerrum for gladius.\n\n13. The names of the Heathen deities, employed figuratively to signify what they patronize.\nJove for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a> for war, Venus for beauty, Cupid for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>, Ceres for corn, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEPTUNE\">Neptune</a> for the sea, Vulcan for fire.\n\nThis figure befores great elevation upon the subject; and therefore ought to be confined to the higher strains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>.\n\nTab. II. Attributes expressed figuratively.\n\n1. When two attributes are connected, the name of the one may be employed figuratively to express the other.\nPurity and virginity are attributes of the same person; hence the expression, Virgin know, for pure know.\n\n2. A word signifying properly an attribute of one subject, employed figuratively to express a resembling attribute of another subject.\nTottering state. Imperious ocean. Angry flood. Raging tempest. Shallow fears.\n\nMy sure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> shall bear the shield,\nAnd edge thy sword to reap the glorious field.\nOdyssey, book xx. l. 61.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OMEN\">omen</a>, for an omen that portends bad fortune.\nAter omen.\nVirgil.\n\nThe peculiar beauty of this figure arises from suggesting a comparison.\n\n3. A word proper to the subject, employed to express one of its attributes.\nMens for intellectus. Mens for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>:\nIstam, oro, exue mentem.\n\n4. When two subjects have a resemblance by a common quality, the name of the one subject may be employed figuratively to denote that quality in the other:\nSummer life for agreeable life.\n\n5. The name of the instrument made to signify the power of employing it:\nMelpomene, cui liquidam pater\nVocem cum euthara dedit.\n\nThe ample field of figurative expression displayed in these tables, affords great scope for reasoning. Several of the observations relating to metaphor, are applicable to figures of speech: these shall be slightly retouched, together, with some additions peculiarly adapted to the present subject.\n\n1. As the figure under consideration is built upon relation, we find from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, and it must be obvious from reason, that the beauty of it depends on the intimacy of the relation between the figurative and proper sense of the word. A slight resemblance, in particular, will never make this figure agreeable: the expression, for example, Drink down a secret, for listening to a secret with attention, is harsh and uncouth, because there is scarce any resemblance between listening and drinking. The expression weighty crack, used by Ben Jonson for loud crack, is worse if possible; a loud sound has not the slightest resemblance to a piece of matter that is weighty.\n\nPhemius! let acts of gods, and heroes old,\nWhat ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARDS\">bards</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> and bow'r have told;\nAttemper'd\nAttemper'd to the lyre, your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> employ,\nSuch the pleas'd ear will drink with silent joy.\n*Odyssey*, book i. l. 433.\n\nStrepitumque exterritus haust.\n*\u00c6neid*, book vi. l. 559.\n\nWrite, my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>,\nAnd with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send.\n*Cymbeline*, act i. sc. 2.\n\nAs thus th' effulgence tremulous I drink.\n*Summer*, l. 1684.\n\nNeque audit currus habenas.\n*Georg.*, book i. l. 514.\n\nO prince! (Lycaon's valiant son reply'd),\nAs thine the steeds, be thine the talk to guide.\nThe horses practis'd to their lord's command,\nShall hear the rein, and answer to thy hand.\n*Iliad*, book v. l. 288.\n\nThe following figures of speech seem altogether wild and extravagant, the figurative and proper meaning having no connexion whatever. *Moving softness*, *Freshness breather*, *Breathing prospect*, *Flowing spring*, *Dewy light*, *Lucid coolness*, and many others of this false <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>, may be found in Thomson's *Seasons*.\n\n2. The proper sense of the word ought to bear some proportion to the figurative sense, and not soar much above it, nor sink much below it. This rule, as well as the foregoing, is finely illustrated by Vida, *Poet.*, book iii. l. 148.\n\n3. In a figure of speech, every circumstance ought to be avoided that agrees with the proper sense only, not with the figurative sense: for it is the latter that expresses the thought, and the former serves for no other purpose but to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>:\n\nZacynthus green with ever-shady groves,\nAnd Ithaca, presumptuous boast their loves;\nObtruding on my choice a second lord,\nThey press the Hymenean rite abhorred.\n*Odyssey*, book xix. l. 152.\n\nZacynthus here standing figuratively for the inhabitants, the description of the island is quite out of place: it puzzles the reader, by making him doubt whether the word ought to be taken in its proper or figurative sense.\n\nWrite, my queen,\nAnd with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,\nThough <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INK\">ink</a> be made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALL\">gall</a>.\n*Cymbeline*, act i. sc. 2.\n\nThe difficult one has to drink ink in reality, is not to the purpose where the subject is drinking ink figuratively.\n\n4. To draw consequences from a figure of speech, as if the word were to be understood literally, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> absurdity; for it is confounding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> with fiction:\n\nBe Moubray's sins so heavy in his bosom,\nThat they may break his foaming courser's back,\nAnd throw the rider headlong in the lists,\nA caitiff recreant to my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEREFORD\">Hereford</a>.\n*Ricard II.*, act i. sc. 3.\n\nSin may be imagined heavy in a figurative sense: but weight in a proper sense belongs to the accessory only; and therefore to describe the effects of weight, is to defer the principal subject, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the accessory into a principal:\n\nCromwell. How does your Grace?\nWolsey. Why, well;\nNever so truly happy, my good Cromwell.\nI know myself now, and I feel within me\nA peace above all earthly dignities,\nA still and quiet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>. The king has cur'd me,\nI humbly thank his Grace: and, from these shoulders,\nThese ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken\nA load would sink a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>, too much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>.\n*Henry VIII.*, act iii. sc. 6.\n\nUlysses speaking of Hector\u2014\n\nI wonder now how yonder <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> stands,\nWhen we have here the base and pillar by us.\n*Troilus and Cressida*, Act. iv. Sc. 9.\n\nOthello.

But then in the expression, lives is again put for blood; and by thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAFTING\">grafting</a> one figure upon another, the expression is rendered obscure and unpleasant.\n\nNinthly, Intricate and involved figures, that can scarce be analyzed, or reduced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> language, are least of all tolerable:\n\nVotis incendimus aras.\n*\u00c6neid*, book iii. l. 279.\n\nOnerentique canistris\nDona laborate Cereris\n*\u00c6neid*, book viii. l. 180.\n\nVulcan to the Cyclops:\n\nArma acri facienda viro: nunc viribus usus,\nNunc manibus rapidis, omni nunc arte magistra:\nPrecipitate moras.\n*\u00c6neid*, book viii. l. 441.\n\nHuic gladio, perque <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> scuta,\nPer tunicum squalentem auro, latus haurit apertum.\n*\u00c6neid*, book x. l. 313.\n\nScriberis Vario fortis, et hosfium\nVictor, M\u00e6onii carminis alie.\n*Horat.* Carm. lib. i. ode 6.\n\nElfe shall our fates be number'd with the dead.\n\n*Iliad*, book v. l. 294.\n\nCommunal death the fate of war confounds.\n\n*Iliad*, book viii. l. 85, and book xi. l. 117.\n\nSpeaking of Proteus:\n\nInstant he wears, elusive of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAPE\">rape</a>,\nThe mimic force of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> shape.\n\n*Odyssey*, book iv. l. 563.\n\nRolling convulsive on the floor, is seen\nThe piteous object of a prostrate queen.\n\n*Ibid.* book iv. l. 652.\n\nThe mingling tempest weaves its gloom.\n\n*Autumn*, l. 337.\n\nA various sweetness swells the gentle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>.\n\n*Ibid.*, l. 640.\n\nThe distant waterfall swells in the breeze.\n\n*Winter*, l. 738.\n\nIn the tenth place, When a subject is introduced by its proper name, it is absurd to attribute to it the properties of a different subject to which the word is sometimes applied in a figurative sense:\n\nHear me, Oh Neptune! thou whose arms are hurl'd\nFrom shore to shore, and gird the fold world.\n\n*Odyssey*, book ix. l. 617.\n\nNeptune is here introduced personally, and not figuratively, for the ocean; the description therefore, which is only applicable to the latter, is altogether improper.\n\nIt is not sufficient that a figure of speech be regularly constructed, and be free from blemish; it requires taste to discern when it is proper, when improper; and taste perhaps is our only guide. One, however, may gather from reflections and experience, that ornaments and graces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> not any of the disfiguring passions, nor are proper for expressing anything grave and important. In familiar conversation, they are in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> ridiculous: Prospero, in the *Tempest*, speaking to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> Miranda, says,\n\nThe fringed curtains of thine eyes advance,\nAnd say what thou feel'st fond.\n\nNo exception can be taken to the justness of the figure; and circumstances may be imagined to make it proper: but it is certainly not proper in familiar conversation.\n\nIn the last place, Though figures of speech have a charming effect when accurately constructed and properly introduced, they ought, however, to be scattered with a sparing hand; nothing is more ludicrous, and nothing consequently more fatiguing, than redundant ornaments of any kind.\n\nFigure is used, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">Theology</a>, for the mysteries represented or delivered obscurely to us under certain types, or actions in the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>. Thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANNA\">manna</a> is held a figure or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYPE\">type</a> of the eucharist; and the death of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABEL\">Abel</a> a figure of the suffering of Christ.\n\nMany divines and critics contend, that all the actions, histories, ceremonies, &c. of the Old Testament, are only figures, types, and prophecies, of what was to happen under the New. The Jews are supposed\nFigure to have had the figures or shadows, and we the substance.\n\nFigure is also applied in a like sense to profane matters; as the emblems, enigmas, fables, symbols, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIEROGLYPHICS\">hieroglyphics</a>, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>.","sp":231,"ep":239},{"h":"FIGURED","t":"in general, something marked with figures.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> figured is chiefly applied to stuffs, whereon the figures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, and the like, are either wrought <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> stamped.\n\nFigured, in Music, is applied either to simple notes or to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>: to simple notes, as in these words figured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASS\">bass</a>, to express a bass whose notes carrying chords are subdivided into many other notes of lesser value; to harmony, when, by supposition and in a diatonic procedure, other notes than those which form the chord are employed.

See also the article Bark.\n\nThe same author informs us, that the stalks of nettles are used for the like purposes in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, France. And Sir Hans Sloane relates, in one of his letters to Mr Ray, that he has been informed by several, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MUSLIN\">muslin</a> and calico, and most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> linens, are made of nettles.\n\nIn some of the Swedish provinces, a strong kind of cloth is said to be prepared from hop stalks: and in the transactions of the Swedish Academy for the year 1750, there is an account of an experiment made in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of that report. Of the stalks, gathered in autumn, about as many were taken as equalled in bulk a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of flax that would have produced a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>. The stalks were put into water, and kept covered therewith during the winter. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> they were taken out, dried in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOVE\">stove</a>, and dressed as flax. The prepared filaments weighed nearly a pound, and proved fine, soft, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>: They were spun and woven into six ells of fine strong cloth. The author, Mr Shiller, observes, that hop stalks take much longer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to rot than flax; and that, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not fully rotted, the woody <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not separate, and the cloth will neither prove white nor fine.\n\nHemp, flax, and all other vegetable filaments, and thread or cloth prepared from them, differ remarkably from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, silk, and other animal productions, not only in the principles into which they are reducible by fire, but likewise in some of their more interesting properties, particularly in their disposition to imbibe colouring matters; sundry liquors, which give a beautiful and durable dye to those of the animal, giving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> stain at all to those of the vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>.\n\nA solution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> in aquafortis, which had been changed blue by an addition of volatile spirit, on being mixed with a little solution of tin, became turbid and greenish. Pieces of white silk and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a> boiled, without any previous preparation, in this mixture, received a bright deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> dye; whilst pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, prepared and unprepared, came out as colourless as they were put in.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">Fishing</a> nets are usually boiled with oak bark or other like astringents, which render them more lasting. Those made of flax receive from this decoction a brownish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, which, by the repeated alternations of water and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, is in a little time discharged, whilst the fine glossy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>, communicated by the same means to silken nets, permanently resists both the air and water, and stands as long as the animal filaments themselves. In like manner the stain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INK\">ink</a>, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> dye from solutions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, mixed with vegetable astringents, proves durable in silk and woollen; but from linen, the astringent matter is extracted by washing, and only the yellow iron would remain.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> decoction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COCHINEAL\">cochineal</a>, which, heightened with a little solution of tin, gives the fiery scarlet dye to wool or silk that have been previously impregnated with solution of tartar, makes no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> upon linen or cotton prepared in the same manner. M. du Fay informs us, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the French Academy for the year 1737, that having prepared a mixed cloth whose warp was of wool and the woof of cotton, and thoroughly blended the two together by fulling, he still found the cotton to resist the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the scarlet liquor, and the wool to receive the same colour from it as wool by itself, the stuff coming out all over mottled fiery and white.\n\nMany other instances of this kind are known too well to the calico printer; whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> desideratum it is, to find means of making linen receive the same colours that wool does. The physical cause of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> is wholly unknown; and indeed, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of dyes in general, we know as yet extremely little. (See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYEING\">Dyeing</a>.) Are animal filaments tubular, and the colouring atoms received within them? Are vegetable filaments <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>, and the colour deposited on the surface? Or, does not their different susceptibility of colour depend rather on the different intrinsic properties of the two? There are many instances of a like diversity, even in...\nFilaments in the metallic kingdom, where a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> difference in texture can scarcely be presumed to be the cause: Thus silver receives a deep stain from sulphurous or putrid vapours, or the yolk of a boiled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>, which have no effect upon tin.\n\nFilaments, among botanists.

Profane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> furnishes many fine examples of this amiable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>; a few of which we shall select, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> observed in other similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>.\n\n1. The Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DICTATOR\">dictator</a> T. Manlius having exercised great cruelty over the citizens, was cited at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> of his office to answer for his conduct. Among other things that were laid to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>, he was accused of treating with barbarity one of his own sons. Manlius, according to Livy, had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other cause of complaint against this son than his having an impediment in his speech. For this reason he was banished far from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, from his home, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of those of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> and fortune, and condemned to servile works. All were highly exasperated against such inhuman conduct, except the son himself, who, under the greatest concern that he should furnish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a> against his father, resorted upon a most extraordinary method to relieve him. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, without apprising any body, he came to the city armed with a dagger, and went directly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUNE\">tribune</a> Pomponius, who had accused his father. Pomponius was yet in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>. Young Manlius sent up his name, and was immediately admitted by the tribune, who did not doubt but he was come to discover to him some new instances of his father\u2019s severity. But Manlius, as soon as he was left alone with the tribune, drew out his dagger, and presented it to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>; declaring he would stab him that moment if he did not swear in the form he should dictate, \u201cNever to hold the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> of the people for accusing his father.\u201d Pomponius, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the dagger glittering at his breast, himself alone without arms, Liv. 1.7. and attacked by a robust young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, full of a bold confidence in his own strength, took the oath demanded of him; and afterwards contended with a kind of complacency in the thing, and a sincerity which sufficiently...\ncidently argued he was not sorry for what he had done, that it was that violence which obliged him to desist from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>.\n\n2. Among the multitude of persons who were proscribed under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> triumvirate of Rome, were the celebrated orator Cicero and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Quintus. The fate of the former, in endeavouring to make his escape, is related under the article Cicero. The latter found means to conceal himself so effectually at home, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> could not find him. Enraged at their disappointment, they put his son to the torture, in order to make him discover the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of his father's concealment; but filial affection was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> against the most exquisite torments. An involuntary sigh, and sometimes a deep groan, was all that could be extorted from the youth. His agonies were increased; but with amazing fortitude he still persisted in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of not betraying his father. Quintus was not far off; and it may be imagined better than can be expressed, how his heart must have been affected with the sighs and groans of a son expiring in tortures to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. He could bear it no longer; but quitting the place of his concealment, he presented himself to the assassins, begging of them to put him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, and dismiss the innocent youth, whose generous behaviour the triumvirs themselves, if informed of the fact, would judge worthy of the highest approbation. But the inhuman monsters, without being the least affected with the tears either of the father or the son, answered, that they both must die; the father because he was proscribed, and the son because he had concealed his father.\n\nThen a new contest of tenderminds arose who should die first; but this the assassins soon decided, by beheading them both at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>.\u2014This anecdote is related by Appian, Dio, Plutarch, Valerius Maximus, and other historians.\n\n3. Cinna, who scrupled no attempt, how atrocious soever, which could serve his purpose, undertook to get Pomponius Strabo murdered in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENT\">tent</a>; but his son saved his life, which was the first remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of Pompey the Great. The treacherous Cinna, by many alluring promises, had gained over one Terentius, a confidant of Pompey's, and prevailed on him to affiancet the general, and seduce his troops. Young Pompey being informed of this design a few hours before it was to be put in execution, placed a faithful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> round the praetorium; so that none of the conspirators could come near it. He then watched all the motions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>, and endeavoured to appease the fury of the soldiers, who hated the general his father, by such acts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> as were worthy of the oldest commanders. However, some of the mutineers having forced open one of the gates of the camp, in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> to Cinna, the general's son threw himself flat on his back in their way, crying out, that they should not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> their oath and desert their commander, without treading his body to death. By this means he put a stop to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFECTION\">defection</a>, and afterwards wrought so effectually upon them by his affecting speeches and engaging carriage, that he reconciled them to his father.\n\n4. Olympias, Alexander's own mother, was of such an unhappy disposition, that he would never allow her to have any concern in the affairs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. She used frequently to make very severe complaints on that account; but he always submitted to her ill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> with great mildness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>. Antipater, one of his friends, having one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> written a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> against her to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> then absent, the latter, after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> it, replied, \"Antipater does not know that one single tear shed by a mother <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> obliterate ten thousand such letters as this.\" A behaviour like this, and such an answer, show at one and the same time, that Alexander was both an affectionate son and an able politician.\n\n5. Epaminondas is universally acknowledged to have been one of the greatest generals and one of the best men which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> ever produced. Before him the city of Thebes was not distinguished by any memorable action, and after him it was not famous for its virtues, but its misfortunes, till it sunk into its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> obscurity; so that it saw its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> take birth and expire with this great man. The victory he obtained at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEUCTRA\">Leuctra</a> had drawn the eyes and admiration of all the neighbouring people upon Epaminondas, who looked upon him as the support of Thebes, as the triumphant conqueror of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPARTA\">Sparta</a>, as the deliverer of Greece: in a word, as the greatest man, and the most excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>, that ever was in the world. In the midst of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> applause, so capable of making the general of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> forget the man for the victor, Epaminondas, little sensible to so affecting and so deserved a glory, \"My joy (said he) arises from my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of that which the news of my victory will give my father and my mother.\"\n\n6. Among an incredible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of illustrious persons who were falsely accused and put to death by Nero, was one Barcas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-SORANUS\">Soranus</a>; a man, as Tacitus informs us, of singular vigilance and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> in the discharge of his duty. During his confinement, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> Servilia was apprehended and brought into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>, and there arraigned. The crime laid to her charge was, that she had turned into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> all her ornaments and jewels, and the most valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of her dress, to defray the expense of consulting magicians. To this the young Servilia, with tears, replied, That she had indeed consulted magicians, but the whole of her inquiry was to know whether the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> and senate would afford protection and safety to her dear and indulgent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> against his accusers. \"With this view (said she) I presented the diviners, men till now utterly unknown to me, with my jewels, apparel, and the other ornaments peculiar to my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, as I would have presented my blood and life, could my blood and life have procured my father's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>. But whatever this my proceeding was, my unfortunate father was an utter stranger to it; and if it is a crime, I alone am the delinquent.\" She was, however, together with her father, condemned to die; but in what manner, history is silent. [Vid. Taciti Annales, lib. vi. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 20.]\n\n7. Valerius Maximus likewise relates a very singular fact upon this subject. A woman of illustrious birth had been condemned to be strangled. The Roman pretor delivered her up to the triumvir, who caused her to be carried to prison, in order to her being put to death. The gaoler, who was ordered to execute her, was struck with compassion, and could not resolve to kill her. He chose therefore to let her die of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>. Besides which, he suffered her daughter\nFilibeg, to see her in prison; taking care, however, that she brought her nothing to eat. As this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> many days, he was surprised that the prisoner lived so long without eating; and supposing the daughter, upon watching her, he discovered that she nourished her mother with her own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>. Amazed at so pious, and at the same time so ingenious an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, he told the fact to the triumvir, and the triumvir to the praetor, who believed the thing merited relating in the assembly of the people. The criminal was pardoned, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> was passed that the mother and daughter should be subsisted for the rest of their lives at the expense of the public.\n\nThe same author gives a similar instance of filial piety in a young woman named Xantippe to her aged father Cimonus, who was likewise confined in prison, and which is universally known by the name of the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">Charity</a>. Both these instances appeared so very extraordinary and uncommon to that people, that they could only account for them, by supposing that the love of children to their parents was the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of nature. *Putaret aliquis* (says our author) *hoc contra naturam factum esse, nisi prima naturae lex esset diligere parentes.*\n\nIn addition to the foregoing examples, we may refer to the article *\u00c6tna*, where a very noble instance of filial piety is taken notice of.

And what renders it a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of greater curiosity is the coarseness of the tools employed in the workmanship, and which, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of an European, would not be thought sufficiently perfect for the most ordinary purposes.\u2014They are rudely and inartificially formed, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDSMITH\">goldsmith</a> (pandi) from any old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> he can pick up. When you engage one of them to execute a piece of work, his first request is usually for a piece of iron, hoop, to make his wire-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>; an old hammer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, stuck in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a>, serves for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANVIL\">anvil</a>; and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPASSES\">compasses</a> is often composed of two old nails tied together at one end. The gold is melted in a piece of a *preewo* or earthen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>-pot, or sometimes in a crucible of their own make, of ordinary clay. In general they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> no bellows, but blow the fire with their mouths, through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> of bamboo; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of metal to be melted is considerable, three or four persons fit round their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a>, which is an old broken quailie or iron pot, and blow together. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PADANG\">Padang</a> alone, where the manufacture is more considerable, they have adopted the Chinese bellows. Their method of drawing the wire differs but little from that used by European workmen. When drawn to a sufficient fineness, they flatten it by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> it on their anvil; and when flattened, they give it a twist like that in the whalebone handle of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNCH\">punch</a> ladle, by rubbing it on a block of wood with a flat stick. After twisting they again <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> it on the anvil, and by these means it becomes flat wire with indented edges. With a pair of nippers they fold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the end of the wire, and thus form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>, or element of a flower in their work, which is cut off. The end is again folded and cut off, till they have got a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of leaves, which are all laid on singly. Patterns of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> or foliage, in which there is not very much variety, are prepared on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, of the size of the gold plate on which the fillagree is to be laid. According to this, they begin to dispose on the plate the larger compartments of the foliage, for which they use <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> flat wire of a larger size, and fill them up with the leaves before mentioned. To fix the work, they employ a gelatinous substance, made of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>-hot berry called *boea sagu*, ground to a pulp on a rough <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>. This pulp they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> on a young\nyoung cocoa <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> about the size of a walnut, the top and bottom being cut off. After the leaves have been all placed in order, and stuck on, bit by bit, a folder is prepared of gold filings and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BORAX\">borax</a>, moistened with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, which they strew over the plate; and then putting it in the fire for a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, the whole becomes united. This kind of work on a gold plate, they call carrang papan: when the work is open, they call it carrang troufe.\n\nIn executing the latter, the foliage is laid out on a card, or soft kind of wood, and stuck on, as before described, with the sago berry; and the work, when finished, being strewed over with their folder, is put into the fire, when the card or soft wood <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> away, the gold remains connected. If the piece be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, they folder it at several times. In the manufacture of badjoo buttons, they first make the lower part flat, and having a mould formed of a piece of buffalo's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>, indented to several sizes, each like one half of a bullet mould, they lay their work over one of these holes, and with a horn punch they press it into the form of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTON\">button</a>. After this they complete the upper part.\n\nWhen the fillagree is finished, they cleanse it, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> it in water with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>, or sometimes lime juice; and in order to give it that fine purple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> which they call safo, they boil it in water with brimstone. The manner of making the little balls with which their works are sometimes ornamented, is as follows: They take a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a>, and having cut it flat and smooth, they make in it a small hole, which they fill with gold dust, and this melted in the fire becomes a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>. They are very inexpert at finishing and polishing the plain parts, hinges, screws, and the like, being in this as much excelled by the European artists, as they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> short of them in the fineness and minuteness of the foliage. The Chinese also make fillagree mostly of silver, which looks elegant, but wants likewise the extraordinary delicacy of the Malay work.\n\nThe price of the workmanship depends upon the difficulty or uncommonness of the pattern. In some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of usual demand, it does not exceed one-third of the value of the gold; but in matters of fancy, it is generally equal to it.","sp":242,"ep":243},{"h":"FILLET","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Filet, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">Architecture</a>, denotes a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> member or ornament used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> places, and on divers occasions, but generally as a sort of cornice over a greater moulding.\n\nThe fillet is the same with what the French call reglet, bande, and bandelette; the Italians lista or listella.\n\nFillet, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HERALDRY\">Heraldry</a>, a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORLE\">orle</a> or bordure, containing only a third or fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the breadth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> bordure.

This depended on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the feudal connexion; it not being reasonable, nor allowed, that a feudatory should transfer his lord's gift to another, and substitute a new tenant to do the service in his own stead, without the consent of the lord: and, as the feudal obligation was considered as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a>, the lord also could not alienate his feignory without the consent of his tenant, which consent of his was called an attornment. The restraint upon the lord soon wore away; that upon the tenant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> longer. For, when every thing came in proceeds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to be bought and sold, the lords would not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> a licence to their tenants to alien, without a fine being paid; apprehending that, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it was reasonable for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> to pay a fine or relief on the renovation of his paternal estate, it was much more reasonable that a stranger should make the same acknowledgment on his acquisition of a newly purchased <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEUD\">feud</a>. In England, these fines seem only to have been exacted from the king's tenants in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPITE\">capite</a>, who were never able to alien without a licence; but as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> persons, they were at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNA_CHARTA\">magna <a cla</a>ss=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARTA\">charta</a>, and the statute of quia emptores (if not earlier), to alien the whole of their estate, to be holden of the same lord as they themselves held it of before. But the king's tenants in capite, not being included under the general words of these statutes, could not alien without a licence; for if they did, it was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> strictness an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> forfeiture of the land; though some have imagined otherwise. But this severity was mitigated by the statute 1 Edw. III. c. 12. which ordained, that in such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the lands should not be forfeited, but a reasonable fine be paid to the king. Upon which statute it was settled, that one-third of the yearly value should be paid.\npaid for a license of alienation; but, if the tenant prelumed to alienate without a license, a full year's value should be paid.

He flourished in the third century; and according to the Irish histories died in the year 283, although there is some reason from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OSSIAN\">Ossian</a>'s poems for placing his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> a few years later. Fingal was descended in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> from those Celtic tribes who were the first inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">Tradition</a>, and the poems of Ossian, give him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> line of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, such as Combal, Tremor, Trathal, &c., who had all reigned over the same territory. Whether this territory was bounded by the Caledonian forest, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> extended somewhat farther to the south, towards the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>, is uncertain; but there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> doubt of its having extended over all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> and west Highlands, comprehending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBRIDES\">Hebrides</a>, whose petty chiefs were all subject to the king of Morven. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of residence was Selma, which was probably in the neighbourhood of Glenco, supposed to be the Cona of Ossian; though some imagine it to have been in Strath-Conan in Moray. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> seems to be, that as Fingal and his people lived by hunting, they often shifted their habitations. Hence, in all parts of the Highlands we find, in the names of places, buildings, &c., such monuments as justify their several claims for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of Fingal's residence. Fingal acquired great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> by his prowess in arms. He made many successful incursions into the Roman province, from whence he carried away those spoils which his son so often mentions under the names of the wine of the stranger, and the wax of the stranger. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> we find him frequently making voyages to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCANDINAVIA\">Scandinavia</a>, the Orkneys, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>; called by Ossian Lochlin, Innisfiorr and Ullin. Several of these expeditions were celebrated by his son in epic poems, of which two only remain, Fingal and Temora. In the last of these poems, we find Fingal fighting together with his grandson Ossian. How long he lived afterwards is uncertain. He is said to have died a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> death; and therefore none of his son's poems relate to this event, though it is occasionally mentioned in many of them.\n\n\"Did thy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> last, O Ryno? Stood the strength of car-borne Ossian? Fingal himself panted away; and the halls of his fathers have forgotten his steps. The blast of the north opens thy gates, O king, and I behold thee sitting on midst, dimly gleaming in all thine arms. Thy form now is not the terror of the valiant: but like a watery cloud, when we see the stars behind it, with their weeping eyes. Thy shield is like the aged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>; thy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> vapour half kindled with fire.

The sons of little men are afraid, and a thousand showers descend.\u2014Berrathon.\n\n\"The character of Fingal (Dr Blair observes) is perhaps the most perfect that ever was drawn by a poet, for we may boldly defy all the writers of antiquity to show us any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> equal to Fingal. Throughout the whole of Ossian's works, he is presented to us in all that variety of lights which give the full display of a character. In him concur almost all the qualities that can ennoble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; that can either make us admire the hero, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>. He is not only unconquerable in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, but he makes his people happy by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> in the days of peace. He is truly the father of his people. He is known by the epithet of 'Fingal'...\"\nFingal. 'Fingal of the mildest look,' and distinguished on every occasion by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> and generosity. He is merciful to his foes, full of affection to his children, full of concern about his friends, and never mentions Agandecca, his first love, without the utmost tenderness. He is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> protector of the distressed; none ever went far from Fingal.\u2014'O Oicar! <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> the strong in arms, but spare the feeble hand. Be thou a stream of many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> against the foes of thy people; but like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALE\">gale</a> that moves the grass to those who ask thine aid: so Tremor lived; such Trathal was; and such has Fingal been. My arm was the support of the injured; the weak relied behind the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a> of my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>.' These were the maxims of true heroism, to which he formed his grandson. His fame is represented as everywhere spread; the greatest heroes acknowledge his superiority; his enemies tremble at his name; and the highest encomiums that can be bestowed on one whom the poet would most exalt, is to say, That his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> was like the soul of Fingal. Wherever he appears, we behold the hero. The objects he pursues are always great; to bend the proud, to protect the injured, to defend his friends, to overcome his enemies by generosity more than by force. Some strokes of human imperfection and frailty are what usually give us the most clear view and the most sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of a character, because they present to us a man such as we have seen; they reveal known features of human nature. When poets go beyond this range, and attempt to describe a faultless hero, they, for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>, let before us a sort of vague undistinguishable character, such as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> cannot lay hold of, or realize to itself as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of affection. But Fingal, though exhibited without any of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> human failings, is nevertheless a real man; a character which touches and interests every reader.\"\n\nWe may observe, that Fingal appears to have been no less a poet than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a>; at least, in all those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> ascribed to him in the poems of his son, there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> and loftiness that elevates them above the common style even of Ossian. The following passage from the poem of Garthon may be taken as a specimen of Fingal's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>. \"\u2014Raife, ye <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARDS\">bards</a>,\" said the mighty Fingal, \"the praise of the unhappy Moina. Call her ghost, with your songs, to our hills; that she may rest with the fair of Morven, the sunbeams of other days, and the delight of heroes of old.\u2014I have seen the walls of Balclutha, but they were desolate.

The celebrated philosophers of the last century, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a>, Boyle, and Newton, were of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that fire was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> distinct substance from other bodies, but that it consisted entirely in the violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the parts of any body. As no motion, however, can be produced without a cause, they were obliged to have recourse to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> force or impulse as the ultimate cause of fire in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>. Thus Boyle tells us, that when a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> becomes hot by hammering, \"there is nothing to make it so, except the forcible motion of the hammer imprinting a vehement and variously determined agitation on the small parts of the iron.\" Bacon defines <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, which he makes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a> with fire, to be \"an expansive undulatory motion in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> particles of a body, whereby they tend with some rapidity from a centre towards a circumference, and at the same time a little upwards.\" Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton did nothing positive upon the subject; but conjectured that grots bodies and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> might be convertible into one another; and that great bodies of the size of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> when violently heated, might continue and increase their heat by the mutual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REACTION\">reaction</a> of their parts.\n\nBut while the mechanical philosophers thus endeavoured to account for the phenomena of fire upon the same principles which they judged sufficient to explain those of the universe in general, the chemists as strenuously asserted that fire was a fluid of a certain kind, distinct from all others, and universally present throughout the whole globe. Boerhaave particularly maintained this doctrine; and in support of it brought the following argument, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> and flint would strike fire, and produce the very same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of heat, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol16.html#article-NOVA_ZEMBLA\">Nova Zembla</a>, which they would do under the equator. Other arguments were drawn from the increased <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of metallic calces, which they supposed to proceed from the fixing of the element of fire in the substance whose weight was thus increased. By these experiments Mr. Boyle himself seems to have been staggered; as he published a treatise on the possibility of making fire and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> ponderable; though this was directly contrary to his own principles already quoted. For a long time, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> was most violently disputed; and the mechanical philosophers, though their arguments were equally inconclusive with those of their adversaries, at last prevailed through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> in favour of Sir Isaac Newton, who indeed had scarce taken any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> in the contest.\n\nThat the cause of fire cannot be any mechanical motion which we can impel, is very evident; because on mechanical principles an effect must always be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the cause. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of fire, however, the effect is beyond all calculation greater than the cause, supposing the latter to be only a mechanical percussion, as in the case of hammering iron till it be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> hot. By a few strokes of a hammer, the particles of a piece of iron, we shall allow, may be set in a violent motion, and thus produce fire. If, however, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the motion of these particles upon another body whose parts are at rest, and in some degree coherent, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> resist and diminish that motion of the particles already moved, in proportion to their vis inertiae, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> of the parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> body; if indeed we can suppose the vis\n\ninertiae of matter to be different from the effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>, cohesion, or some other power acting upon it. By no argumentation whatever, then, can we show upon mechanical principles, why fire should have such a tendency to increase and multiply itself without end, as we see it has, even abstracting from all consideration of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> for continuing the action of fire.\n\nThe action of the air in augmenting and continuing the power of fire, seems scarce at all to have been considered by those who first undertook an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of the subject. It evidently gave rise to the Hutchisonian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, that fire, light, and air, were convertible into one another. This, however, is equally untenable with the mechanical hypothesis; for later discoveries have shown, that our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> is composed of two distinct fluids, only one of which is fit for supporting flame; and if we should suppose this to be the only proper air, it is in like manner demonstrated, that this pure fluid is not homogeneous, but composed of a gravitating and non-gravitating substance; the latter of which only has the properties of fire; so that this element is still as invisible as ever; nor can it be shown by any experiment that fire per se has ever been changed into a palpable or gravitating substance.\n\nThe experiments which first seemed to bring this dispute to a decision were those of Dr. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a>, concerning what he called latent heat; on which some other names, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> heat, specific fire, &c., have been bestowed, very little to the advancement of science in general. From these discoveries it appears, that fire may exist in bodies in such a manner as not to discover itself in any other way than by its action upon the minute parts of the body; but that suddenly this action may be changed in such a manner as no longer to be directed upon the particles of the body itself, but upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> objects; in which case we then perceive its action by our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of feeling, or discover it by the thermometer, and call it sensible heat. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, it must be owned, is improper; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the word heat, instead of fire, has produced some confusion, which it is not now easy to avoid in speaking on these subjects. By the word heat, we ought always to understand the effect of fire, or the fluid acting in a certain manner, rather than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> element itself, which, it is certain, from the experiments <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned, may exist in substances actually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> to the touch.\n\nFrom this discovery made by Dr. Black, along with many others in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a>, and recorded at length in various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, it is now almost universally allowed, that fire is a distinct fluid, capable of being transferred from one body to another. But when this was discovered, another question no less perplexing occurred, viz. what kind of a fluid it was; or whether it bears any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> to those with which we are better acquainted? Here we find two fluids, viz. the solar light, and the electric matter, both of which occasionally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> as fire, and which therefore seem likely to be all the same at bottom. By the vulgar, indeed, the matter has long ago been determined; and the rays of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> as well as the electrical fluid, have been promiscuously denominated elementary fire. Philosophers, indeed, have withheld their assent; though\ntheir reasons for so doing are by no means <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>.\n\nThe most strange suppositions, however, have been made concerning the nature of both those fluids; and on the most slender grounds imaginable, or rather, on no grounds at all, they have been supposed to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHLOGISTON\">phlogiston</a> itself, or to contain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> proportion of it. Mr Scheele went so far in this way as to form an hypothesis, which he endeavoured to support by some experiments, that fire is composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPHLOGISTICATED\">dephlogisticated</a> air and phlogiston. But it is now ascertained beyond all possibility of dispute that the result of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> is not fire, but fixed air; so that we need not take any farther notice of this hypothesis than just to observe, that it would have been altogether untenable, even though this discovery had not been made; because the dephlogisticated air itself is not a simple but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> substance, as has already been observed; and that in all cases of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a> the one part of the air is separated from the other.\n\nIt was long ago observed by Sir Isaac Newton, that heat was certainly conveyed by a medium more subtle than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> air; because two thermometers, one included in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a> of an air <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>, the other placed in the open air, at an equal distance from the fire, would grow equally hot in near the same time. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this, had he pursued the thought, was, that fire itself was equally present in all places, and as active where there was no terrestrial matter as where there was. New improvements in the air pump have enabled succeeding philosophers to make more perfect vacuums, such as it has been supposed even the electric matter cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through. It is not to be doubted, however, that, even there, the thermometer would be heated by a fire as well as in the open air. Fire, therefore, exits and acts where there is no other matter, and of consequence is a fluid per se, independent of every terrestrial substance, without being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> or compounded of any thing we are yet acquainted with. To determine the nature of the fluid, we have only to consider whether any other can be discovered which will pass through the perfect vacuum just mentioned, and act there as fire. Such a fluid we find in the solar light, which is well known to act even in vacuo as the most violent fire. The solar light will likewise act in the very same manner in the most intense cold; for M. de Saussure has found, that on the cold mountain top the sunbeams are equally, nay more powerful, than on the plain below. It appears, therefore, that the solar light will produce heat independent of any other substance whatever; that is, where no other body is present, at least as far as we can judge, except the light itself and the body to be acted upon. We cannot therefore avoid concluding, that a certain modification of the light of the sun is the cause which produces heat, expansion, vapour, &c. and answers to the rest of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> given in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of fire, and that independent of any other substance whatever.\n\nFor a further discussion of this subject, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a> and Electricity <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>.\n\nWild Fire, a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> or factious fire, which burns even under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and that with greater violence than out of it.\n\nIt is composed of sulphur, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPHTHA\">naphtha</a>, pitch, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, and bitumen; and is only extinguishable by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a> mixed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>, or by raw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIDES\">hides</a>.\n\nVol. VIII.

The French call it Greek fire, or Feu Grecques, because first used by the Greeks, about the year 660: as is observed by the Jesuit Petavius, on the authority of Nicetas, Theophanes, Cedrenus, &c.\n\nThe inventor, according to the same Jesuit, was an engineer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELIOPOLIS\">Heliopolis</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, named Callinicus, who first applied it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-fight commanded by Constantine Pogonates against the Saracens, near Cyzicus, in the Hellespont; and with such effect, that he burnt the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> therewith wherein were 30,000 men. But others will have it of a much older <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a>, and hold Marcus Graeculus the inventor: which opinion is supported by several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> both in the Greek and Roman writers, which shows it to have been anciently used by both these nations in their wars.\n\nConstantine's successors used it on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> occasions with equal advantage as himself: and what is remarkable enough is, that they were so happy as to keep the secret of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> to themselves, so that no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> knew it in the year 960.\n\nHugh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURGUNDY\">Burgundy</a>, demanding ships of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Leo, for the siege of Fresne, desired likewise the Greek fire.\n\nF.

Every body, lays that author, was affrighted with the Greek fire, which the Turks then prepared; and the secret whereof is now lost. They threw it out of a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a>; and sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> it with an odd sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>-bow, which was strongly bent by means of a handle or winch, of much greater force than the mere arm. That thrown with the mortar sometimes appeared in the air of the size of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUN\">tun</a>, with a long tail, and a noise like that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>. The French by degrees got the secret of extinguishing it, in which they succeeded several times.\n\nMachine for preserving from Fire. This machine consists of a pole, a rope, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASKET\">basket</a>. The pole is of fir, or a common scaffold pole, of any convenient length from 36 to 46 feet; the diameter at bottom, or greatest end, about five inches; and at the top, or smallest end, about three inches. At three feet from the top is a mortise through the pole, and a pulley fixed to it of nearly the same diameter with the pole in that part. The rope is about three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of an inch diameter, and twice the length of the pole, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> hook at one end, to pass through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> in the handle of the basket when used: it is put through the mortise over the pulley, and then drawn tight on each side to near the bottom of the pole, and made fast there till wanted. The basket should be of strong wicker-work, three feet and a half long, two feet and a half wide, rounded off at the corners, and four feet deep, rounding every way at the bottom. To the top of the basket is fixed a strong iron curve or handle, with an eye or ring in the middle; and to one side of the basket, near the top, is fixed a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> or guide-rope of about the length of the pole. When the pole is raised, and set against a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> over the window from which any persons are to escape, the manner of using it is so plain and obvious, that it needs not be described. The most convenient distance from the house for the foot\nof the pole to stand, where practicable, is about 12 or 14 feet. If two strong iron straps, about three feet long, rivetted to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> across spreading about 14 inches at the foot, were fixed at the bottom of the pole, this would prevent its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> round or slipping on the pavement. And if a strong iron hoop, or ferrule, rivetted (or welded) to a semicircular piece of iron spreading about 12 inches, and pointed at the ends, were fixed on at the top of the pole, it would prevent its sliding against the wall.\n\nWhen these two last mentioned irons are fixed on, they give the pole all the steadiness of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADDER\">ladder</a>; and because it is not easy, except to persons who have been used to it, to raise and set upright a pole of 40 feet or more in length, it will be convenient to have two small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a> or spars of about two inches diameter, fixed to the sides of the great pole at about two or three feet above the middle of it, by iron eyes rivetted to two plates so as to turn every way; the lower end of these spars to reach within a foot of the bottom of the great pole, and to have ferrules and short spikes to prevent sliding on the pavement, when used occasionally to support the great pole like a tripod. There should be two strong alli trundles let through the pole, one at four feet and one at five feet from the bottom, to stand out about eight inches on each side, and to serve as handles, or to twist the rope round in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a> a very heavy weight. If a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> and pulley were fixed at about the middle of the rope, above the other pulley, and the other part of the rope made to run <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a>, it would diminish any weight in the basket nearly one half, and be very useful in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> any person up, to the affluence of those in the chambers, or for removing any effects out of a chamber, which it might be dangerous to attempt by the stairs.\n\nIt has been proved, by repeated trials, that such a pole as we have been speaking of can be raised from the ground, and two or three persons taken out of the upper windows of a house, and set <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> safely in the street, in the space of 35 seconds, or a little more than half a minute. Sick and infirm persons, women, children, and many others, who cannot make use of a ladder, may be safely and easily brought down from any of the windows of a house on fire by this machine, and, by putting a short pole through the handles of the basket, may be removed to any distance without being taken out of the basket. The pole must always have the rope ready fixed to it, and may be conveniently laid up upon two or three iron hooks under any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> or gateway, and the basket should be kept at the watch-house. When the pole is laid up, the two spars should always be turned towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of it. The basket should be made of peeled rods, and the pole and spars painted of a light <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, to render it more visible when used in the night.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">Machines</a> for extinguishing Fire. In the year 1734, the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a> offered a premium of 20,000 crowns for the best method of stopping the progress of accidental fires; when one Mr Fuches, a German physician, made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> for that end, and the experiment was made on a house built on purpose of dry fir, at Legard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> were placed several tubs of tar and pitch, and a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of chips, all which were set on fire; flames issuing through the top of the house, windows, &c., when he threw in one of the barrels containing the preparation, which immediately quenched the flames; a second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a> entirely cleared the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> away; and the whole was executed to the satisfaction of the spectators, and to the no small satisfaction of the inventor, who was about to return home, when unexpectedly the flames broke out again, supposed to be occasioned by a small quantity of combustible matter being introduced and set on fire secretly by some malicious person. Upon this the wrong-headed mob fell upon Mr Fuches, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> him most unmercifully, so that he narrowly escaped with his life. He soon after left the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and never could be prevailed on (though strongly persuaded by some of the most eminent citizens) to return. It is said, another experiment of the same kind was tried in the year 1761 in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>; but rendered abortive through the perseverance of the populace.\n\nAttempts of a similar nature have met with a better reception in England. Of these the most successful was that of Mr Godfrey, whose contrivance is thus described by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBROSE\">Ambrose</a> Godfrey, grandson to the inventor:\n\n\"The machine to be employed consists of a small portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a> closely confined; which, when animated by fire, acts by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> force upon a proper medium, and not only divideth it into the minutest atoms, but disperseth it all in every direction, so as immediately to extinguish any fire within a certain distance. This medium is a liquor strongly impregnated with a preparation of antiphlogistic principles, which by their action upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> materials extinguish the flames and reduce them in general to the state of a black coal; and, by its opposite nature to fire, hinders the remaining sparks, notwithstanding the admixture of the air, from kindling the flames afresh. By this means, the great point is obtained, in giving sufficient time for totally extinguishing any remains of fire.\n\n\"They who presume that water only will perform this will find themselves greatly mistaken, as the draught of air will certainly rekindle the neighbouring materials, which are very fit to receive a fresh flame, the fire not being extinguished by the quantity of water, but rather by the expansion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a> of its particles. There are several sizes of these machines, from five to fifty pounds weight, in a portable and rather small compass, and may generally be carried to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> can go himself.\n\n\"But though these machines will prevent great fires by a timely application, they will not extinguish them after they have reached a frightful height, and several houses, perhaps near a whole street, are in flames. The floors must be standing, and access to the building safe, otherwise no person can be supposed to approach near enough to apply them in a proper manner. Every fire has its beginning for the most part in some apartment; and, as soon as discovered, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, instead of losing all presence of mind, should immediately apply one or more of these machines, which will then fully answer the intention. The proper time of applying them, supposes that they are ready at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. It will be in vain to think of fetching them from any considerable distance, as it will then be too late for them to perform any important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>: except indeed being the probable means of saving some adjacent house, by extinguishing\ntinguishing the flames as often as they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> out, till the building first on fire is totally consumed, and, by falling into ruins, leaves the other in perfect safety.\"\n\nOn the 19th of May 1761, at noon, Mr Godfrey's experiment for extinguishing fire, was tried in a house erected for that purpose, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>-le-bone. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> highnesses, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> William Henry, Prince Henry Frederick, a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of persons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and distinction, and many of the learned world, gave their attendance on this singular occasion. The house, which was of brick, consisted of three rooms one above another, a staircase, chimney, lath and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a> ceilings, and a kind of wainscoting round the rooms, of rough <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a>. Exactly at 12 o'clock the ground room, and that up one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of stairs, were set on fire by lighting the faggots and shavings laid in there for that purpose: in about 15 minutes the wainscot of the under room was thought to be sufficiently in flames, and three of the machines were thrown in; which, by almost immediate and sudden explosions, instantaneously extinguished the flames, and the very smoke in that apartment in a few minutes totally disappeared. By this time, the firemen, &c. who had the care of throwing in the machines, gave an alarm that the fireplace had taken fire, and that it was necessary directly to go to work upon the next room; which was accordingly done, and with the same effect. The experiment, however, hitherto did not universally satisfy: in the last instance especially it was thought to be too hastily put in execution; and the populace without side the paling, who were supposed to amount to near 20,000, and whose curiosity, from the very nature of their situation, remained much dissatisfied, began to grow rather riotous, and talked of a second bottle conjuror. For the sake of the experiment, therefore, and to remove all manner of doubt, Mr Godfrey consented to a third experiment in the upper room, which was entirely of wood. The flames were now suffered to get to a considerable height, and even the window frames destroyed, before the machines were thrown in: which, however, answered exactly as the former had done; and, being quite in sight of the out-standers, met with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> approbation.\n\nThese machines of Mr Godfrey's, it is evident, would be of great use in extinguishing fires on shipboard; and might be considered as a no less necessary part of a ship's lading, than her stores or ammunition.\n\nThe hint of these machines is said to have been taken by Dr Godfrey from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of one Zachary Grey, who exhibited machines similar to those of Dr Godfrey, before persons of the first rank, but without meeting with any encouragement. His machines were made of wood, and the liquor employed was only water, and consequently inferior to Dr Godfrey's in its power of extinguishing fire. The latter is said to have mixed his water with a certain quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> of vitriol, or with sal ammoniac. These machines, however, as already observed, are found to be only serviceable in the beginning of a fire. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> had fallen in, they had no effect.\n\nComposition for extinguishing Fire. For this purpose the following has been invented by M. Von Aken, of which the account is taken from Nicholson's Journal, vol. ii. 4to.\n\nBurnt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a> 30 lbs.\nGreen vitriol powdered 40\nCinabrefe or red ochre in powder 20\nPotter's clay, or other clay, also powdered 200\nWater 630\n\nWith 40 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of this mixture an artificial fire was extinguished under the direction of the inventor by three persons, which would have required the labour of 20 men and 1500 measures of common water. Sig. Fabbroni was commissioned to examine the value of this invention, and found in his comparative trials with engines of equal power, worked by the same number of men, that the mixture extinguished the materials in combustion in one-sixth part less time, and three-eighths less of fluid, than when common water was used. He observed, as might indeed have been imagined from the nature of the material, that the flame disappeared wherever the mixture fell, and that the saline, metallic, and earthy matters formed an impenetrable layer round the hot combustible matter, which prevented the access of the air, and consequently the renewal of the destructive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>.\n\nIt is scarcely probable that this practice in the large way, with an engine throwing upwards of 200 gallons (value about \u00a31. 10s.) each minute, would be thought of or adopted, or that a sufficient store of the materials would be kept in readiness; since at this rate the expenditure for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> would demand a provision to the amount of \u00a310l. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>. But in country places the process, or some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of it, might be applied with sufficient profit in the result; more especially if it be considered that common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> or alum, or such saline matter as can be had and mixed with the water, together with clay, chalk, or lime, ochreous earth or common mud, or even these last without any salt, may answer the purpose of the late with more or less effect, and extinguish an accidental fire with much greater speed and certainty than clear water would do.\n\nWater-Engine for Extinguishing Fire. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HYDROSTATICS\">Hydrostatics</a>.\n\nIn using this machine we have the following improvement by Dr Hoffman, which promises to be of great efficacy. As soon as the engine is in readiness to work, stir into the water that immediately is to be discharged, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> or eight pounds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEARL\">pearl</a> ashes in powder, and continue to add it in this manner as occasion requires; taking care that it be directed against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> or wainscot, &c. just beginning to burn, and not waited against the brick-work: or, where time will admit, dissolve any quantity of pearl ashes in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> with water, and as fast as it dissolves, which will be in a few minutes, mix a palpit with the water in the engine, pretty often; and whatever burning wood it is played upon, will be extinguished as if it was dipped in water, and will not burn afresh in the part extinguished.\n\nEasy Method of Extinguishing Fire in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIMNEYS\">Chimneys</a>. It is well known, that the inner parts of chimneys easily take fire; the foot that kindles therein emits a greater flame, according as the tunnel is more elevated, because the inferior air feeds the fire. If this air could therefore be suppressed, the fire would soon be extinguished. In order to this, some discharge a pitfall into the chimney, which produces no effect; others lay...\nunder the chimney a copper full of water; but the vapours that rise from it, far from extinguishing the fire, seem to give it new force. Water thrown into the chimney at top is equally of no effect, because it comes down through the middle of the tunnel, and not along the sides. It would be more advisable to stop with dung the upper orifices of the tunnel for quenching the fire. But the surest and readiest method is, to take a little gunpowder, and having humected it with spititle for binding it, to form it into small masses, and so throw it into the heart of the chimney. When it is burnt, and has produced a considerable vapour, a second, afterwards a third, are thrown, and so on, as much as is necessary. In a little time the fire is extinguished, and, as it were, choked by this vapour; and cakes of inflamed foot are seen to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> from the tunnel, till at last not the least vestige of fire appears.\n\nSecuring Buildings against Fire. Dr Hales proposes to check the progress of fires by covering the floors of the adjoining houses with earth. The proposal is founded on an experiment which he made with a fir board half an inch thick, part of which he covered with an inch depth of damp garden mould, and then lighted a fire on the surface of the mould; though the fire was kept up by blowing, it was two hours before the board was burnt through, and the earth prevented it from flaming. The thicker the earth is laid on the floors, the better; however, Dr Hales apprehends that the depth of an inch will generally be sufficient; and he recommends to lay a deeper covering on the stairs, because the fire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> ascends by them with the greatest velocity.\n\nMr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARTLEY\">Hartley</a> made several trials in the years 1775 and 1776, in order to evince the efficacy of a method which he had invented for restraining the spread of fire in buildings. For this purpose thin iron plates are well nailed to the tops of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOISTS\">joists</a>, &c., the edges of the sides and ends being lapped over, folded together, and hammered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>. Partitions, stairs, and floors, may be defended in the same manner; and plates applied to one side have been found sufficient. The plates are so thin as not to prevent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> from being nailed on the joists, in the same manner as if this preventive were not used: they are kept from rust by being painted or varnished with oil and turpentine. The expense of this addition, when extending through a whole building, is estimated at about five per cent. Mr Hartley has a patent for this invention, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> has voted a sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> towards defraying the expense of his numerous experiments. The same preservative may also be applied to ships, furniture, &c.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAHON\">Mahon</a> has also discovered and published a very simple and effectual method of securing every kind of building against all danger of fire. This method he has divided into three parts, viz. under-flooring, extra-lathing, and inter-securing.\n\nThe method of under-flooring is either single or double. In single under-flooring, a common strong lath of oak or fir, about one-fourth of an inch thick, should be nailed against each side of every joist, and of every main timber, supporting the floor which is to be secured. Other similar laths are then to be nailed along the whole length of the joists, with their ends butting against each other. The top of each of these laths or fillets ought to be at 1\u00bd inch below the top of the joists or timbers against which they are nailed; and they will thus form a sort of small ledge on each side of all the joists. These fillets are to be well bedded in a rough plaster hereafter mentioned, when they are nailed on, so that there may be no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between them and the joists; and the same plaster ought to be spread with a trowel upon the tops of all the fillets, and along the sides of that part of the joists which is between the top of the fillets and the upper edge of the joists. In order to fill up the intervals between the joists that support the floor, short pieces of common laths, whose length is equal to the width of these intervals, should be laid in the contrary direction to the joists, and close together in a row, so as to touch one another: their ends must rest upon the fillets, and they ought to be well bedded in the rough plaster, but are not to be fastened with nails. They must then be covered with one thick coat of the rough plaster, which is to be spread over them to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the tops of the joists; and in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> or two this plaster should be trowelled over close to the sides of the joists, without covering the tops of the joists with it.\n\nIn the method of double flooring, the fillets and short pieces of laths are applied in the manner already described; but the coat of rough plaster ought to be little more than half as thick as that in the former method. Whilst this rough plaster is laid on, some more of the short pieces of laths above mentioned must be laid in the intervals between the joists upon the first coat, and be dipped deep in it. They should be laid as close as possible to each other, and in the same direction with the first layer of short laths. Over this second layer of short laths there must be spread another coat of rough plaster, which should be trowelled level with the tops of the joists without rising above them. The rough plaster may be made of coarse lime and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>; or, instead of hair, hay chopped to about three inches in length may be substituted with advantage. One measure of common rough sand, two measures of flaked lime, and three measures of chopped hay, will form in general a very good proportion, when sufficiently beat up together in the manner of common mortar. The hay should be put in after the two other ingredients are well beat up together with water. This plaster should be made stiff; and when the flooring boards are required to be laid down very soon, a fourth or fifth part of quicklime in powder, formed by dropping a small quantity of water on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a> a little while before it is used, and well mixed with this rough plaster, will cause it to dry very fast. If any cracks appear in the rough plaster work near the joists when it is thoroughly dry, they ought to be closed by washing them over with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> wet with mortar wash: this wash may be prepared by putting two measures of quicklime and one of common sand in a pail, and stirring the mixture with water till it becomes of the consistence of a thin jelly.\n\nBefore the flooring boards are laid, a small quantity of very dry common sand should be strewn over the plaster work, and struck smooth with a hollow rule, moved in the direction of the joists, so that it may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> rounding between each pair of joists. The plaster work and sand should be perfectly dry before the boards are laid, for fear of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRY_ROT\">dry rot</a>. The method\nof under-flooring may be successfully applied to a wooden staircase; but no sand is to be laid upon the rough plaster work. The method of extra-lathing may be applied to ceiling joists, to sloping roofs, and to wooden partitions.\n\nThe third method, which is that of inter-securing, is very similar to that of under-flooring; but no sand is afterwards to be laid upon it. Inter-securing is applicable to the same parts of a building as the method of extra-lathing, but it is seldom necessary.\n\nLord Mahon has made several experiments in order to demonstrate the efficacy of these methods. In most houses it is only necessary to secure the floors; and the extra expense of under-flooring, including all materials, is only about ninepence per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> yard, and with the use of quicklime a little more. The extra expense of extra-lathing is no more than sixpence per square yard for the timber side walls and partitions; but for the ceiling about ninepence per square yard. But in most houses no extra lathing is necessary.\n\n**Fire-Eater.** We have a great number of mountebanks who have procured the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> and wonder of the public by eating fire, walking on fire, washing their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> in melted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, and the like tricks.\n\nThe most celebrated of these was our countryman Richardson, much talked of abroad. His secret, as related in the *Journal des Scavans*, of the year 1682, consisted in a pure spirit of sulphur, wherewith he rubbed his hands, and the parts that were to touch the fire; which burning and cauterizing the epidermis, hardened and enabled the skin to resist the fire.\n\nIndeed this is no new thing: Amb. Pare\u00e9 assures us he has tried it on himself; that after washing the hands in urine, and with unguentum aureum, one may safely wash them in melted lead.\n\nHe adds also, that by washing his hands in the juice of onions, he could bear a hot shovel on them while it melted lead.\n\n**Fire, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">Theology</a>.** See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELL\">Hell</a>.\n\nWe read of the sacred fire in the first temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, which came down from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>; it was kept with the utmost care, and they were forbidden to carry any strange fire into the temple. This fire is one of the five things which the Jews confess were wanting in the second temple.\n\nThe Pagans had their sacred fires, which they kept in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> with the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> care, and which were never to be extinguished. Numa was the first who built a temple to Fire as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GODDESS\">goddess</a> at Rome, and instituted an order of priestesses for the preservation of it. See Vestals.\n\nFire was the supreme god of the Chaldeans; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGI\">Magi</a> were worshippers of fire; and the Greeks and Armenians still keep up a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> called the holy fire, upon a persuasion that every Easter day a miraculous fire descends from heaven into the holy sepulchre, and kindles all the lamps and candles there.\n\n**Fire kindled spontaneously in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">Human</a> Body.** See Extraordinary Cases of Burning.\n\n**Fire-Barrel.** See Fire-Ship, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">Note</a> (B).\n\n**Fire-Bowins.** Ibid. Note (D).\n\n**Fire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARROW\">Arrow</a>,** in naval <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>, is a small iron dart furnished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> and bars, together with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> impregnated with sulphur and powder, which is wound about its shaft. It is intended to fire the sails of the enemy, and is for this purpose discharged from a musketoon or swivel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUN\">gun</a>. The match being kindled by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a>, communicates the flame to the sail against which it is directed, where the arrow is fastened by means of its bars and springs. This weapon is peculiar to hot climates, particularly the West Indies, where the sails being extremely dry by reason of the great heat, they instantly take fire, and of course set fire to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASTS\">masts</a> and rigging, and lastly to the vessel itself.\n\n**Fire-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">Ball</a>,** in artillery, a composition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a> powder, sulphur, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALTPETRE\">saltpetre</a>, pitch, &c. about the bigness of a hand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRENADE\">grenade</a>, coated over with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>, and primed with the flow composition of a fuze. This is to be thrown into the enemy's works in the night time, to discover where they are, or to fire housetops, galleries, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-BLINDS\">blinds</a> of the besiegers; but they are then armed with spikes, or hooks of iron, that they may not roll off, but stick or hang where they are desired to have any effect. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FIRE_BALLS\">Fire-Balls</a>, and Light-Balls.\n\n**Balls of Fire,** in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEOROLOGY\">Meteorology</a>, a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> bodies generally appearing at a great height above the earth, with a splendour surpassing that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>; and sometimes equalling her apparent size. They generally proceed in this hemisphere from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> to south with vast velocity, frequently breaking into several smaller ones, sometimes vanishing with a report, sometimes not.\n\nThese luminous appearances no doubt constitute one part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> prodigies, blazing stars or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMETS\">comets</a>, which last they sometimes resemble in being attended with a train; but frequently they appear with a round and well-defined disk. The first of these of which we have any accurate account, was observed by Dr Halley and some other philosophers at different places, in the year 1719. From the flight observations they could take of its course among the stars, the perpendicular height of this body was computed at about 70 miles from the surface of the earth. The height of others has also been computed, and found to be various; though in general it is supposed to be beyond the limits assigned to our atmosphere, or where it loses its refractive power. The most remarkable of these on record appeared on the 18th of August 1783, about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> o'clock in the evening. It was seen to the northward of Shetland, and took a southerly direction for an immense space, being observed as far as the southern provinces of France, and one account says that it was seen at Rome also. During its course it appears frequently to have changed its shape; sometimes appearing in the form of one ball, sometimes of two or more; sometimes with a train, sometimes without one. It passed over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> nearly in the zenith, and had then the appearance of a well-defined round body, extremely luminous, and of a greenish colour; the light which it diffused on the ground giving likewise a greenish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> to objects. After passing the zenith it was attended by a train of considerable length, which continually augmenting, at last obliterated the head entirely; so that it looked like a wedge, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> with the obtuse end foremost. The motion was not apparently swift, by reason of its great height; though in reality it must have moved with great rapidity, on account of the vast space it travelled over in a short time. In other places its appearance\npearance was very different. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a> we are told, that \"two bright balls <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to each other led the way, the diameter of which appeared to be about two feet; and were followed by an expulsion of eight others, not elliptical, seeming gradually to mutilate, for the last was small. Between each two balls a luminous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERRATED\">serrated</a> body extended, and at the last a blaze issued which terminated in a point. Minute particles dilated from the whole. The balls were tinted first by a pure bright light, then followed a tender <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, mixed with azure, red, green, &c.; which, with a coalition of bolder tints, and a reflection from the other balls, gave the most beautiful rotundity and variation of colours that the human eye could be charmed with. The sudden illumination of the atmosphere, and the form and singular transition of this bright luminary, tended much to make it awful: nevertheless, the amazing vivid appearance of the different balls, and other rich connective parts not very easy to delineate, gave an effect equal to the rainbow in the full zenith of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>.\"\n\nDr Blagden, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on this subject in the 74th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Philosophical Transactions, has not only given a particular account of this and other meteors of the kind, but added several conjectures relating to the probable causes of them. The first thing which occurred to philosophers on this subject was, that the meteors in question were burning bodies rising from the surface of the earth, and flying along the atmosphere with great rapidity. But this hypothesis was soon abandoned, on considering that there was no power known by which such bodies could either be raised to a sufficient height, or projected with the velocity of the meteors. The next hypothesis was, that they do not consist of one single body, but of a train of sulphurous vapours, extending a vast way through the atmosphere, and being kindled at one time display the luminous appearances in question by the fire running from one end of the train to the other. To this hypothesis, which was invented by Dr Halley, Dr Blagden objects that no just explanation is given of the nature of the vapours themselves, the manner in which they are raised up, or in which they can be regularly arranged in straight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of such vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>; or how they can be supposed to burn in such rarefied air. \"Indeed, (says he) it is very difficult to conceive how vapours could be prevented, in those regions where there is in a manner no pressure, from spreading out on all sides in consequence of their natural elasticity, and instantly losing that degree of density which seems necessary for inflammation. Besides, it is to be expected, that such trains would sometimes take fire in the middle, and thus present the phenomenon of two meteors at the same time, receding from one another in a direct line.\"\n\nFor these and other reasons this hypothesis of Dr Halley was abandoned, and another substituted in its place. This was, that the meteors we speak of are permanent solid bodies, not rising from the earth, but revolving round it in very eccentric orbits, and thus in their perigee moving with inconceivable rapidity. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> shows, that even on this supposition, the velocity of such bodies must scarce be one third of that with which fire-balls move, and which has been calculated at upwards of 1000 miles per minute. The hypothesis is likewise liable to a number of other objections which cannot be answered, particularly from the variations in their appearance; for it is impossible to show in what manner one solid and permanent body could assume the appearance of eight or ten, as was the case with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEOR\">meteor</a> of 1783: nor can it be shown why a body, which in passing over Edinburgh appeared with a disk evidently less than that of the sun, should, in passing over Greenwich, assume the appearance of two bodies, each of which had a disk considerably larger than the apparent disk of that luminary. To obviate, in some measure, objections of this kind, it has been supposed that the revolving bodies are surrounded by a kind of electrical atmosphere by which they are rendered luminous; \"but (says the doctor) I think, whoever carefully peruses the various accounts of fire-balls, and especially ours of the 18th of August, when it divided, will perceive that their phenomena do not correspond with the idea of a solid nucleus involved in a subtile fluid, any more than with the idea of another learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, that they become luminous by means of a contained fluid, which occasionally explodes through the thick solid outer shell.\"\n\nAnother hypothesis, which Dr Blagden has not mentioned, is, that the meteors in question are a kind of bodies which take fire as soon as they come within the atmosphere of the earth. But this cannot be supposed, without implying a previous knowledge of these bodies, which it is altogether impossible we can have. The only opportunity we have of seeing them is when they are on fire. Before that time they are in an invisible and unknown state; and it is surely improper to argue concerning them in this state, or pretend to determine any one of their properties, when we have it not in our power to see or investigate them in the least. As the meteors therefore never manifest themselves to our senses but when they are on fire, the only rational conclusion we can draw from thence is, that they have no existence in any other state; and consequently that their substance must be composed of that fluid which, when acting after a certain manner, becomes luminous and shows itself as fire; remaining invisible and eluding our researches in every other case. On this hypothesis we must conclude that the fire-balls are great bodies of electric matter, moving from one part of the heavens where, to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, it is superabundant, to another where it is deficient. This opinion is adopted by Dr Blagden for the following reasons:\n\n1. On account of their prodigious velocity, which is not less than 1200 miles in a minute, and seems <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with any other substance we know besides the electric fluid. \"This (says he) is perhaps the only case in which the course or direction of that fluid is rendered perceptible to our senses, in consequence of the large scale on which these meteors move.\"\n\n2. Various electrical phenomena have been observed to attend them, such as lambent fires settling upon men, horses, &c., and sparks coming from them, \"or the whole meteor itself (adds our author), it is said, have damaged ships, houses, &c., after the manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>.\" This last circumstance, however, we can believe only of another kind of fire-balls, of which we shall afterwards treat, which keep at a small distance from the earth, or run along its surface; for the great meteors\nmeteors of which we now speak, flying at the distance of 50 or 60, or more, miles from the surface of the earth, cannot be less than their apparent size than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> or a mile and a half in diameter. Such an immense body of electric matter descending on the earth, would by its explosion ruin a large tract of country; and there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> that when engendered in such a rare atmosphere it could break through the whole body of gases and dense air which lies between these regions and the earth, and which we know resists the passage of the electric fluid very strongly. Notwithstanding this, there is no impossibility that the atmosphere may be electrified to a great degree by such a meteor passing over it; and thus electrified appearances may attend these bodies without any actual emission of their substance, as Dr Blagden supposes. \"If there be really (says he) any hissing noise heard while the meteors are passing, it seems explicable on no other supposition than that of streams of electric matter issuing from them, and reaching the earth with a velocity equal to that of the meteor, namely, in two or three seconds. Accordingly, in one of our late meteors, the hissing was compared to that of electricity issuing from a conductor. The sparks flying off so perpetually from the body of fire-balls may possibly have some connexion with these streams. In the same manner the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> of explosions may perhaps be brought to us quicker than if it were propagated to us by the air alone. Should these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> be well founded, the change of direction, which meteors seem at times to undergo, may possibly be influenced by the state of the surface of the earth over which they are passing, and to which the streams are supposed to reach. A similar cause may occasion the apparent explosion, the opening of more channels giving new vent and motion to the electric fluid. May not the deviation and explosion which appear to have taken place in the fire-ball of the 18th of August over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLNSHIRE\">Lincolnshire</a>, have been determined by its approach towards the fens, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> produced by that large body of moisture?\n\nThe explosion mentioned by our author over Lincolnshire does not seem to have been the only one which happened during the course of this meteor. Several people heard reports after it had vanished; and these were sometimes single and sometimes double. At Edinburgh two reports were heard, the one immediately following the other, at the distance of six or seven minutes after the meteor had passed. These reports no doubt indicated a temporary dilution of the body; but it is by no means probable that the dilution could have taken place either on account of the state of the earth or atmosphere. We must consider that both earth and atmosphere are always full of electric fluid; and if there happens to be what is called a deficiency in one of them, the other instantly supplies it. It is impossible, therefore, that either the earth or atmosphere could receive such an immense additional quantity in one part without a vent being provided for it somewhere else. In thunderstorms we naturally conclude that a vast quantity of electrical matter is put in motion; but from the effects of lightning it appears that this quantity must be very trifling in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with what the meteor we now speak of contained. A violent flash of lightning has been known to perforate a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a>-glass, and make only a hole of about an inch diameter. Now we have no reason to suppose that the flash, tremendous as it might appear to our eyes, was any other than an electric spark of an inch in diameter. The meteor, on the other hand, appears not to have been less than a mile in diameter; so that the disproportion between it and a single flash of lightning appears almost beyond calculation; and we may reasonably conclude that it could not have been equalled by 10,000 thunder-storms. Had this amazing body of electric fire descended through the atmosphere and dissipated itself on the fens of Lincolnshire, it must have produced the most violent and unheard-of effects, not only in that place, but probably throughout the whole island. Its dissipation must therefore have been in the higher regions, where there was ample space to receive it; and where its explosion, whatever conclusion it might make among the ethereal matter itself, could not affect our earth or atmosphere in any remarkable degree. Its re-appearance was owing to the same tendency in the fluid to circulate which had originally produced it; and which probably was the violent earthquake in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALABRIA\">Calabria</a>, and the eruption in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ICELAND\">Iceland</a>.\n\n3. Another argument adduced by Dr Blagden in favour of the electrical origin of fire-balls, is their connexion with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-AURORA_BOREALIS\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA\">aurora</a> borealis, and the resemblance they bear to these phenomena, which are now almost universally allowed to be electrical. \"Instances (says he) are recorded, where northern lights have been seen to join, and form luminous balls, darting about with great velocity, and even leaving a trail behind them like the common fire-balls. This train I take to be nothing else but the rarefied air left in such an electrified state as to be luminous; and some streams of the northern lights are very much like it.\" The aurora borealis appears to occupy as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, if not a higher region above the surface of the earth, as may be judged from the very distant countries to which it has been visible at the same time: indeed the great accumulation of electric matter seems to lie beyond the verge of our atmosphere, as estimated by the cessation of twilight. Also with the northern lights a hissing noise is said to be heard in some very cold climates; Gmelin speaks of it in the most pointed terms, as frequent and very loud in the north-eastern parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>; and other travellers have related similar facts.\"\n\n4. Our author thinks that the strongest argument for the electrical origin of these meteors is the direction of their course, which is constantly either from the north or north-west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the heavens, or towards it; or, as our author thinks, nearly in the direction of the magnetic meridian. Such a course, however, seems only to belong to the very large fire-balls of which we now speak; the smaller ones, called Falling Stars, being moved in all directions; \"perhaps (says the doctor), because they come further within the verge of our atmosphere, and are thereby exposed to the action of extraneous causes. That the smaller sort of meteors, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> stars, are really lower down in the atmosphere, is rendered very probable by their swifter apparent motion; perhaps it is this very circumstance which occasions them to be smaller, the electric fluid being more divided in more resisting air. But as those masses of electric matter which move\nwhere there is scarce any resistance, so generally affect the direction of the magnetic meridian, the ideas which have been entertained of some analogy between these two obscure powers of nature seem not altogether without foundation. If the foregoing conjectures be just, distinct regions are allotted to the electrical phenomena of our atmosphere. Here below we have thunder and lightning, from the unequal distribution of the electric fluid among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>; in the loftier regions, whither the clouds never reach, we have the various gradations of falling flares; till, beyond the limits of our corporeal atmosphere, the fluid is put into motion in sufficient masses, to hold a determined course, and exhibit the different appearances of what we call fire-balls; and probably at a still greater elevation above the earth, the electricity accumulates in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> and less condensed form, to produce the wonderfully diversified streams and coruscations of the aurora borealis.\"\n\nThe paper from whence these extracts are taken was written before Mr Morgan's account of the non-conducting power of a perfect vacuum made its appearance. The meteor in question, and others of the same nature, afford a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of the deficiency of electric fluid proposed by some. Dr Halley, speaking of the fire-ball of 1719, the height of which he calculated at very little less than 70 miles, expresses his surprise that found should be propagated through a medium near 300,000 times rarer than the common air, and the next thing to a perfect vacuum. Now it remains, and for ever will remain, to be proved, that Mr Morgan's most perfect vacuum, formed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> quicksilver in a tube ever so long, contains a medium more than 300,000 times rarer than the common atmosphere.\n\nFrom Mr Cavallo's experiments it appears, that when air is only rarefied 1000 times, the electric light is excessively weak; so that there is not the least probability that in an aerial medium 300,000 times rarer than the present, if indeed such a medium can exist, there could be any light made visible in the ordinary experiments. We see, however, by the many examples of meteors which have occurred at prodigious heights in the atmosphere, that the electric light in such a rarefied atmosphere is not only visible, but acts as vigorously in every respect as if it were on the surface of the earth. This circumstance therefore affords a complete demonstration of the fallacy of Mr Morgan's argument, and a direct proof that the electric fluid pervades space as completely divested of air as the best artificial vacuum we can make; nay, where it is generally believed by mathematicians that the atmosphere has ceased altogether. His other arguments drawn a priori are still more inconclusive than that we have just mentioned. He tells us, that if a vacuum was a conductor, the whole quantity of electric matter contained in the earth and atmosphere would be perpetually flying off through the regions of infinite space, as being surrounded by a boundless conductor. But even this does not follow, though we should suppose these regions to be an absolute vacuum; for we know that electricity does not fly to a conducting substance merely because it is a conductor, but because it opens a passage to some place whither it has a tendency to go though the conductor was not there. Now, on the present hypothesis, as the conductor would lead to no place to which the electric matter had any previous tendency, we cannot assign any reason why it should acquire a tendency to fly off merely on account of the neighbourhood of a conductor, even though boundless.\n\nHis other objection (that, on the supposition of a vacuum being capable of conducting electricity, the whole space in the universe would be filled with electric fluid) may be admitted in its fullest extent, without any detriment whatever to science; and indeed, if we allow the electric fluid to be only a modification of the light of the sun, we must own that the whole universe is filled with it. The meteors in question then will be no other than discharges of electricity from one part of the celestial spaces to another, similar to the discharges between the positive and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> side of an electrified bottle; thus intimating, that a circulation has taken place in the fluid, which the meteor at once completes and puts an end to. See Meteorology.\n\nBesides these already just mentioned of such vast magnitude, there are others much smaller and nearer the surface of the earth, rolling upon it, or falling upon it, exploding with violence, as is the case with those which appear in the time of thunder, and frequently produce mischievous effects. One of these is mentioned by some authors as falling in a serene evening in the island of Jamaica; exploding as soon as it touched the surface of the ground, and making a considerable hole in it. Another is mentioned by Dr Priestley as rolling along the surface of the sea, then rising and striking the top-mast of a man of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, exploding, and damaging the ship. In like manner, we hear of an electrified cloud at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAVA\">Java</a> in the East Indies; whence, without any thunder storm, there issued a vast number of fire-balls which did incredible mischief. This last phenomenon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out to us the true origin of balls of this kind, viz., an excessive accumulation of electricity in one part, or a violent tendency to circulate, when at the same time the place where the motion begins is at so great a distance, or meets with other obstacles of such a nature, that it cannot easily get thither. Urged on, however, by the vehement pressure from behind, it is forced to leave its place; but being equally unable to displace the great quantity of the same fluid, which has no inclination to move the same way with itself, it is collected into balls, which run hither and thither, according as they meet with conductors capable of leading them, into some part of the circle. This is even confirmed by an experiment related at the end of Dr Priestley's fifth volume on Air. He relates, that a gentleman having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a>, with a very powerful machine, a jar, which had the wire supporting the knob of a considerable length, and passed through the glass tube, a globe of fire was seen to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> out of it. This globe gradually ascended up the glass tube till it came to the top of the knob, where it settled, turning swiftly on its axis, and appearing like a red-hot iron ball of three quarters of an inch diameter. On continuing to turn the machine, it gradually descended into the jar; which it had no sooner done, than there ensued a most violent explosion and flash, the jar being discharged and broken at the same time. This experiment, however, is singular in its kind; for neither the gentleman who performed it, nor any other, has yet been able to repeat it. Single as it is, however, we may yet gather from it, that a fire-ball will be the consequence of a very\nvery violent electrification of any substance, provided at the same time that the air be in a very non-conducting state, so that the electricity may not evaporate into it as fast as it is collected; for this would produce only lucid streams and flashes, as in the common experiments with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a> phial; and it is probably an inattention to this circumstance which has hitherto prevented the repetition of the experiment above mentioned. The case is the same in thunder storms, where an excessive accumulation of electric matter always produces fire-balls, the most mischievous kind of lightning, as is explained under that article.\n\nWith regard to the uses which fire-balls serve in the system of nature, it is plain that they are the means of preserving the equilibrium in the electric fluid in the atmosphere, which would otherwise produce the most dreadful tempests. As there must be a constant current of electric matter through the bowels of the earth from the equator to the poles, and from the poles to the equator, through the atmosphere, the great meteors serve for keeping up the equilibrium in this great atmospheric current, while the smaller ones answer a like purpose in the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of electric matter dispersed over the surface of the earth, and therefore are seen to move in all directions, as the equilibrium happens to require them in different parts. With regard to those which are observed in the lower regions of the earth, or rolling on the surface of the ground itself, they undoubtedly answer purposes of a similar kind in these lower regions; for as fire-balls in general are produced by a great excess of electricity in one place, there must of course be an equal deficiency in another; and to restore the equilibrium, or, to speak more properly, to prevent a dangerous commotion from taking place throughout the whole mass of electric fluid, the fire-ball breaks forth, and either puts a stop at once to the disturbance by an explosion, or by a silent and invisible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>. From some accounts indeed it would seem that even the large celestial meteors detached part of their substance to accomplish this purpose; though, for the reasons already given, it would seem more probable that they operated by electrifying the atmosphere, or setting the fluid contained in it in motion, so as to produce small fire-balls of itself, rather than by detaching any part of their own bodies to such a distance. Dr Blagden, in the paper above quoted, gives an account of an appearance of this kind. It was described in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Banks from the Abb\u00e9 Mann, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a> of the academy at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSSELS\">Brussels</a>. \"It happened (says the Abb\u00e9) at Marienkirche, a small village on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, about half a mile west of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OSTEND\">Ostend</a>. The curate of the village was sitting in the dark of the evening with a friend, when a sudden light surprised them, and, immediately after, a small ball of light-colored flame came through a broken pane of glass, crossed the room where they were sitting, and fixed itself on the chink of a door opposite to the window where it entered, and there died gradually away. It appeared to be a kind of phosphoric light carried along by the current of air. The curate and his friend, greatly surprised at what they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>, apprehended fire in the neighborhood; but going out, found that the fire which had come in through the window had been detached from a large meteor in its passage.\"\n\nFire-Cocks.

The largest is more than an inch in length, having a very large head connected with the body by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> of a particular structure, with which at some times it makes a loud knock, particularly when laid on its back. The fly has two feelers or horns, two wings, and six legs. Under its belly is a circular patch, which, in the dark, shines like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a>; and on each side of the head near the eyes is a prominent, globular, luminous body, in size about one-third larger than a mustard seed. Each of these bodies is like a living <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a>, emitting a bright, and not faint, light; since two or three of these animals, put into a glass vessel, afford light sufficient to read without difficulty, if placed close to the book. When the fly is dead, these bodies will still afford considerable light, though it is less vivid than before; and if bruised, and rubbed over the hands or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, they become luminous in the dark, like a board smeared over with phosphorus. They have a reddish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> or chestnut color; and live in rotten trees in the day, but are always abroad in the night. The other kind is not more than half as large as the former; their light proceeds from under their wings, and is seen only when they are elevated, like sparks of fire appearing or disappearing at every second. Of these the air is full in the night, though they are never seen in the day. They are common not only in the southern but in the northern parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>.\n\nFire-Lock, or Fusil, a small gun which fires with a flint.

The distinguishing tenet from which they derived this appellation was, that the intimate essences of natural things were only to be known by the trying efforts of fire, directed in a chemical process. They were also called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEOSOPHISTS\">Theosophists</a>, from their declaring against human reason as a dangerous and deceitful guide, and representing a divine and supernatural illumination as the only means of arriving at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>; they were likewise denominated Paracelsists, from the name of Paracelsus, the eminent physician and chemist, who was the chief ornament and leader of this extraordinary sect. It was patronized in England by Robert Fludd or Fludd, who endeavored to illustrate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> of Paracelsus in a great number of treatises: in France it was zealously propagated by Rivier; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>, by Severinus; in Germany, by Kunrath, an eminent physician of Dresden; and in other\nother countries by warm and successful votaries, who assumed a striking air of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>, and professed to themselves no other end than the advancement of the divine glory, and the restoration of peace and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCORD\">concord</a> in a divided <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>; accordingly they were joined by several persons eminent for their piety, and distinguished by their zeal for the advancement of true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. One of the most celebrated of these was Daniel Hoffman, professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> in the university of Helmstadt, who, availing himself of some unguarded passages in the writings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a>, extravagantly maintained, that philosophy was the mortal enemy of religion; that truth was divisible into two branches, the philosophical and theological; and that what was true in philosophy was false in theology. Hoffman, was afterwards obliged, by the interposition of Henry Julius, duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUNSWICK\">Brunswick</a>, to retract his invectives against philosophy, and to acknowledge in the most open manner the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> and union of sound philosophy with true and genuine theology.\n\nFire-Places are contrivances for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> heat to rooms, and also for answering various purposes of art and manufacture. See Chimney, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FURNACE\">Furnace</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOVE\">Stove</a>.\n\nThe ingenious Dr Franklin, having recounted the inconveniences and advantages of fire-places in common use, proposes a new contrivance for this purpose, called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENNSYLVANIA\">Pennsylvania</a> fire-place.\n\n1. This machine consists of a bottom-plate, or hearth-piece, fig. 1. Plate CCXVII, with a rising moulding before for a fender, two perforated ears F, G, for receiving two screw-rods; a long air-hole a, through which the outward air passes into an air-box; and three smoke-holes, represented by dark squares in BC, through which the smoke descends and passes away; besides, double ledges for receiving between them the lower edges of the other plates. 2. A back-plate without holes, and furnished with a pair of ledges to receive, 3. The two side-plates, each of which has a pair of ledges to receive the side edges of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> plate, with a shoulder on which it rests; two pair of ledges to receive the side edges of the two middle plates which form the air-box, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> air-hole near the top, through which the air warmed in the box is discharged into the room, and a wing or bracket as H, and a small hole as R, for the axis of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> to turn in. See fig. 2, which represents one of these plates. 4. An air-box, composed of the two middle plates DE and FG, fig. 3. and 4. The first has five thin ledges or partitions cast on it, the edges of which are received into so many pairs of ledges cast in the other: the tops of all the cavities formed by these thin deep ledges are also covered by a ledge of the same form and depth cast with them; so that when the plates are put together, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> luted, there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> between the air-box and the smoke. In the winding passages of this box, fresh air is warmed as it passes into the room. 5. A front plate, which is arched on the under side, and ornamented with foliages, &c. 6. A top plate with a pair of ears, MN, (fig. 5.) answerable to those in the bottom plate, and perforated for the same purpose. It has also a pair of ledges running round the under side to receive the top edges of the front, back, and side plates. The air-box does not reach up to the top plate by 2\u00bd inches.\n\nAll these plates are of cast iron; and when they are all in their proper places, they are bound firmly together by a pair of slender rods of wrought iron with screws, and the machine appears as in fig. 5. There are also two thin plates of wrought iron, viz. 7. The shutter which is of such a length and breadth as to close well the opening of the fire-place, and serving to blow up the fire, and to secure it in the night. It is raised or depressed by means of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> knobs, and slides in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a> left between the foremost ledge of the side plates and the face of the front plate. 8. The register, which is placed between the back plate and air-box, and furnished with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEY\">key</a>; so that it may be turned on its axis, and made to lie in any position between level and upright. The operation of this machine, and the method of fixing it, may be understood by observing the profile of the chimney and fire-places in fig. 6. M is the mantle-piece or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> of the chimney; C the funnel; B the false back, made of brick work in the chimney, four inches or more from the true back, from the top of which a capping is to be made over to the breast of the chimney, that no air may pass into the chimney except that which goes under the false back, and up behind it: E the true back of the chimney; T the top of the fire-place; F the front of it; A the place where the fire is made; D the air-box; K the hole in the side plate, through which the warmed air is discharged out of the air-box into the room; H the hollow, formed by removing some bricks from the hearth under the bottom plate filled with fresh air, entering at the passage I, and ascending into the air-box through the air-hole in the bottom plate near G, the partition in the hollow, designed to keep the air and smoke apart; P the passage under the false back, and part of the hearth for the smoke; and the arrows in the figure show the course of the smoke. The fire being made at A, the flame and smoke will ascend, strike the top T, and give it a considerable heat; the smoke will turn over the air box, and descend between it and the back plate to the holes near G in the bottom plate, heating in its passage all the plates of the machine; it will then proceed under and behind the false back, and rise into the chimney. The air of the room contiguous to the several plates, and warmed by them, becomes specifically lighter than the other air in the room, and is obliged to rise; but being prevented by the closure over the fire-place from going up the chimney, is forced out into the room, and rising by the mantle-piece to the ceiling, is again driven down gradually by the steam of newly-warmed air that follows; and thus the whole room becomes in a little time equally warmed. The air also, warmed under the bottom plate and in the air-box, rises and comes out of the holes in the side plates, thus warming and continually changing the air of the room. In the capping of the chimney, a square opening for a trap-door should be left for the sweeper to go up: the door may be made of slate or tin, and so placed, that by turning up against the back of the chimney when open, it closes the vacancy behind the false back, and prevents the foot that falls in sweeping out upon the hearth. It will also be convenient to have a small hole, about five or six inches square, cut near the ceiling through into the funnel, and provided with a shutter; by occasionally opening which,\nwhich, the heated air of the room and smoke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>, &c., may be carried off without inconveniencing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>. For a farther account of the manner of using this fire-place, the advantages attending it, answers to objections, and directions to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRICKLAYER\">bricklayer</a> in fixing it, the curious reader may consult Franklin's Letters and Papers on Philosophical Subjects, p. 284\u2014318, edit. 1769.\n\n**Fire-Pots**, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> art, small earthen pots, into which is put a charged grenade, and over that powder enough till the grenade is covered; then the pot is covered with a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARCHMENT\">parchment</a>, and two pieces of match across lighted: this pot being thrown by a handle of matches where it is designed, it breaks and fires the powder, and burns all that is near it, and likewise fires the powder in the grenade, which ought to have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUSE\">fuse</a>, to the end its operations may be the quicker.\n\n**Fire-Reeds.** See the next article, Note (c).\n\n**Fire-Ship,** an old vessel filled with combustible materials, and fitted with grappling irons to hook, and set fire to, the enemies ships in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, &c.\n\nAs there is nothing particular in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of this ship, except the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> by which the fire is instantly conveyed from one part to another, and from thence to the enemy, it will be sufficient to describe the fire-room, where these combustibles are enclosed, together with the instruments necessary to grapple the ship intended to be destroyed.\n\nThe fire-room is built between decks, and limited on the after part by a bulk-head, L, behind the mainmast, from which it extends quite forward, as represented in Plate CCXVII. The train enclosed in this apartment is contained in a variety of wooden troughs, D, G, which intersect each other in different parts of the ship's length; being supported at proper distances by cross pieces and stanchions. On each side of the ship are fix or seven ports, H, about 18 inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> and 15 inches high; and having their lids to open downward, contrary to the usual method.\n\nAgainst every port is placed an iron chamber (A), which, at the time of firing the ship, blows out the port-lid, and opens a passage for the flame. Immediately under the main and fore-throats is fixed a wooden funnel M; whose lower end communicates with a fire-barrel (B), by which the flame passing through the funnel is conducted to the throats. Between the funnels, which are likewise called fire-trunks, are two scuttles, or small holes, in the upper deck, serving also to let out the flames. Both funnels must be stopped with plugs, and have sailcloth or canvas nailed close over them, to prevent any accident happening from above to the combustibles laid below.\n\nThe ports, funnels, and scuttles, not only communicate the flames to the outside and upper works of the ship and her rigging; but likewise open a passage for the inward air, confined in the fire-room, which is thereby expanded so as to force impetuously through those outlets, and prevent the blowing up of the decks, which must of necessity happen from such a sudden and violent rarefaction of the air as will then be produced.\n\nOn each side of the bulk-head behind is cut a hole, L, of sufficient size to admit a trough of the same dimensions as the others. A leading trough, LI, whose foremost end communicates with another trough within the fire-room, is laid close to this opening, from whence it extends obliquely to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALLY\">tally</a>-port, I, cut through the ship's side. The decks and troughs are well covered with melted rosin. At the time of the firing\n\n---\n\n(A) The iron chambers are 10 inches long and 3.5 in diameter. They are breeched against a piece of wood fixed across the ports, and let into another a little higher. When loaded, they are almost filled with corn-powder, and have a wooden tampion well driven into their muzzles. They are primed with a small piece of quick-match thrust through their vents into the powder, with a part of it hanging out. When the ports are blown open by means of the iron chambers, the port-lids either fall downward, or are carried away by the explosion.\n\n(B) The fire-barrels ought to be of a cylindrical form, as most suitable to contain the reeds with which they are filled, and more convenient for flowing them between the troughs in the fire-room. Their inside chambers should not be less than 21 inches, and 30 inches is sufficient for their length. The bottom parts are first well stored with short double-dipped reeds placed upright; and the remaining vacancy is filled with fire-barrel composition well mixed and melted, and then poured over them. The composition used for this purpose is a mass of sulphur, pitch, tar, and tallow.\n\nThere are five holes, of three-fourths of an inch in diameter and three inches deep, formed in the top of the composition while it is yet warm; one being in the centre, and the other four at equal distances round the sides of the barrel. When the composition is cold and hard, the barrel is primed by filling these holes with fuse composition, which is firmly driven into them, so as to leave a little vacancy at the top to admit a strand of quick match twice doubled. The centre hole contains two strands at their whole length, and every strand must be driven home with meafed powder. The loose ends of the quick match being then laid within the barrel, the whole is covered with a dipped curtain, fastened on with a hoop that slips over the head of the barrel, to which it is nailed.\n\nThe barrels should be made very strong, not only to support the weight of the composition before firing, when they are moved or carried from place to place, but to keep them together whilst burning: for if the staves are too light and thin, so as to burn very soon, the remaining composition will tumble out and be dissipated, and the intention of the barrels, to carry the flame aloft, will accordingly be frustrated.\n\nThe curtain is a piece of coarse canvas, nearly a yard in breadth and length, thickened with melted composition, and covered with saw-dust on both sides.\nfiring either of the leading troughs, the flame is immediately conveyed to the opposite side of the ship, whereby both sides burn together.\n\nThe spaces N, O, behind the fire-room, represent the cabins of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> and mailer, one of which is on the starboard, and the other on the larboard side. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>'s cabin, which is separated from these by a bulk-head, is exhibited also by P.\n\nFour of the eight fire-barrels are placed under the four fire-trunks; and the other four between them, two on each side the fire-ducts, where they are securely cleated to the deck. The longest reeds (c) are put into the fore and aft trough, and tied down: the shortest reeds are laid in the troughs athwart, and tied down also. The bavins (v), dipped at one end, are tied fast to the troughs over the reeds, and the curtains are nailed up to the beams, in equal quantities, on each side of the fire-room.\n\nThe remainder of the reeds are placed in a position nearly upright, at all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> of every square in the fire-room, and there tied down. If any reeds are left, they are to be put round the fire-barrels, and other vacant places, and there tied fast.\n\nInstructions to Prime.\n\nTake up all your reeds, one after another, and strew a little composition at the bottom of all the troughs under the reeds, and then tie them gently down again: next strew composition upon the upper part of the reeds throughout the fire-room; and upon the said composition lay double quick match upon all the reeds, in all the troughs: the remainder of the composition strew over all the fire-room, and then lay your bavins loofe.\n\nCast off all the covers of the fire-barrels, and hang the quick match loofe over their sides, and place leaders of quick match from the reeds into the barrels, and from thence into the vent of the chambers, in such a manner as to be certain of their blowing open the ports, and setting fire to the barrels. Two troughs of communication from each door of the fire-room to the fally ports, must be laid with a strong leader of quick-match, four or five times double: also a cross-piece to go from the fally-port, when the ship is fired, to the communication trough, laid with leaders of quick-match, that the fire may be communicated in both sides at once.\n\nWhat quick-match is left place so that the fire may be communicated to all parts of the room at once, especially about the ports and fire-barrels, and see that the chambers are well and fresh primed. [N. B. The port-fire used for firing the ship, burns about 12 minutes. Great care must be taken to have no powder on board when the ship is fired.]\n\nThe sheer hooks (represented by A) are fitted so as to fasten on the yard-arms of the fire-ship, where they hook the enemy's rigging. The fire-grapplings (B) are either fixed on the yard-arms, or thrown by hand, having a chain to confine the ships together, or fasten those instruments wherever necessary.\n\nWhen the commanding officer of a fleet displays the signal to prepare for action, the fire-ships fix their sheer hooks, and dispose their grapplings in readiness. The battle being begun, they proceed immediately to prime, and prepare their fire-works. When they are ready for grappling, they inform the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a> thereof by a particular signal.\n\nTo avoid being disabled by the enemy's cannon during a general engagement, the fire-ships continue sufficiently distant from their line of battle, either to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINDWARD\">windward</a> or to leeward.\n\nThey cautiously shun the openings or intervals of the line, where they would be directly exposed to the enemy's fire, from which they are covered by lying on the opposite side of their own ships. They are attentively to observe the signals of the admiral or his seconds, in order to put their designs immediately in execution.\n\nAlthough no ship of the line should be previously appointed to protect any fire-ship, except a few of the smallest particularly destined to this service, yet the ship before whom she passes in order to approach the enemy, should escort her thither, and assist her with an armed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>, or whatever succour may be necessary in her situation.\n\nThe captain of the fire-ship should himself be particularly attentive that the above instructions are punctually executed, and that the yards may be so braced when he falls alongside of the ship intended to be destroyed, that the sheer-hooks and grapplings fastened to the yard-arms, &c., may effectually hook the enemy. He is expected to be the last person who quits the vessel; and being furnished with every necessary assistance and support, his reputation will greatly depend on the success of his enterprise.\n\nLambent Fires, as the shining of meat at certain seasons, the luminousness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>, of insects, vapours, &c.

See Spur-Fire.\n\nFire-Works, are preparations made of gunpowder, sulphur,\n\n(c) The reeds are made up in small bundles of about a foot in circumference, cut even at both ends, and tied together in two places. They are distinguished into two kinds, viz. the long and short; the former of which are four feet, and the latter two feet five inches in length. One part of them are singly dipped, i.e. at one end; the rest are dipped at both ends in a kettle of melted composition. After being immersed about seven or eight inches in this preparation, and then drained, they are sprinkled over with pulverized sulphur upon a tanned hide.\n\n(d) The bavins are made of birch, heath, or other brush-wood, which is tough and readily kindled. They are usually two or three feet in length, and have all their bush-ends lying one way, the other ends being tied together with small cords. They are dipped in composition at the bush-ends, whose branches are afterwards confined by the hand, to prevent them from breaking off by moving about; and also to make them burn more fiercely. After being dipped in the same manner as the reeds, they also are sprinkled with sulphur.\nFiring, sulphur, and other inflammable and combustible ingredients, used on occasion of public rejoicings and other solemnities.\n\nThe invention of fire-works is by M. Mahudel attributed to the Florentines and people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIENNA\">Sienna</a>; who found out likewise the method of adding decorations to them of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a>, with fire issuing from their eyes and mouths.\n\nThe art of preparing and managing these is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PYROTECHNY\">Pyrotechny</a>. See Pyrotechny.","sp":253,"ep":267},{"h":"FIRING","t":"in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> art, denotes the discharge of the fire-arms; and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> is to do the utmost execution to the enemy.\n\nThe method of firing by platoons is said to have been invented by Guglielmo Adolphus, and first used about the year 1618; the reason <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> given for this method is, that a constant fire may be always kept up. There are three different ways of platoon firing; viz. standing, advancing, and retreating. But previous to every kind of firing, each regiment <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> battalion must be told off in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> divisions, subdivisions, and platoons, exclusively of the grenadiers, which form two subdivisions or four platoons of themselves. In firing standing, either by divisions or platoons, the first fire is from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> or platoon on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> fire from the left; the third from the right again; and so on alternately, till the firing comes to the centre platoon, which is generally called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> platoon, and does not fire, remaining as a reserve for the colours. Firing advancing is performed in the same manner, with this addition, that before either division or platoon fires, it advances three paces forward. Firing retreating varies from either of the former methods; for before either division or platoon fires, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they are marching from the enemy, it must go to the right about, and after firing, to the left about again, and continue the retreat as slow and orderly as possible.\n\nIn hedge firing the men are drawn up two deep, and in that order both ranks are to fire standing. Oblique firing is either to the right and left, or from the right and left to the centre, according to the situation of the object. The Prussians have a particular contrivance for this purpose; if they are to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> to the right, the rear ranks of every platoon make two quick but small paces to the left, and the body of each soldier turns one-eighth of a circle, and vice versa. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAPET\">Parapet</a> firing depends on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the parapet over which the men are to fire, and also upon that of the attack made to protect it. This method of firing is sometimes performed by single ranks stepping on the banquette and firing; each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> instantly handing his arms to the centre <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILE\">file</a>, and taking his back in the room of it; and the centre rank giving it to the rear to load, and forwarding the arms of the rear to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> rank; by which means the front rank men can fire six or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROUNDS\">rounds</a> in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> with exactness. Parapet firing may also be executed two deep, when the banquette is three feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, or in field works where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> banquettes are made. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">Square</a> firing is performed by a regiment or body of men drawn up in a hollow square, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> each front is generally divided into four divisions or firings, and the flanks of the square, being the weakest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>, are covered by four platoons of grenadiers. The first fire is from the right division of each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>; the second from the left division of each face, &c. and the grenadiers make the last fire. Street firing is practised in two ways; either by making the division or platoon that has fired to wheel by half-rank to the right and left outwards from the centre, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> in that order by half divisions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the flanks on each side of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a>, and to draw up in the rear, and go on with their priming and loading; or, to make the division or platoon, after firing, to face to the right and left outwards from the centre, and one half rank to follow the other; and in that order to march in one centre file down on each side of the column into the rear, and there draw up as before.\n\nFiring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">Iron</a>, in Farriery, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> not unlike the blade of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>; which being made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> hot is applied to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>'s hams, or other places standing in need of it, as in preternatural swellings, farcy, knots, &c. in order to disperse them.","sp":267,"ep":267},{"h":"FIRKIN","t":"an English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of capacity for things liquid, being the fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a>: it contains eight gallons of ale, loap, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> herrings; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> gallons of beer.","sp":267,"ep":267},{"h":"FIRLOT","t":"a dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> used in Scotland.

Thus it is said of Christ (Col. i. 5.), that he is \"the first-born of every creature;\" and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">Revelation</a> (i. 5.) he is called \"the first-begotten of the dead;\" that is, according to the commentators, begotten of the Father before any creature was produced; and the first who rose from the dead by his own power. \"The first-born of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>,\" (Isa. xiv. 30.) signifies, The most miserable of all the poor; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOB\">Job</a> (xviii. 13.) \"The first-born of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>;\" that is, The most terrible of all deaths.\n\n**First <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">Fruits</a> (primitive),** among the Hebrews, were oblations of part of the fruits of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a>, offered to God as an acknowledgment of his sovereign dominion. The first of these fruits was offered in the name of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, being either two loaves of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, or a sheaf of barley which was threshed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of the temple. Every private person was obliged to bring his first fruits to the temple; and these consisted of wheat, barley, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a>, figs, apricots, olives, and dates.\n\nThere was another sort of first fruits which were paid to God. When bread was kneaded in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, a portion of it was set apart and given to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVITE\">Levite</a> who dwelt in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> there was no priest or Levite there, it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> into the oven, and consumed by the fire.

Some, however, are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that all fishes naturally inhabit the salt waters, and that they have mounted up into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> only by accident. A few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> only swim up into the rivers to deposit their spawn; but by far the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> keep in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and would soon expire in fresh water. There are about 400 species of fishes (according to Linn\u00e6us) of which we know something; but the unknown ones are supposed to be many more; and as they are thought to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in great depths of the sea remote from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, it is probable that many species <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> remain for ever unknown.\n\nFor the subdivisions, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, and natural history of this class of animals, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ICHTHYOLOGY\">Ichthyology</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>.\n\n**Blowing of Fish,** is a practice similar to that of blowing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a>, and pigs, and adopted for the same deceitful purposes. The method of blowing fish, especially cod and whitings, is by placing the end of a quill or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>-pipe at the vent, and pricking a hole with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIN\">fin</a> which is next the gill; thereby making the fish appear to the eye <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and full, which when dressed will be flabby, and little else than skin and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>. But this imposition may be discovered by placing the finger and thumb on each side of the vent, and squeezing it hard; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> may be perceived to go out, the skin will fall in, and the fish appear lank, and of little value.\n\n**Breeding of Fishes** may be turned to great advantage; for, besides furnishing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, obliging one's friends, and raising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, the land will be thereby greatly\ngreatly improved, so as to yield more this way than by any other employment whatever. See Fish Pond.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASTRATION\">Castration</a> of Fish, is a method first practised by Mr Tull, in order to prevent the excessive increase of fish in some of his ponds, where the numbers did not permit any of them to grow to an advantageous size. But he afterwards found, that the castrated fish grew much larger than their usual size, were more fat, and always in season. This operation may be performed both on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> fish; and the most eligible time for it is when the ovaries of the female have their ova in them, and when the vessels of the male, analogous to these, have their seminal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> in them; because, at this time, these vessels are more easily distinguished from the ureters, which convey the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> from the kidneys into the bladder, and are situated near the seminal vessels on each side of the spine; which, without sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, may be mistaken for the ovaries, especially when these last are empty. The time least proper for this operation, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> after they have spawned, because the fish are then too weak and languid to bear, with success, so severe an operation; however, with skill and care, it may be performed almost at any time. When a fish is to be castrated, it must be held in a wet cloth, with its belly upwards; then with a sharp penknife, having its point bent backwards, the operator cuts through the integuments of the rim of the belly, taking care not to wound any of the intestines. As soon as a small aperture is made, he carefully inserts a hooked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, and with this dilates the aperture from between the two fore-fins almost to the anus. He then, with two small blunt silver hooks, five or six inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, and of this form P, by the help of an assistant, holds open the belly of the fish; and with a spoon or spatula, removes carefully the intestines from one side. When these are removed, you see the ureter, a small vessel, nearly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the spine, and also the ovary, a larger vessel, lying before it, nearer the integuments of the belly. This last vessel is taken up with a hook of the same kind with those before mentioned, and, after detaching it from the side far enough for the purpose, divided transversely with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of sharp scissors, care being taken that the intestines are not wounded or injured. After one of the ovaries has been divided, the operator proceeds to divide the other in the same manner; and then the divided integuments of the belly are sewed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, the stitches being inserted at a small distance from one another. Mr Tull observes farther, that the spawning time is very various; that trouts are full about Christmas; perch in February; pikes in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARP\">carp</a> and tench in May; and that allowance must be made for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> and situation, with regard to the spawning of fish. When the fish are castrated, they are put into the water where they are intended to continue; and they take their chance in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> with other fish, as though they were not castrated. With tolerable care, few die of the operation. Phil. Trans. vol. xlviii. Part 2. Art. 106.\n\nAlthough we could not properly avoid inserting the above detail, it is presumed that few will be pleased with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>. The operation is peculiarly cruel, and the purpose of it only a detestable piece of Apician refinement.\n\nFeeding of Fishes. When they are fed in large pools or ponds, either malt boiled, or fresh grains, is the best food; thus carps may be raised and fed like capons, and tenches will feed as well. The care of feeding them is best committed to a gardener or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">butler</a>, who should be always at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. When fed in a stew, any sort of grain boiled, especially peas, and malt coarsely ground, are proper food; also the grains after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREWING\">brewing</a>, while fresh and sweet; but one bullock of malt not brewed will go as far as two of grains.\n\nStealing of Fish, by persons armed and disguised, is felony without benefit of clergy, by 9 Geo. I. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 22. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">Act</a>. And by 5 Geo. III. cap. 14, the penalty of transportation for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years is inflicted on persons stealing or taking fish in any water, within a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARK\">park</a>, paddock, orchard, or yard; and on the receivers, aiders, and abettors; and a forfeiture of five pounds to the owner of the fishery is made payable by persons taking or destroying (or attempting so to do) any fish in any river or other water within any enclosed ground, being private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>.\n\nPreserving of Fish for Cabinets. Linnaeus's method is, to expose them to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; and when they acquire such a degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a> that the skin loses its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> to the body of the fish, it may be slid off almost like a glove; the two sides of this skin may then be dried upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> like a plant, or one of the sides may be filled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a> of Paris to give the subject a due plumpness.\n\nA fish may be prepared, after it has acquired this degree of putrefaction, by making a longitudinal incision on the belly, and carefully dissecting the fleshy part from the skin, which is but slightly attached to it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the putrefaction. The skin is then to be filled with cotton and the antiseptic powder as directed for birds; and, lastly, to be sewed up where the incision was made.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">Gold</a> Fish. See Cyprinus, Ichthyology Index.\n\nGilding on Fish. In the posthumous papers of Mr Hooke, a method is described of gilding live craw fish, carps, &c., without injuring the fish. The cement for this purpose is prepared, by putting some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURGUNDY\">burgundy</a> pitch into a new earthen pot, and warming the vessel till it receives so much of the pitch as will stick round it; then strewing some finely powdered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a> before the pitch when growing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, adding a mixture of three pounds of linseed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> and one of oil of turpentine, covering the vessel, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> them for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> over a gentle fire, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> the mixture, as it is wanted, with so much pumice-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> in fine powder as will reduce it to the consistence of paint. The fish being wiped dry, the mixture is spread upon it; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLD_LEAF\">gold-<a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> being then laid on, and gently pressed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, the fish may be immediately put into water again, without any danger of the gold coming off, for the matter quickly grows firm in water.\n\nFish, in a ship, a plank or piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>, fastened to a ship's mast or yard, to strengthen it; which is done by nailing it on with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> spikes, and winding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a> hard about them.\n\nFishes, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HERALDRY\">Heraldry</a>, are the emblems of silence and watchfulness; and are borne either upright, inwound, extended, endorsed respecting each other, surmounting one another, fretted, &c.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLAZONING\">blazoning</a> fishes, those borne feeding, should be termed devouring; all fishes borne upright and having fins,\nFisher, fins, should be blazoned hauriant; and those borne transverse the escutcheon, must be termed naiant.\n\nFish Ponds, those made for the breeding or feeding of fish.\n\nFish ponds are no small improvement of watery and boggy lands, many of which are fit for no other use. In making of a pond, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> should be at the lowest part of the ground, that the trench of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>-gate or sluice, having a good fall, may not be too long in emptying. The best way of making the head secure, is to drive in two or three rows of stakes above six feet long, at above four feet distance from each other, the whole length of the pond head, whereof the first row should be rammed at least about four feet deep. If the bottom is false, the foundation may be laid with quicklime; which flaking, will make it as hard as a stone. Some lay a layer of lime, and another of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> dug out of the pond, among the piles and stakes; and when these are well covered, drive in others as they see occasion, ramming in the earth as before, till the pond head be of the height designed.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAM\">dam</a> should be made sloping on each side, leaving a waite to carry off the over abundance of water in times of floods or rains; and as to the depth of the pond, the deepest part need not exceed six feet, rising gradually in shoals towards the sides, for the fish to run themselves, and lay their spawn. Gravelly and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> bottoms, especially the latter, are best for breeding; and a fat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> fat water, as the washings of hills, commons, streets, finks, &c. is best for fattening all sorts of fish. For storing a pond, carp is to be preferred for its goodmels, quick growth, and great increase, as breeding five or six times a-year. A pond of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>, if it be a feeding and not breeding one, will every year feed 200 carps of three years old, 300 of two years old, and 400 of a year old. Carps delight in ponds that have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARL\">marl</a> or clay bottoms, with plenty of weeds and grass, whereon they feed in the hot months.\n\nPonds should be drained every three or four years, and the fish sorted. In breeding ones, the smaller ones are to be taken out, to store other ponds with; leaving a good stock of females, at least eight or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> years old, as they never breed before that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. In feeding ponds, it is best to keep them pretty near of a size.","sp":267,"ep":270},{"h":"FISHER","t":"JOHN, bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROCHESTER\">Rochester</a>, was born at Beverly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>, in the year 1459, and educated in the collegiate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>.

In the year following, he was appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a> Margaret's first divinity professor; and in 1504, consecrated bishop of Rochester; which small bishopric he would never resign, though he was offered both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELY\">Ely</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a>. It is generally allowed, that the foundation of the two colleges of Christ church and St John's, in Cambridge, was entirely owing to Bishop Fisher's persuasion and influence with the countess of Richmond: he not only formed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, but superintended the execution. On the promulgation of Martin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a>'s doctrine, our bishop was the first to enter the lists against him. On this occasion he exerted all his influence, and is generally supposed to have written the famous book by which Henry VIII. obtained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Defender of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">Faith</a>. Hitherto he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in favour with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>; but in 1527, opposing his divorce, and denying his supremacy, the implacable Harry determined, and finally effected, his destruction. In 1543, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> found him guilty of misprision of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a>, for concealing certain prophetic speeches of a fanatical impostor, called the Holy Maid of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a>, relative to the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; and condemned him, with five others, in lots of goods, and imprisonment during his majesty's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>; but he was released on paying 300l. for the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>.\n\nKing Henry being now married to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a> Boleyn, his obsequious parliament took an oath of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> proper for the occasion. This oath the bishop of Rochester steadily refused; alleging, that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> could not be convinced that the king's first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> was against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of God. For refusing this oath of succession, he was attainted by the parliament of 1534; and committed to the Tower, where he was cruelly treated, and were he would probably have died a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> death, had not the pope created him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">cardinal</a>. The king, now positively determined on his destruction, sent Rich, the solicitor general, under the pretence of consulting the bishop on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of conscience, but really with a design to draw him into a conversation concerning the supremacy. The honest old bishop spoke his mind without suspicion <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> reserve, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDICTMENT\">indictment</a> and conviction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> treason was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>. He was beheaded at Tower Hill, on the 22d of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1535, in the 77th year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. Thus died this good old prelate; who, notwithstanding his inflexible enmity to the Reformation, was undoubtedly a learned, pious, and honest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>. He wrote several treatises against Luther, and other works, which were printed at Wurtzburg, in 1597, in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> folio.","sp":270,"ep":270},{"h":"FISHERY","t":"Y denotes also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> of fish, more particularly the catching them for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>.\n\nWere we to enter into a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> and particular consideration of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a>, as at present established in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, this article would swell beyond its proper bounds; because, to do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to a subject of such concernment to the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, requires a very ample and distinct discussion. We shall, however, observe, that since the Divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a> hath so eminently stored the coasts of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> with the most valuable fish; and since fisheries, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> successful, become permanent nurseries for breeding expert fishermen; it is not only a duty we owe to the Supreme Being, not to despise the wonderful plenty he hath afforded us, by neglecting to extend this branch of commerce to the utmost; but it is a duty we owe to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> security, which depends upon the strength of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> nation can have a navy where there is not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> of benefits to breed and employ fishermen without any expense to the public, and no trade is so well calculated for training up these useful members of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> as fisheries.\n\nThe situation of the British coasts is the most advantageous in the world for catching fish: the Scottish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, particularly those to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> and west, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> most commodious for carrying on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> trade to perfection; for no country in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> can pretend to come up to Scotland in the abundance of the finest fish, with which its various creeks, bays, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, and coasts, are replenished. Of these advantages the Scots seem indeed to have been abundantly sensible; and their traffic in herrings, the most valuable of all the fisheries, is noticed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> so early as the ninth century. The frequent laws which were enacted in the reigns of James III., IV., and V., discover a steady determined zeal for the benefit of the native subjects, and the full restoration of the fisheries, which the Dutch had latterly found means to engross; and do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of those patriots whom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times affect to call barbarians.\n\nThe expedition of James V. to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBRIDES\">Hebrides</a> and western parts of the Highlands and his assiduity in exploring and founding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>, discovered a fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, to civilize the inhabitants, to promote the valuable fisheries at their doors, and to introduce general industry. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, at an early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, and the subsequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> and civil commotions in the kingdom, frustrated those wise designs, and the western fisheries remained in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> state of neglect. At length, 1602, James VI. returned the national purposes which had been thus chalked out by his grandfather. \"Three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> (says Dr Robertson) which might serve as a retreat for the industrious, and a nursery for arts and commerce, were appointed to be built in different parts of the Highlands; one in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAITHNESS\">Caithness</a>, another in Lochaber, and a third in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEWIS\">Lewis</a>; and in order to draw the inhabitants thither, all the privileges of the royal boroughs were to be conferred upon them. Finding it, however, to be no easy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> to inspire the inhabitants of those countries with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of industry, a resolution was taken to plant amongst them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> of people from the more industrious counties. The first experiment was made in the isle of Lewis; and as it was advantageously situated for the fishing trade (a source from which Scotland ought naturally to derive great wealth), the colony transported thither was drawn out of Fife, the inhabitants of which were well skilled in that branch of commerce. But before they had remained there <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> enough to manifest the good effects of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a>, the islanders, enraged at seeing their country occupied by those intruders, took arms, and surprising them in the night <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, murdered some of them, and compelled the rest to abandon the settlement. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> being soon turned to other objects, particularly to his succession to the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, we hear no more of this salutary project.\"\n\nThe Scottish fisheries were, however, resumed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I. who \"ordained an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> of the three kingdoms, for a general fishing within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a> seas and coasts of his majesty's said kingdoms; and for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the said association, ordained, that there should be a standing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> chosen and nominated by his majesty, and his successors from time to time.\" &c. &c. Several persons of distinction embarked in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, which the king honoured with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a>, and encouraged by his bounty. He also ordered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> to be more strictly observed; prohibited the importation of fish taken by foreigners; and agreed to purchase from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> his naval stores and the fish for his fleets. Thus the scheme of establishing a fishery in the Hebrides began to assume a favourable aspect; but all the hopes of the adventurers were frustrated by the breaking out of the civil wars, and the very tragic death of their benefactor.\n\nIn 1661, Charles II., the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Clarendon, and other persons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and fortune, resumed the business of the fisheries with greater vigour than any of their predecessors. For this purpose the most salutary laws were enacted by the parliaments of England and Scotland; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of which, all materials used in, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> depending upon, the fisheries, were exempted from all duties, excises, or imposts whatever. In England, the company were authorized to set up a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOTTERY\">lottery</a>, and to have a voluntary collection in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> churches; houses of entertainment, as taverns, inns, ale-houses, were to take one or more barrels of herrings, at the stated price of 30s. per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a>; and 2s. 6d. per barrel was to be paid to the stock of this company on all imported fish taken by foreigners. Some Dutch families were also invited, or permitted, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in Stormont: the herrings cured by the Royal English company gave general satisfaction, and, as mentioned above, brought a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> price for those days. Every circumstance attending this new establishment seemed to be the result of a judicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> and thorough knowledge of the\nbusiness, when the necessities of the king obliged him to withdraw his subscription or bounty; which gave such umbrage to the parties concerned, that they soon after dissolved.\n\nIn 1677, a new royal company was established in England, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of which was the duke of York, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DERBY\">Derby</a>, &c. Besides all the privileges which former companies had enjoyed, the king granted this new company a perpetuity, with power to purchase lands; and also \u00a320,000 to be paid them annually, out of the customs of the port of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, for every dogger or buss they should build and send out for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years to come. A stock of 15,980l. was immediately advanced, and afterwards 1600l. more. This small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> was soon exhausted in purchasing and fitting out busses, with other incidental expenses. The company, made, however, a successful beginning; and one of their busses or doggers actually took and brought home 32,000 cod fish; other vessels had also a favourable fishery. Such favourable beginnings might have excited fresh subscriptions, when an unforeseen event ruined the whole design beyond the possibility of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a>. Most of the busses had been built in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, and manned with Dutchmen; on which pretence the French, who were then at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with Holland, seized six out of seven vessels, with their cargoes and fishing tackle: and the company being now in debt, sold, in 1680, the remaining stores, &c. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of gentlemen and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> raised a new subscription of 60,000l. under the privileges and immunities of the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a>. This attempt also came to nothing, owing to the death of the king, and the troubles of the subsequent reign.\n\nSoon after the Revolution this business was again resumed, and upon a more extensive scale; the proposed capital being 300,000l., of which 100,000l. was to have been raised by the surviving patentees or their successors, and 200,000l. by new subscribers. Copies of the letters patent, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the company, and terms of subscription, were lodged at sundry places in London and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a>, for the perusal of the public, while the subscription was filling. It is probable, that King William's partiality to the Dutch fisheries, the succeeding war, or both of these circumstances, frustrated this new attempt; of which we have no farther account in the annals of that reign or since.\n\nThe Scottish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> had also, during the three last reigns, passed sundry acts for erecting companies and promoting the fisheries; but the intestine commotions of that country, and the great exertions which were made for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DARIEN\">Darien</a> establishment, enfeebled all other attempts, whether collectively or by individuals, within that kingdom.\n\nIn 1749, his late majesty having, at the opening of the parliament, warmly recommended the improvement of the fisheries, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of commons appointed a committee to inquire into the state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERRING\">herring</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> fisheries, and to consider of the most probable means of extending the same. All ranks of men were elevated with an idea of the boundless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> that would flow into the kingdom from this source. A subscription of 500,000l. was immediately filled in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, by a body of men who were incorporated for 21 years by the name of The Society of the Free British Fishery. Every encouragement was held out by government, both to the society, and to individuals who might embark in this national business. A bounty of 30s. per ton was to be paid annually out of the customs, for 14 years, to the owners of all decked vessels or busses, from 20 to 80 tons burden, which should be built after the commencement of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of, and fitted out and employed in, the said fisheries, whether by the Society or any other persons. At the same time numerous pamphlets and newspaper essays came forth; all pretending to elucidate the subject, and to convince the public with what facility the herring fisheries might be transferred from Dutch to British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>. This proved, however, a more arduous task than had been foreseen by superficial speculators. The Dutch were frugal in their expenditures and living; perfect masters of the arts of fishing and curing, which they had carried to the greatest height and perfection. They were in full possession of the European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a>; and their fish, whether delivered or otherwise, had the reputation of superior qualities to all others taken in our seas. With such advantages, the Dutch not only maintained their ground against this formidable company, but had also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of seeing the capital gradually sinking, without having procured an adequate return to the adventurers; notwithstanding various aids and efforts of government from time to time in their favour, particularly in 1757, when an advance of 20s. per ton was added to the bounty.\n\nIn 1780 the public attention was again called to the state of the British fisheries, by the suggestions of Mr Dempster in the house of commons, and by different publications that appeared upon the subject; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which the minister suffered a committee to be named; to inquire into this great source of national wealth. To that committee it appeared, that the best way of improving the fisheries was to encourage the inhabitants living nearest to the seat of them to become fishers: And it being found that the north-western <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of the kingdom, though abounding with fish and with fine harbours, was utterly destitute of towns, an act was passed for incorporating certain persons therein named, by the style of \"The British Society for extending the fisheries and improving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> coasts of the kingdom;\" and to enable them to subscribe a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> stock, and therewith to purchase lands, and build thereon free towns, villages, and fishing stations, in the Highlands and islands in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Great Britain called Scotland, and for other purposes. The isle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULL\">Mull</a>, Loch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROOM\">Broom</a>, the isles of Sky and of Cannay, have already been pitched upon as proper situations for some of these towns. The progress of such an undertaking from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> must be slow, but still slower when carried on with a limited capital arising from the subscriptions of a few public-spirited individuals. But it is not to be doubted but that it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> ultimately tend to the increase of our fisheries, and to the improvement of the Highland part of this kingdom. Its tendency is also to lessen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMIGRATION\">emigration</a> of a brave and industrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of inhabitants, too many of whom have already removed with their families to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>.\n\nI. Anchovy Fishery. The anchovy is caught in the months of May, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>, on the coasts of Catalonia, Provence, &c., at which season it constantly repairs up the straits of Gibraltar, into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>.\nCollins says they are also found in plenty on the western coasts of England and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>.\n\nThe fishing for them is chiefly in the night time; when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> being put on the stern of their little fishing vessels, the anchovies flock round, and are caught in the nets. But then it is asserted to have been found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, that anchovies taken thus by fire, are neither so good, so firm, nor so proper for keeping, as those which are taken without fire.\n\nWhen the fishery is over, they cut off the heads, take out their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALL\">gall</a> and guts, and then lay them in barrels, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> them. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> way of eating anchovies is with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a>, &c. in order to which they are first boned, and the tails, fins, &c. slipped off.\u2014Being put on the fire, they dissolve almost in any liquor. Or they are made into a sauce by mincing them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, &c. Some also pickle anchovies in small delft or earthen pots, made on purpose, of two or three pounds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, more or less, which they cover with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a> to keep them the better. Anchovies should be chosen small, fresh pickled, white on the outside and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> within. They must have a round back; for those which are flat or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> are often nothing but sardines. Besides these qualities, the pickle, on opening the pots or barrels, must be of a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, and not have lost its flavour.\n\n2. Cod Fishery. There are two kinds of cod fish; the one green or white cod, and the other dried or cured cod; though it is all the same fish, differently prepared; the former being sometimes salted and barrelled, then taken out for use; and the latter, having lain some competent time in salt, dried in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>. We shall therefore speak of each of these apart; and first of the\n\nGreen. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> fisheries for green cod are in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANADA\">Canada</a>, on the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of Newfoundland, and on the isle of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>, and the isle of Sable; to which places vessels <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> parts both of Europe and America. They are from 100 to 150 tons burden, and will catch between 30,000 and 40,000 cod each. The most essential part of the fishery is, to have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> who knows how to cut up the cod, one who is skilled to take off the head properly, and above all a good falter, on which the preserving of them, and consequently the success of the voyage depends. The best season is from the beginning of February to the end of April; the fish, which in the winter retire to the deepest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, coming then on the banks, and fattening extremely. What is caught from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> to June keeps well; but those taken in July, August, and September, when it is warm on the banks, are apt to spoil soon. Every fisher takes but one at a time: the most expert will take from 350 to 400 in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; but that is the most, the weight of the fish and the great coldness on the bank fatiguing very much. As soon as the cod are caught, the head is taken off; they are opened, gutted, and salted; and the falter flows them in the bottom of the hold, head to tail, in beds a fathom or two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>; laying layers of salt and fish alternately, but never mixing fish caught on different days. When they have lain thus three or four days to drain off the water, they are replaced in another part of the ship, and salted again; where they remain till the vessel is loaded. Sometimes they are cut in thick pieces, and put in barrels for the convenience of carriage.\n\nDry. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> fishery for this article is, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> Rose to the Bay des Exports, along the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACENTIA\">Placentia</a>, in which compass there are divers commodious ports for the fish to be dried in. These, though of the same kind with the fresh cod, are much smaller, and therefore fitter to keep, as the salt penetrates more easily into them. The fishery of both is much alike; only this latter is most expensive, as it takes up more time and employs more hands, and yet scarce half so much salt is spent in this as in the other. The bait is herrings, of which great quantities are taken on the coast of Placentia. When several vessels meet and intend to fish in the same part, he whose flotilla first touches ground becomes entitled to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> and privileges of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a>: he has the choice of his station, and the refusal of all the wood on the coast at his arrival. As fast as the masters arrive, they unrig all their vessels, leaving nothing but the throats to sustain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASTS\">masts</a>; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time the mates provide a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENT\">tent</a> on shore, covered with branches of trees, and falls over them, with a scaffold of great trunks of pines, 12, 15, 16, and often 20 feet high, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> from 40 to 60 feet long, and about one-third as much in breadth. While the scaffold is preparing, the crew are a-fishing; and as fast as they catch, they bring their fish ashore, and open and salt them upon moveable benches; but the main salting is performed on the scaffold. When the fish have taken salt, they wash and hang them to drain on rails; when drained, they are laid on kinds of flages, which are small pieces of wood laid across, and covered with branches of trees, having the leaves stripped off for the passage of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. On these flages, they are disposed, a fish thick, head against tail, with the back uppermost, and are turned carefully four times every 24 hours. When they begin to dry, they are laid in heaps 10 or 12 thick, in order to retain their warmth; and every day the heaps are enlarged till they become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> their first bulk; then two heaps are joined together, which they turn every day as before: lastly, they are salted again, beginning with those first salted; and being laid in huge piles, they remain in that situation till they are carried on board the ships, where they are laid on the branches of trees disposed for that purpose, upon the ballast, and round the ship, with mats to prevent their contracting any moisture.\n\nThere are four sorts of commodities drawn from cod, viz. the founds, the tongues, the roes, and the oil extracted from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a>. The first is salted at the fishery together with the fish, and put in barrels from 600 to 700 pounds. The tongues are done in like manner, and brought in barrels from 400 to 500 pounds. The roes are also salted in barrels, and serve to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> into the sea to draw fish together, and particularly pilchards. The oil comes in barrels, from 400 to 520 pounds, and is used in dressing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>. In Scotland, they catch a small kind of cod on the coasts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUCHAN\">Buchan</a>, and all along the Murray frith on both sides; as also in the friths of Forth, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLYDE\">Clyde</a>, &c. which is much esteemed. They salt and dry them in the sun upon rocks, and sometimes in the chimney.\n\n3. Coral Fishery. See Coral.\n\n4. Herring\n4. Herring Fishery. Our great stations for this fishery are off the Shetland and Western Isles, and off the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORFOLK\">Norfolk</a>, in which the Dutch also share. There are two seasons for fishing herring; the first from June to the end of August; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> in autumn, when the fogs become very favourable for this kind of fishing. The Dutch begin their herring fishing on the 24th of June, and employ a vast number of vessels therein, called buffles, being between 45 and 60 tons burden each, and carrying three or four small cannon. They never sail out of port, without a convoy, unless there be enough together to make about 18 or 20 cannon among them, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> they are allowed to go in company. Before they go out they make a verbal agreement, which has the same force as if it were in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>. The regulations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRALTY\">admiralty</a> of Holland are partly followed by the French and other nations, and partly improved and augmented with new ones; as, that no fisher shall cast his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> within 100 fathoms of another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>; that while the nets are cast, a light shall be kept on the hind part of the vessel; that when a boat is by any accident obliged to leave off fishing, the light shall be cast into the sea; that when the greater part of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> leaves off fishing, and casts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCHOR\">anchor</a>, the rest shall do the same, &c.\n\nMr Anderson gives to the Scots a knowledge of great antiquity in the herring fishery. He says that the Netherlanders resorted to these coasts as early as A.D. 836, to purchase salted fish of the natives, but, imposing on the strangers, they learned the art, and took up the trade, in after-times of such immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a> to the Dutch.\n\nSir Walter Raleigh's observations on that head, extracted from the same author, are extremely worthy the attention of the curious, and excite reflections on the vast strength resulting from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> of well-applied industry.\n\nIn 1603, he remarks, the Dutch sold to different nations as many herrings as amounted to \u00a31,759,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>. In the year 1615, they at once sent out 2000 buffles, and employed in them 37,000 fishermen. In the year 1618, they sent out 3000 ships, with 50,000 men to take the herrings, and 9000 more ships to transport and sell the fish; which by sea and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> employed 150,000 men, besides those first mentioned. All this wealth was gotten on our coasts, while our attention was taken up in a distant whale fishery.\n\nThe Scottish monarchs for a long time seemed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> all their attention to the preservation of the salmon fishery, probably because their subjects were such novices in sea affairs. At length James III. endeavoured to stimulate his great men to these patriotic undertakings; for by an act of his third parliament, he compelled \"certain lords spiritual and temporal, and burrows, to make ships, buffles, and boats, with nets and other pertinents, for fishing.\" That the same should be made in each burgh; in number according to the substance of each burgh, and the least of them to be of twenty tons: and that all idle men be compelled by the sheriffs in the country to go on board the same.\"\n\nNumerous indeed have been the attempts made at different periods to secure this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> to ourselves, but without success. In the late reign, a very strong effort was made, and bounties allowed for the encouragement of British adventurers: the first was of 30s. per ton to every baffle of 70 tons and upwards. This bounty was afterwards raised to 50s. per ton, to be paid to such adventurers as were entitled to it by claiming it at the places of rendezvous. The buffles are from 20 to 90 tons burden, but the best size is 80. A vessel of 80 tons ought to take ten lasts, or 120 barrels of herrings, to clear expenses, the price of the fish to be admitted to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUINEA\">guinea</a> a barrel. A ship of this size ought to have 18 men, and three boats: one of 20 tons should have six men; and every five tons above require an additional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. To every ton are 280 yards of nets; so a vessel of 80 tons carries 20,000 square yards: each net is 12 yards long, and 10 deep, and every boat takes out from 20 to 30 nets, and puts them together, so as to form a long train; they are sunk at each end of the train by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, which weighs it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>: the top is supported by buoys, made of sheepskin, with a hollow stick at the mouth fastened tight: through this the skin is blown up, and then stopped with a peg, to prevent the escape of the air. Sometimes these buoys are placed at the top of the nets: at other times the nets are suffered to sink deeper, by the lengthening the cords fastened to them, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> being for that purpose 10 or 12 fathoms long. But the best fisheries are generally in more shallow water.\n\nOf the Scots fishery in the Western Isles, the following account is given by Mr Pennant. \"The fishing is always performed in the night, unless by accident. The buffles remain at anchor, and send out their boats a little before sunset; which continue out, in winter and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, till day light; often taking up and emptying their nets, which they do 10 or 12 times in a night, in case of good success. During winter it is a most dangerous and fatiguing employ, by reason of the greatness and frequency of the gales in these seas, and in such gales are the most successful captures: but by the Providence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, the fishers are seldom lost; and, what is wonderful, few are visited with illness. They go out well prepared, with a warm great coat, boots, and skin aprons, and a good provision of beef and spirits. The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> attends the buffles, which in the tempestuous season, and in the darkest nights, are continually shifting, in these narrow seas, from harbour to harbour. Sometimes 80 barrels of herrings are taken in a night by the boats of a single vessel. It once happened, in Loch Slappan, in Sky, that a baffle of 80 tons might have taken 200 barrels in one night, with 10,000 square yards of net; but the matter was obliged to desist, for want of a sufficient number of hands to preserve the capture. The herrings are preserved by salting; after the entrails are taken out. This last is an operation performed by the country people, who get three halfpence per barrel for their trouble; and sometimes, even in the winter, can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> fifteen pence a-day. This employs both women and children; but the salting is only intrusted to the crew of the buffles. The fish are laid on their backs in the barrels, and layers of salt between them. The entrails are not lost, for they are boiled into an oil: 8000 fish will yield ten gallons, valued at one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a> the gallon. A vessel of 80 tons takes out 144 barrels of salt; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWBACK\">drawback</a> of 2s. 8d. is allowed for each barrel used by the foreign or Irish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a> of the fish; but there is a duty of 1s. per barrel for the home consumption, and the same...\"\nfor those sent to Ireland. The barrels are made of oak\nslaves chiefly from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a>; the hoops from several\nparts of our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, and are either of oak, birch,\nhazel or willow; the last from Holland, liable to a du-\nty. The barrels cost about 3s. each, they hold from\n500 to 800 fish, according to the size of the fish; and\nare made to contain 32 gallons. The barrels are in-\nspected by proper officers; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COOPER\">cooper</a> examines if they\nare statutable and good; if faulty, he destroys them,\nand obliges the maker to stand to the loss.\n\n\"Loch Broom has been celebrated for three or four\ncenturies as the resort of herrings. They generally\nappear here in July; those that turn into this bay are\npart of the brigade that detaches itself from the west-\nern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of that great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> which annually defers\nthe vast depths of the arctic circle, and comes, heaven-\ndirected, to the seats of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>, offered as a cheap\nfood to millions, whom wasteful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>-hearted\navarice hath deprived, by enhancing the price, of the\nwonted supports of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIGRATION\">migration</a> of these\nfish from their northern retreat is regular; their visits\nto the Western isles and coasts certain; but their at-\ntachment to one particular loch extremely precarious.\nAll have their turns: that which swarmed with\nfish one year, is totally deserted the following; yet\nthe next loch to it may be crowded with the shoals.\nThese changes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> give often full employ to\nthe buffes, who are continually shifting their harbour\nin quest of news respecting these important wanderers.\nThey commonly appear here in July; the latter end\nof August they go into deep water, and continue\nthere for some time, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> cause:\nin November, they return to the shallows, when a new\nfishery commences, which continues till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a>: at\nthat time the herrings become full of roe, and are use-\nful as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of commerce. Some doubt, whether\nthese herrings that appear in November are not part\nof a new migration; for they are as fat, and make\nthe same appearance, as those that composed the first.\nThe signs of the arrival of the herrings are flocks of\ngulls, who catch up the fish while they skim on the\nsurface, and of gannets, who plunge and bring them\nup from considerable depths. Both these birds are\nclosely attended to by the fishers. Cod fish, haddock,\nand dog fish, follow the herrings in vast multitudes:\nthese voracious fish keep on the outsides of the col-\numns, and may be a concurrent reason of driving the\nshoals into bays and creeks. In summer, they come\ninto the bays generally with the warmest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>,\nand with easy gales. During winter, the hard gales\nfrom north-west are supposed to assist in forcing them\ninto shelter. East winds are very unfavourable to the\nfishery.\"\n\nHerrings are cured either white or pickled, or red.\n\nOf the fish, those done by the Dutch are the\nmost esteemed, being distinguished into four sorts, ac-\ncording to their sizes; and the best are those that are\nfat, flethy, firm, and white, salted the same day they\nare taken, with good salt, and well barrelled. The\nBritish cured herrings are little inferior, if not equal,\nto the Dutch: for in spite of all their endeavours to\nconceal the secret, their method of curing, lasting, or\ncalking the herrings, has been discovered, and is as\nfollows. After they have hauled in their nets, which\nthey drag in the stern of their vessels backwards\nforwards in traversing the coast, they throw them upon\nthe ship's deck, which is cleared of every thing for\nthat purpose: the crew is separated into sundry divi-\nsions, and each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> has a peculiar task; one part\nopens and guts the herrings, leaving the milt and\nroes; another cures and salts them, by lining or rub-\nbing their inside with salt; the next packs them, and\nbetween each row and division they sprinkle handfuls\nof salt; lastly, the cooper puts the finishing hand to all,\nby heading the casks very tight, and flowing them in the\nhold.\n\nRed herrings must lie 24 hours in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRINE\">brine</a>, in-\nasmuch as they are to take all their salt there; and\nwhen they are taken out, they are spitted, that is,\nstrung by the head on little wooden spits, and then\nhung in a chimney made for that purpose. After\nwhich, a fire of brushwood, which yields a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of\nsmoke, but no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>, being made under them, they\nremain there till sufficiently smoked and dried, and are\nafterwards barrelled up for keeping.\n\n5. Lobster Fishery. Lobsters are taken along the\nBritish channel, and on the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a>, whence\nthey are brought to London for sale; and also in the\nfirth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, and on the coast of Northumber-\nland. By 10 and 11 W. III. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 24, no lobster is to\nbe taken under eight inches in length, from the peak\nof the nose to the end of the middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIN\">fin</a> of the tail;\nand by 9 G. II. cap. 33, no lobsters are to be taken\non the coast of Scotland from the 1st of June to the\n1st of September.\n\n6. Mackerel Fishery. The mackerel is a summer fish\nof passage, found in large shoals, in divers parts of the\nocean, not far north; but especially on the French\nand English coasts. The fishing is usually in the\nmonths of April, May, and June, and even July, ac-\ncording to the place. They enter the English chan-\nnel in April, and proceed up to the straits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a>\nas the summer advances; so that by June they are on\nthe coasts of Cornwall, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUSSEX\">Sussex</a>, Normandy, Picardy,\n&c. where the fishery is most considerable. They are\nan excellent food fresh; and not to be despised, when\nwell prepared, pickled, and put up in barrels; a me-\nthod of preserving them chiefly used in Cornwall.\n\nThe fish is taken two ways; either with a line or\nnets: the latter is the more considerable, and is usually\nperformed in the night-time. The rules observed in\nthe fishing for mackerel are much the same as those\nalready mentioned in the fishery of herrings.\n\nThere are two ways of pickling them: the first is,\nby opening and gutting them, and filling the belly\nwith salt, crammed in as hard as possible with a stick;\nwhich done, they range them in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> or rows, at the\nbottom of the vessel, interweaving salt between the layers.\nIn the second way, they put them immediately into\ntubs full of brine, made of fresh water and salt; and\nleave them to steep, till they have imbibed salt enough\nto make them keep; after which, they are taken\nout, and barrelled up, taking care to press them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>\ndown.\n\nMackerel are not cured or exported as merchandise,\nexcept a few by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YARMOUTH\">Yarmouth</a> and Leoftoff merchants,\nbut are generally consumed at home; especially in\nthe city of London, and the sea-ports between the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a> and Yarmouth, east, and the Land's End of\nCornwall, west.\n7. Oyster Fishery. This fishery is principally carried on at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLCHESTER\">Colchester</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSEX\">Essex</a>; Feverham and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a>; the Isle of Wight; the Swales of the Medway; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TENBY\">Tenby</a> on the coast of Wales. From Feverham, and adjacent parts, the Dutch have sometimes loaded a hundred large hoyes with oysters in a year. They are also taken in great quantities near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTSMOUTH\">Portsmouth</a>, and in all the creeks and rivers between Southampton and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHICHESTER\">Chichester</a>: many of which are carried about by sea to London and to Colchester, to be fed in the pits about Wavenhoe and other places.\n\n8. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEARL\">Pearl</a> Fishery. See Pearl, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol6.html#article-CONCHOLOGY\">Conchology</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>, and Ceylon.\n\n9. Pilchard Fishery. The chief pilchard fisheries are along the coasts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DALMATIA\">Dalmatia</a>, on the coast of Bretagne, and along the coasts of Cornwall and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVONSHIRE\">Devonshire</a>. That of Dalmatia is very plentiful: that on the coasts of Bretagne employs annually about 300 ships. Of the pilchard fishery on the coast of Cornwall the following account is given by Dr Borlase: \"It employs a great number of men on the sea, training them thereby to naval affairs; employs men, women, and children, on land, in salting, pressing, washing and cleaning; in making boats, nets, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a>, casks, and all the trades depending on their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> and sale. The poor are fed with the offals of the captures, the land with the refuse of the fish and salt; the merchant finds the gains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> and honest commerce, the fisherman the gains of the fish. Ships are often freighted hither with salt, and into foreign countries with the fish, carrying off at the same time part of our tin. Of the usual produce of the great number of hogheads exported each year for ten years from 1747 to 1756 inclusive, from the four ports of Fowey, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALMOUTH\">Falmouth</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENZANCE\">Penzance</a>, and St Ives, it appears that Fowey has exported yearly 1732 hogheads; Falmouth, 14,631 hogheads and two thirds; Penzance and Mounts-Bay 12,149 hogheads and one third; St Ives, 1280 hogheads: in all amounting to 29,795 hogheads. Every hoghead for ten years last past, together with the bounty allowed for each hoghead exported, and the oil made out of each hoghead, has amounted, one year with another at an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a>, to the price of 1l. 13s. 3d.; so that the cash paid for pilchards exported has, at a medium, annually amounted to the sum of 49,532l. 10s.\"\u2014The numbers that are taken at one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> out of the nets are amazingly great. Mr Pennant says, that Dr Borlase assured him, that on the 5th of October 1767, there were at one time enclosed in St Ives's Bay 7000 hogheads, each hoghead containing 35,000 fish, in all 245 millions.\n\nThe pilchards naturally follow the light, which contributes much to the facility of the fishery; the season is from June to September. On the coasts of France they make use of the roes of the cod fish as a bait; which, thrown into the sea, makes them rise from the bottom, and run into the nets. On our coasts there are persons posted ashore, who, spying by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of the water where the shoals are, make signs to the boats to go among them to cast their nets. When taken, they are brought on shore to a warehouse, where they are laid up in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> piles, supported with backs and sides; and as they are piled, they salt them with bay salt; in which lying to soak for 30 or 40 days, they run out a deal of blood, with dirty pickle and bitters; then they wash them clean in sea water; and, when dry, barrel and press them hard down to squeeze out the oil, which issues out at a hole in the bottom of the casks.\n\n10. Salmon Fishery. The chief salmon fisheries in Europe are in England, Scotland, and Ireland, in the rivers, and sea coasts adjoining to the river mouths. The most distinguished for salmon in Scotland are, the river Tweed, the Clyde, the Tay, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEE\">Dee</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DON\">Don</a>, the Spey, the Ness, the Bewly, &c. in most of which it is very common, about the height of summer, especially if the weather happens to be very hot, to catch four or five score salmon at a draught. The chief rivers in England for salmon are, the Tyne, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENT\">Trent</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVERN\">Severn</a>, and the Thames. The fishing is performed with nets, and sometimes with a kind of locks or weirs made on purpose, which in certain places have iron or wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATES\">grates</a> disposed, in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>, that being impelled by any force in a contrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> to the course of the river, they may give way and open a little at the point of contact, and immediately shut again, closing the angle. The salmon, therefore, coming up into the rivers, are admitted into these grates, which open, and suffer them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through, but shut again, and prevent their return. The salmon is also caught with a spear, which they dart into him when they see him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a> near the surface of the water. It is customary likewise to catch them with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> and lanthorn, or wisp of straw set on fire; for the fish naturally following the light, are struck with the spear, or taken in a net spread for that purpose, and lifted with a sudden jerk from the bottom.\n\n\"The capture of salmon in the Tweed, about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of July (says Mr Pennant) is prodigious. In a good fishery, often a boat load, and sometimes near two, are taken in a tide: some few years ago there were above 700 fish taken at one haul, but from 50 to 100 is very frequent. The cooperers in Berwick then begin to talt both salmon and grilles in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> and other large vessels, and afterwards barrel them to send abroad, having then far more than the London markets can take off their hands.\n\n\"Most of the salmon taken before April, or to the setting in of the warm weather, is sent fresh to London in balkets: unless now and then the vessel is disappointed by contrary winds of failing immediately; in which case the fish is brought ashore again to the cooper's offices, and boiled, pickled, and kitted, and sent to the London markets by the same ship, and fresh salmon put in the balkets in lieu of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STALE\">stale</a> ones. At the beginning of the season, when a ship is on the point of failing, a fresh clean salmon will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> from a shilling to eighteen pence a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>; and most of the time that this part of the trade is carried on, the prices are from five to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> shillings per stone; the value rising and falling according to the plenty of fish, or the prospect of a fair or foul <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>. Some fish are sent in this manner to London the latter end of September, when the weather grows cool; but then the fish are full of large roes, grow very thin bellied, and are not esteemed either palatable or wholesome.\n\n\"The season for fishing in the Tweed begins November 3rd, but the fishermen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> very little till after Christmas: it ends on Michaelmas day; yet the corporation of Berwick (who are conservators of the river)\nThere are on the river 41 considerable fisheries, extending upwards about 14 miles from the mouth, (the others above being of no great value), which are rented for near \u00a3500l. per annum; the expense attending the servants <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a>, nets, boats, &c. amount to \u00a3500l. more; which together makes up the sum \u00a310,500l. Now, in consequence, the produce must defray all, and no less than 20 times that sum of fish will effect it; so that 208,000 salmon must be caught there one year with another.\n\nScotland possesses great numbers of fine fisheries on both sides of that kingdom. The Scotch in early times had most severe laws against the killing of this fish; for the third offence was made capital, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of James IV. Before that, the offender had power to redeem his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. They were thought in the time of Henry VI. a present worthy of a crowned head; for in that reign the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> of Scotland sent to the duchess of Clarence 10 casks of salted salmon; which Henry directed to pass duty free. The salmon are cured in the same manner as at Berwick, and a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> is sent to London in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>; but after that time, the adventurers begin to barrel and export them to foreign countries; but we believe that commerce is far less lucrative than it was in former times, partly owing to the great increase of the Newfoundland fishery, and partly to the general relaxation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a> in the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>.\n\nIreland (particularly the north) abounds with this fish; the most considerable fishery is at Cranna, on the river Ban, about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> and a half from Coleraine. When I made the tour of that hospitable kingdom in 1754, it was rented by a neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> for \u00a360l. a-year; who assured me, that the tenant, his predecessor, gave \u00a3600l. per annum, and was a much greater gainer by the bargain, for the reasons before mentioned, and on account of the number of the poachers who destroy the fish in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FENCE\">fence</a> months.\n\nThe mouth of this river faces the north; and is finely situated to receive the fish that roam along the coast in search of an inlet into some fresh water, as they do all along that end of the kingdom which opposes itself to the northern ocean. We have seen near Ballincastle, nets placed in the sea at the foot of the promontories that jut into it, which the salmon strike into as they are wandering close to shore; and numbers are taken by that method.\n\nIn the Ban they fish with nets 18 score yards long, and are continually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> night and day the whole season, which we think lasts about four months, two sets of 16 men each alternately relieving one another. The best drawing is when the tide is coming in: we were told, that at a single draught there were once 840 fish taken.\n\nA few miles higher up the river is a wear where a considerable number of fish that escape the nets are taken. We were lately informed, that, in the year 1760, about 320 tons were taken in the Cranna fishery.\n\nCuring Salmon. When the salmon are taken, they open them along the back, take out the guts and gills, and cut out the greatest part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>, endeavouring to make the inside as smooth as possible: they then salt the fish in large tubs for the purpose, where they lie a considerable time soaking in brine; and about October, they are packed close up in barrels, and sent to London, or exported up the Mediterranean. They have also in Scotland a great deal of salmon salted in the common way, which after soaking in brine a competent time, is well pressed, and then dried in smoke: this is called kipper, and is chiefly made for home consumption; and if properly cured and prepared, is reckoned very delicious.\n\nSturgeon Fishery. The greatest sturgeon fishery is in the mouth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOLGA\">Volga</a>, on the Caspian sea; where the Muscovites employ a great number of hands, and catch them in a kind of enclosure, formed by huge stakes representing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> Z repeated several times. These fisheries are open on the side next the sea, and close on the other; by which means the fish ascending in its course up the river, is embarrassed in these narrow angular retreats, and is easily killed with a harping iron. Sturgeons, when fresh, eat deliciously; and in order to make them keep, they are salted or pickled in large pieces, and put up in casks from 30 to 50 pounds. But the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of this fishery is the roe, of which the Muscovites are extremely fond, and of which is made the caviar, or kavia, so much esteemed by the Italians.\n\nTunny Fishery. The tunny (a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of Scomber), was a fish well known to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, and made a great article of commerce: And there are still very considerable tunny fisheries on the coasts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, as well as several other parts of the Mediterranean.\n\nThe nets are spread over a large space of sea by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CABLES\">cables</a> fastened to anchors, and are divided into several compartments. The entrance is always directed, according to the season, towards that part of the sea from which the fish are known to come. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> placed upon the summit of a rock high above the water, gives a signal of the fish being arrived; for he can discern from that elevation what passes under the waters infinitely better than any person nearer the surface. As soon as notice is given that the shoal of fish has penetrated as far as the inner compartment, or the chamber of death, the netting is drawn close, and the slaughter begins.\n\nThe undertakers of these fisheries pay an acknowledgment to the king, or the lord upon whose land they fix the main stay or foot of the tonnare; they make the best bargain they can: and, till success has crowned their endeavours, obtain this leave for a small consideration; but the rent is afterwards raised in proportion to their capture.\n\nThe tunny enters the Mediterranean about the vernal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUINOX\">equinox</a>, travelling in a triangular phalanx, so as to cut the waters with its point, and to present an extensive base for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> and currents to act against, and impel forwards. These fish repair to the warm seas of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> to spawn, steering their course thither along the European shores, but as they return, approach the African coast; the young fry is placed in the van of the squadron as they travel. They come back from the east in May, and abound on the coast of Sicily and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALABRIA\">Calabria</a> about that time. In autumn they steer northward, and frequent the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMALFI\">Amalfi</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>; but during the whole season stragglers are occasionally caught.\nWhen taken in May, the usual time of their appearance in the Calabrian bays, they are full of spawn, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> is then esteemed unwholesome, apt to occasion headaches and vapours; the milts and roes are particularly so at that season. To prevent these bad effects, the natives fry them in oil, and afterwards salt them. The quantity of this fish consumed annually in the Two Sicilies almost exceeds the bounds of calculation. From the beginning of May to the end of October it is eaten fresh, and all the rest of the year it is in use salted. The most delicate part is the muzzle. The belly salted was called tarantallum, and accounted a great delicacy by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>; its present name is Surra. The rest of the body is cut into slices, and put into tubs.\n\nTurbot Fishery. Turbots grow to a large size, some of them weighing from 23 to 30 pounds. They are taken chiefly off the north coast of England, and others off the Dutch coast. The large turbot (as well as several other kinds of flat fish) are taken by the hook and line, for they lie in deep water; the method of taking them in weirs or flaked nets being very precarious. When the fishermen go out to fish, each person is provided with three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, which are coiled on a flat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> piece of wicker work; the hooks being baited, and placed regularly in the centre of the coil. Each line is furnished with 14 score of hooks, at the distance of six feet two inches from each other. The hooks are fastened to the lines upon heads of twisted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> 27 inches in length. When fishing, there are always three men in each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COBLE\">coble</a>, and consequently nine of these lines are fastened together, and used in one line, extending in length near three miles, and furnished with 2520 hooks. An anchor and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUOY\">buoy</a> are fixed at the first end of the line, and one more of each at the end of each man's lines; in all four anchors, which are common perforated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, and four buoys made of leather or cork. The line is always laid across the current. The tides of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a> and ebb continue an equal time upon our coast, and, when undisturbed by winds, run each way about six hours; they are so rapid that the fishermen can only throw and haul their lines at the turn of tide, and therefore the lines always remain upon the ground about six hours; during which time the myxine glutinosa of Linnaeus will frequently penetrate the fish that are on the hooks, and entirely devour them, leaving only the skin and bones. The same rapidity of tides prevents their using hand lines; and therefore two of the people commonly wrap themselves in the sail, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> while the other keeps a strict look-out, for fear of being run down by ships, and to observe the weather. For storms often rise so suddenly, that it is with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> difficulty they can sometimes escape to the shore, leaving their lines behind.\n\nBesides the coble, the fishermen have also a five men boat, which is 40 feet long and 15 broad, and 25 tons burden; it is so called, though navigated by five men and a boy, because one of the men is commonly hired to cook, &c., and does not share in the profits with the other five. This boat is decked at each end, but open in the middle, and has two large lug sails. All our able fishermen go in these boats to the herring fishery at Yarmouth in the latter end of September, and return about the middle of November. The boats are then laid up till the beginning of Lent, at which time they go off in them to the edge of the Dogger, and other places, to fish for turbot, cod, ling, skates, &c. They always take two cobs on board; and when they come upon their ground, anchor the boat, throw out the cobs, and fish in the same manner as those who go from the shore in a coble; with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> only, that here each man is provided with double the quantity of lines, and instead of waiting the return of the tide in the coble, return to their boat and bait their other lines; thus hauling one net and shooting another every turn of tide. They commonly run into harbour twice a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> to deliver their fish.\n\nThe best bait is fresh herring cut in pieces of a proper size; the five men boats are always furnished with nets for taking them. Next to herrings are the lesser lampreys. The next baits in esteem are small haddock cut in pieces, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>, and limpets, here called fiddlers; and when none of these can be had, they use bullock's liver. The hooks are two inches and a half long in the shank, and near an inch wide between the shank and the point. The line is made of small cording, and is always tanned before it is used.\n\nTurbots are extremely delicate in their choice of baits; for if a piece of herring or haddock has been 12 hours out of the sea, and then used as bait, they will not touch it.\n\nWhale Fishery. See Bal\u00e6na, Cetology Index.\n\nWhales are chiefly caught in the north seas; the largest sort are found about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENLAND\">Greenland</a> or Spitzbergen. At the first discovery of this country, whales not being used to be disturbed, frequently came into the very bays, and were accordingly killed almost close to the shore; so that the blubber being cut off was immediately boiled into oil on the spot. The ships in those times took in nothing but the pure oil and the whalebone, and all the butinels was executed in the country; by which means a ship could bring home the product of many more whales than she can, according to the present method of conducting this trade. The fishery also was then so plentiful, that they were obliged sometimes to send other ships to fetch off the oil they had made, the quantity being more than the fishing ships could bring away. But time and change of circumstances have shifted the situation of this trade. The ships coming in such numbers from Holland, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>, Hamburgh, and other northern countries, all intruders upon the English, who were the first discoverers of Greenland, the whales were disturbed, and gradually, as other fish often do, forsaking the place, were not to be killed so near the shore as before; but are now found, and have been so ever since, in the openings and spaces among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>, where they have deep water, and where they go sometimes a great many leagues from the shore.\n\nThe whale fishery begins in May, and continues all June and July; but whether the ships have good or bad success, they must come away, and get clear of the ice, by the end of August; so that in the month of September at farthest they may be expected home; but a ship that meets with a fortunate and early fishery in May may return in June or July.\n\nBut, for the manner of taking whales, and for a farther account of the whale fishery, as a trade, see Cetology.","sp":271,"ep":278},{"h":"FISHGARD","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> FISGARD, a town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEMBROKE\">Pembroke</a>-shire, situated on a steep cliff on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-shore, 254 miles from","sp":278,"ep":278},{"h":"FISHING","t":"in general, the art of catching fish, whether by means of nets, of spears, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> of the line and hook.\n\nFISHING in the great, performed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>, spear, or harpoon, for fish that go in shoals, has been explained in the preceding article. That performed by the rod, line, and hook, for solitary fish, is usually termed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ANGLING\">ANGLING</a>: See that article; and for the particular manner of angling for the different kinds of fish, see their respective names, as DACE, EEL, PERCH, under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ICHTHYOLOGY\">ICHTHYOLOGY</a>.\n\nHere we shall give an account of the following:\n\n1. The Barbel, so called on account of the barb or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a> that is under his chops), though a coarse fish, gives considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> to the angler's ingenuity. They swim together in great shoals, and are at their worst in April, at which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> they spawn, but come soon in season; the places whither they chiefly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a>, are such as are weedy and gravelly rising grounds, in which this fish is said to dig and root with his nose like a swine. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> he frequents the strongest, swiftest, currents of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; as deep bridges, weirs, &c., and is apt to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> himself among the piles, hollow places, and mows, or weeds; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> remain there immoveable; but in the winter he retires into deep waters, and helps the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> to make a hole in the sands to hide her spawn in, to hinder its being devoured by other fish. He is a very curious and cunning fish; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> his baits be not sweet, clean, well scoured, and kept in sweet mows, he will not bite; but well ordered and curiously kept, he will bite with great eagerness. The best bait for him is the spawn of a salmon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TROUT\">trout</a>, or any other fish; and if you would have good sport with him, bait the places where you intend to fish with it a night or two before, or with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a> cut in pieces; and the earlier in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> or the later in the evening that you fish, the better it will be. Your rod and line must be both strong and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, with a running plummet on the line; and let a little bit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> be placed a foot or more above the hook, to keep the bullet from falling on it; so the worm will be at the bottom, where they always bite; and when the fish takes the bait, your plummet will rise and not choke him. By the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> of your rod you may know when he bites, as also with your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> you will feel him make a strong snatch; then strike, and you will rarely fail, if you play him well; but if you manage him not dexterously, he will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> your line. The best time for fishing is about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> in the morning, and the most proper season is the latter end of May, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>, and the beginning of August.\n\n2. The Bleak, is an eager fish, caught with all sorts of worms bred on trees or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>; as also with flies, paste, sheep's blood, &c. They may be angled for with half a score of hooks at once, if they can be all fastened on; he will also in the evening take a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> fly. If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> be warm and clear, there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> fly so good for him as the small fly at the top of the water, which he will take at any time of the day, especially in the evening; but if the day is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and cloudy, gentles and caddis are the best; about two feet under water. No fish yields better sport to a young angler than the bleak. It is so eager, that it will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAP\">leap</a> out of the water for a bait.\n\nThere is another way of taking bleak, which is by whipping them in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>, or on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> side in fresh water in a summer's evening, with a hazel top about five or six feet long and a line twice the length of the rod. But the best method is with a drabble, thus: Tie eight or ten small hooks across a line two inches above one another; the biggest hook the lowermost, (whereby you may sometimes take a better fish), and bait them with gentles, flies, or some small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> worms, by which means you may take half a dozen or more at a time.\n\n3. For the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-BREAM\">Bream</a>, observe the following directions, which will also be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARP\">carp</a> fishing.\u2014Procure about prins, i.e., a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUART\">quart</a> of large red worms; put them into fresh mows, well washed and dried every three or four days, feeding them with fat mould and chopped fennel, and they will be thoroughly scoured in about three weeks.\n\nLet your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, but all silk is the best; let the floats be either swan-quills or goose-quills. Let your plumb be a piece of lead in the shape of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEAR\">pear</a>, with a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> at the little end of it; fasten the lead to the line, and the line hook to the lead, about ten or twelve inches space between lead and hook will be enough; and take care the lead be heavy enough to sink the float. Having baited your hook well with a strong worm, the worm will draw the hook up and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in the bottom, which will provoke the bream to bite the more eagerly. It will be best to fit up three or four rods and lines in this manner, and let them as will be directed, and this will afford you much the better sport. Find the exact depth of the water if possible, that your float may swim on its surface directly over the lead; then provide the following ground bait. Take about a peck of sweet grofs-ground malt; and having boiled it a very little, strain it hard through a bag, and carry it to the water side where you have founded; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where you suppose the fish frequent, there throw in the malt by handfuls squeezed hard together, that the stream may not separate it before it comes to the bottom; and be sure to throw it in at least a yard above the place where you intend the hook shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a>, otherwise the stream will carry it down too far. Do this about nine o'clock at night, keeping some of the malt in the bag, and go to the place about three the next morning; but approach very warily, lest you should be seen by the fish; for it is certain that they have their sentinels watching on the top of the water, while the rest are feeding below. Having baited your hook so that the worm may crawl to and fro, the better to allure the fish to bite, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> it in at the place where you find the fish to stay most, which is generally in the broadest and deepest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the river, and so that it may rest about the midst of your bait that is on the ground. Cast in your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> line so that it may rest a yard above that, and a third about a yard below it. Let your rods lie on the bank with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> to keep them down at the great ends; and then withdraw yourself, yet not so far but that you can have your eye upon\nFishing.\n\nupon all the floats; and when you see one bitten and carried away, do not be too hasty to run in, but give time to the fish to tire himself, and then touch him gently. When you perceive the float link, creep to the water side, and give it as much line as you can. If it is a bream or carp, they will run to the other side; which strike gently, and hold your rod at a bent a little while; but do not pull, for then you will spoil all; but you must first tire them before they can be landed, for they are very fly. If there are any carps in the river, it is an even wager that you take one or more of them; but if there are any pike or perch, they will be sure to visit the ground bait, though they will not touch it, being drawn thither by the great resort of the small fish; and until you remove them, it is in vain to think of taking the bream or carp. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, bait one of your hooks with a small bleak, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ROACH\">roach</a>, or gudgeon, about two feet deep from your float, with a little red worm at the point of your hook; and if a pike be there, he will be sure to snap at it. This sport is good till nine o'clock in the morning; and, in a gloomy day, till night; but do not frequent the place too much, lest the fish grow fly.\n\n4. The carp +. A person who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> for carp must arm himself with abundance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>, because of its extraordinary subtlety and policy; they always choose to lie in the deepest places, either of ponds or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, where there is but a small running stream.\n\nFurther, observe, that they will seldom bite in cold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>; and you cannot be too early or too late at the spot in hot weather; and if he bite, you need not fear his hold; for he is one of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>-mouthed fish that have their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> in their throat.\n\nNeither must you forget, in angling for him, to have a strong rod and line; and since he is so very wary, it will be proper to entice him, by baiting the ground with a coarse paste.\n\nHe seldom refuses the red worm in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, the caddis in June, or the grasshopper in June, April, and September.\n\nThis fish does not only delight in worms, but also in sweet paste; of which there is great variety; the best is made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, and ought to be thrown into the water some hours before you begin to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>; neither will small pellets thrown into the water two or three days before be worse for this purpose, especially if chickens' guts, garbage, or blood mixed with bran and cow dung, be also thrown in.\n\nBut more particularly, as to a paste very proper for this use, you may make it in the manner following: Take a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of flour, and mingle it with veal, cut small, making it up with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> of honey; then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> all together in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a> till they are so tough as to hang upon the hook without wailing off. In order to effect which the better, mingle whitish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> with it; and if you keep it all the year round, add some virgin wax and clarified honey.\n\nAgain, If you fish with gentles, anoint them with honey, and put them on your hook, with a deep scarlet dipped in the like, which is a good way to deceive the fish.\n\nHoney and crumbs of wheat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, mixed together, make also a very good paste.\n\nIn taking a carp either in pond or river, if the angler intends to add profit to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, he must take a peck of ale-grains, and a good quantity of any blood to mix with the grains, baiting the ground with it where he intends to angle. This food will wonderfully attract the feafe-fills, as carp, tench, roach, dace, and bream.\n\nLet him angle in a morning, plumbing his ground, and angling for carp with a strong line: the bait must be either paste or a knotted red worm; and by this means he will have sport enough.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a> of proper Baits for the several sorts of Fish referred to in the annexed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">Table</a>.\n\nFlies.]\n1. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">Stone</a> fly, found under hollow stones at the sides of rivers, is of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> streaks on the back and belly, has large wings, and is in season from April to July.\n2.

Grasshopper.\n\nFishing Fly, a bait used in angling for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> kinds of fish. See Fishing.\n\nThe fly is either natural or artificial.\n\nI. Natural flies are innumerable. The more usual for this purpose are mentioned in the preceding page.\n\nThere are two ways to fish with natural flies; either on the surface of the water, or a little underneath it.\n\nIn angling for chub, roach, or dace, move not your natural fly swiftly when you see the fish make at it; but rather let it glide freely towards him with the stream; but if it be in a still and slow water, draw the fly slowly sidewise by him, which will make him eagerly pursue.\n\nII. The artificial fly is seldom used but in blustering weather, when the waters are so troubled by the winds, that the natural fly cannot be seen, nor rest upon them. Of this artificial fly there are reckoned no less than 12 sorts, of which the following are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a>.\n\n1. For March, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUN\">dun</a> fly; made of dun wool, and the feathers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTRIDGE\">partridge</a>'s wing; or the body made of black wool, and the feathers of a black drake. 2. For April, the stone fly; the body made of black wool, dyed yellow under the wings and tail. 3. For the beginning of May, the ruddy fly; made of red wool, and bound about with black silk, with the feathers of a black <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPON\">capon</a> hanging dangling on his sides next his tail. 4. For June, the greenish fly; the body made of black wool, with a yellow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> on either side, the wings taken off the wings of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUZZARD\">buzzard</a>, bound with black broken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a>. 5. The moorish fly, the body made of darkish wool, and the wings of the blackfish mail of a drake. 6. The tawny fly, good till the middle of June; the body made of tawny wool, the wings made contrary one against the other of the whitish mail of a white drake. 7. For July, the wasp fly; the body made of black wool, cast about with yellow silk, and the wings of drakes feathers. 8. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> fly; good in the middle of July; the body made with greenish wool, cast about with the feathers of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PEACOCK\">peacock</a>'s tail, and the wings made of those of the buzzard. 9. For August, the drake fly; the body made with black wool cast about with black silk; his wings of the mail of a black drake, with a black head.\n\nThe best rules for artificial fly fishing are,\n\n1. To fish in a river somewhat disturbed with rain; or in a cloudy day, when the waters are moved by a gentle breeze; the fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> is best; and if the wind blow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, yet not so but that you may conveniently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> your tackle, the fish will rise in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> deeps; but if the wind be small, the best angling is in swift streams.\n\n2. Keep as far from the water side as may be; fish down the stream with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> at your back, and touch not the water with your line. 3. Ever angle in clear rivers, with a small fly and slender wings; but in muddy places, use a larger. 4. When, after rain, the water becomes brownish, use an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a> fly; in a clear day, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>-colored fly; a dark fly for dark waters, &c. 5. Let the line be twice as long as the rod, unless the river be encumbered with wood. 6. For every sort of fly, have several of the same differing in colour, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> with the different complexions of several waters and weathers. 7. Have a nimble eye, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> hand, to strike presently with the rising of the fish; or else he will be apt to spue out the hook. 8. Let the fly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> first into the water, and not the line, which will scare the fish. 9. In slow rivers, or still places, cast the fly across the river, and let it sink a little in the water, and draw it gently back with the current.\n\nSalmon flies should be made with their wings standing one behind the other, whether two or four. This fish delights in the gaudiest colours that can be; chiefly in the wings, which must be long, as well as the tail.","sp":278,"ep":281},{"h":"FISHING BY","t":"g by means of birds, a method peculiar to the Chinese, who train certain birds for the purpose in the same manner as falcons are taught to pursue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAME\">game</a>. For this purpose they have trained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of pelican, resembling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> corvornant, which they call the Lew-tze, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a>. Sir George Staunton, who, when the embassy was proceeding on the southern branch of the great canal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> those birds employed, tells us, that on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> lake, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the east side of the canal, are thousands of small boats and rafts, built entirely for this species of fishery. On each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> or raft are ten or a dozen birds, which, at a signal from the owner, plunge into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; and it is astonishing to see the enormous size of fish with which they return, grasped within their bills. They appeared to be so well trained, that it did not require either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> about their throats to prevent them from swallowing any portion of their prey, except what their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> was pleased to return to them for encouragement and food. The boat used by these fishermen is of a remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> make, and is often carried to the lake, together with the fishing birds, by the men who are there to be supported by it.\n\nThe same author saw the fishermen busy on the great lake Wee-chaung-hee; and he gives the following account of a very singular method practised by them for catching the fish of the lake without the aid of birds, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>, or of hooks. To one side of a boat a flat board, painted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, is fixed, at an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of about 45 degrees, the edge inclining towards the water. On moonlight nights the boat is so placed that the painted board is turned to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, from whence the rays of light striking on the whitened surface, give to it the appearance of moving water; on which the fish being tempted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAP\">leap</a> as on their element, the boatmen raising with a string the board, turn the fish into the boat.\n\nWater-fowl are much sought after by the Chinese, and are taken upon the same lake by the following ingenious device. Empty jars or gourds are suffered to float about upon the water, that such objects may become familiar to the birds. The fisherman then wades into the lake with one of those empty vessels upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, and walks gently towards a bird; and lifting up his arm, draws it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> below the surface of the water without any disturbance or giving alarm to the rest, several of whom he treats in the same manner, until he fills the bag he had brought to hold his prey. The contrivance itself is not so singular, as it is that the same exactly should have occurred in the new continent, as\nAn Epitome of the whole art of **Fishing**, wherein is shown (at one view), the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>, seasons, and depths, for catching all sorts of fish usually angled for; also the various baits for each, so digested as to contain the essence of all the treatises ever written on the subject, exempt from the superfluities, which tend more to perplex than instruct.\n\n| Names        | Where found                                      | Season          | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">Time</a> to ang.    | Depth from ground |\n|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-BREAM\">Bream</a>        | Rough str. river or mid. pond                   | Apr. to Mich.   | Sunrise to 9 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">Sun</a> set | Touch ground     |\n| Barbel       | Gravel banks in currents under bridges         | Apr. to Aug.    | Very early or late | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DITTO\">Ditto</a>             |\n| Bleak        | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">Sandy</a> bottom, deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>                       | May to Oct.     | All <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>         | Six inches from bottom |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARP\">Carp</a>         | Still deep mud bottom, pond or river            | May to Aug.     | Sunrise to 9 Sun set | Three inches from bottom |\n| Chub or Chevin | Ditto                                           | May to Dec.     | Ditto            | Mid water        |\n| Dace         | Sandy bottom deep rivers, ships sterns          | May to Oc.      | All day         | Six to 12 inches from bottom |\n| Gudgeon Pike | Gravel shoals                                    | May to Oc.      | Ditto            | Near or on the ground |\n| Perch        | River in stream                                 | May to Aug.     | Sunrise to 10 Sun set | Ditto             |\n| Pope         | Deep holes in rivers                             | Aug. to May     | Mid day         | Six inches from bottom |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ROACH\">Roach</a>        | Sandy bottom, deep rivers                       | May to Oc.      | Ditto            | Six to 12 inches |\n| Salmon       | Deep rivers                                     | Mar. to Sept.   | 8 to 9, 3 to 6   | Mid way to the bottom |\n| Smelts       | Ships sterns and docks                           | Apr. to Oc.     | All day         | Mid way to the bottom Variable |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TROUT\">Trout</a>        | Purling stream and eddies of stony bottom river | Mar. to Mich.   | Ditto            | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">Cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, 6 inches to 9 Hot weather, top to mid wat. |\n| Tench        | Mud bottom river or pond                         | All the year.   | Sunrise to 9 Sun set | Cold wea., 3 inches from bot. |\n| Umber or Grayling | Clay bottom, swift stream                      | All the year.   | All day         | Cold weather, 6 to 9 inches Hot weather, top to mid wat. |\n\n| Proper Baits |\n|--------------|\n| Flies. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a>\u00b0  | Flats.

Of these there are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> kinds, some made of Mulcory cluck quills, which are the bait for the thank, yet somewhat thick in the circumference; flow waters; but for fishing flames, found cork, wimple, made of fluffs or holes, bored through with a hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, minus.\nFor setting the hook on, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> strong but small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, laying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> on the inside of your hook; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it be on the outside, the silk <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> fret and cut it asunder.\n\nThere are several sizes of these fishing hooks, some big, some little; and of these, some have peculiar names; as, 1. Single hooks. 2. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">Double</a> hooks; which have two bendings, one contrary to the other. 3. Snappers, or gorgers, which are the hooks to whip the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> fly upon, or bait with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> fly. 4. Springers, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> hooks; a kind of double hooks, with a spring, which flies open upon being struck into any fish, and so keeps its mouth open.\n\nFishing-Line, is either made of hair twisted; or silk; or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> grass. The best colours are the sotrel, white, and gray; the two last for clear waters, the first for muddy ones. Nor is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> watery green desirable; this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> is given artificially, by steeping the hair in a liquor made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>, root, and the juice of walnut leaves, boiled together.\n\nFishing-Rod, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> slender rod or wand, to which the line is fastened, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ANGLING\">angling</a>.\u2014Of these there are several sorts; as, 1.

Here he studied during five years, and delighted so much in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> straight and curved figures, that his mother called him the *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALMANACK\">almanack</a>-maker.* He went afterward to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALZBURG\">Salzburg</a>, where he studied a regular course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, and particularly turned his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> under a professor Stuard, whose method of teaching that science was truly extraordinary, as he never made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of any figures, and yet conveyed such a clear idea of every proposition as made it perfectly easy. He was admitted as a novice into Kremnitz in 1737, and the next year he took the solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOW\">vow</a> in presence of his uncle. After being two years in this monastery, during which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he devoted every leisure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of mathematics and philosophy, he went to Salzburg to finish his studies in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">jurisprudence</a>, acquiring at that time a competent knowledge of oriental and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> languages, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> and antiquities. In the year 1745, he obtained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of D.D., after which he received <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>'s orders in his own monastery, and was created professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, which office he held for 40 years, discharging the duties belonging to it till within a few days of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>.

He was, by the intrigues of his friends, induced to publish his *Reipublicae sacrae origines divinae, seu Ecclesiae Christi exterior junctura, imperium, et hierarchia, ex primigenia ejus institutione eruta et demonstrata.* His commendable diligence procured him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> esteem, but it was his knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a> which rendered him illustrious. His uncle Alexander fitted up an apartment for containing the instruments necessary for the dissemination of mathematical knowledge, and he also erected an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">observatory</a>, which was begun in 1748, and completed in 1758, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of Anhelm Dering of Emstorf, a celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a>. While the observatory was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, Fixmillner led a life of retirement and severe study; his favourite subject during these ten years being astronomy. When it was finished, one Dobler, a celebrated mathematician, was appointed first astronomer; but the successors of Fixmillner's uncle having discovered his extensive mathematical knowledge, made him an offer of the astronomical department, and the sole direction of the observatory: This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> he accepted in the year 1762, still retaining his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> as professor of ecclesiastical law. He was not yet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the learning which practical astronomy requires, to remedy which defect he attentively perused Lalande's *Exposition du Calcul Astronomique,* soon after which he obtained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> astronomical work of the same great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, and in 1766 he published his *Meridianus Specul\u00e6 Astronomic\u00e6 Cremifanensis,* by which he acquired considerable reputation. Ten years after this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> he gave the world his *Decennium Astronomicum,* containing many curious and important particulars respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> and practice of astronomy. His *Acta Astronomic\u00e6 Cremifanensis,* which did not appear till after his decease, still farther increased his astronomical reputation; and he was a large contributor to many periodical publications in different countries.\n\nHe made and collected a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of observations of the planet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a>, which were at that period both scarce and difficult, the importance of which was publicly acknowledged by Lalande, as they greatly assisted him in constructing his tables of that planet. Fixmillner was one of the first astronomers who calculated the orbit of the new planet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-URANUS\">Uranus</a> (Georgium Sidus), and his tables reflecting it may be seen in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a> almanack for 1789. He also proved the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of what was formerly conjecture, that the 34th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a> of Taurus, which Flamsteed observed in 1690, was the new planet. It may be said of most philosophers, that they observe a great\ngreat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a>, and calculate little, but the conduct of Fixmillner was exactly the reverse. He turned his attention to the observation of the solar spots more than any of his predecessors, which he noticed in the years 1767, 1776, 1777, 1778, and 1782, from which he deduced important inferences respecting the revolution of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> on its axis.\n\nHe had a genius uncommonly adapted to the study of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, by which he was enabled to invent a new micrometer, and a machine for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> concentric circles. As an additional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of his profound inventive genius, he resided in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, by which means he was in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> deprived of literary affluence, yet to the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of life he was a singular instance of the most indefatigable zeal, diligence, and perseverance. He was little subject to the influence of the turbulent passions;\u2014perhaps less so than most other men. Like the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> which it was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> delight to study, he was simple, uniform, and constant; and such were the mildness and integrity of his character, that he could not fail to acquire the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> and esteem of mankind. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> reputation never inspired him with vanity, and he rather wished to conceal than to propagate what was written in his praise. It gave general joy to his monastic brethren to celebrate the anniversary of the fiftieth year of his residence in it, which he did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> survive. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> was very much impaired by his intense application, and he finished his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> on the 27th of August 1791, in the 71st year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>.","sp":284,"ep":285},{"h":"FLAG","t":"in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a>, a certain banner <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> standard, by which an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a> is distinguished at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> from the inferior ships of his squadron; also the colours by which one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> is distinguished from another.

It was in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> no more than the effect of an indiscreet zeal. A great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of persons of all ages and sexes made processions, walking two by two with their shoulders bare, which they whipped till the blood ran down, in order to obtain mercy from God, and appease his indignation against the wickedness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. They were then called the devout; and having established a superior, he was called the general of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>. Though the primitive Flagellantes were exemplary in point of morals.\nFlagolet morals, yet they were joined by a turbulent rabble, who were infected with the most ridiculous and impious opinions; so that the emperors and pontiffs thought proper to put an end to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> frenzy, by declaring all devout whipping contrary to the divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, and prejudicial to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>'s eternal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>.\n\nThis sect revived in Germany towards the middle of the next century, and rambling through many provinces, occasioned great disturbances.

The name flame, how-\never, is most generally applied to such as are of a conical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, like those arising from our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> fires; without this, they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called luminous vapours, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> simply lights.\n\nAccording to Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton, flame is only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>-hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>, or the vapour of any substance raised from it by fire, and heated to such a degree as to emit light copiously. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> seems to be the most accurate and expressive of any. It is certain, that bodies are capable of emitting flame only in proportion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of vapour that rises from them. Thus wood, coals, &c., which emit a great quantity of vapour, flame violently; while <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, tin, &c., which emit but a small fume, can scarce be perceived to flame at all.\n\nThis rule, however, is by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means to be depended upon in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>. Some vapours seem to be in their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> inflammable, and capable of extinguishing flame; as those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, the mineral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>, sal-ammoniac, arsenic, &c.; while others take fire on the slightest approach of a flaming substance; such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a>, spirit of wine, &c. These last mentioned substances also exhibit a remarkable phenomenon; namely, that they cannot be made to flame without the approach of some substance actually in flames beforehand. Thus, spirit of wine poured on a red-hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, though instantly dissipated in vapour, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not flame; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> touches its surface, the whole is set in flame at once. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is otherwise with oils, especially those of the grocer's kind; for the vapours will readily be changed into flame by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> increase of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, without the approach of any flaming substance.\n\nThere is, however, no kind of vapour, perhaps, that is incapable of being converted into flame, provided it is exposed to a sufficient degree of heat. Thus the vapour of water made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through burning coals produces an exceedingly strong and bright flame.\u2014It is remarkable, that this kind of vapour seems to be more powerful than almost any other in absorbing heat, and retaining it in a latent state. When any quantity of aqueous vapour is condensed, more heat will be separated from it than would have been sufficient to heat an equal bulk of iron red-hot.\u2014It is most probably to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> which all vapours have of absorbing heat, and detaining it in a latent state, that we are to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> the phenomena of flame, and also the exceeding great elasticity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>. It is certain, that vapours, of water at least, have a much greater power of absorbing and retaining heat, than the water from which they are raised. In open vessels, water cannot be heated more than to 212 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer; but in Papin's digester, where the vapour is forcibly confined, it has been heated to 400 of the same degrees; and, no doubt, might have been heated a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> more, had the vessels been strong enough to bear the expansive force of the steam. On opening the vessels, however, the excess of heat was found to have resided entirely in the vapour; for the water in the vessel very soon sunk <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to 212, while the steam issued forth with great violence.\n\nFrom these experiments it appears, that the steam of water, after it has absorbed as much heat in a latent state as it can contain, continues to absorb, or detain among its particles, an unlimited quantity of sensible heat; and if the steam could be confined till this quantity became great enough to be visible by its emission of light, there cannot be the least doubt that the vapour would then be converted into flame.\n\nIn what manner the heat is detained among the particles of steam, is perhaps impossible to be explained; but to this heat we must undoubtedly ascribe the violent expansive force of steam of every kind. It seems probable, that when smoke is converted into flame, the latent heat with which the vapour had combined, or rather that which made an essential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of it, breaks forth, and adds to the quantity of sensible heat which is already present. This seems probable, from the sudden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a> with which all flames <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> out. If a vessel full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> is set over the fire, a smoke or vapour begins to arise from it; which grows gradually thicker and thicker; and at last begins to thine in some places very near the surface of the oil, like an electric light, or sulphur <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> kindled. At this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the oil is very hot, as well as the steam which issues from it. But this last is continually giving off its sensible heat into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>; so that at the distance of an inch or two from the surface of the oil, the heat of the steam will not exceed 400 degrees of Fahrenheit, or perhaps may not be so much; but if a burning candle is held in the steam for a moment, the whole is immediately converted into flame, with something like an explosion; after which, the oil burns quietly until it is all consumed. The flame, as soon as it appears, is not only much hotter than the steam from whence it was produced, but even than the oil which lies below it. Whence, then, has this sudden and great increase of heat arisen? It could not be the sensible heat of the vapour, for that was greatly inferior; nor could it be communicated from the oil, for that could communicate no more than it had to itself. The candle, indeed, would communicate a quantity of heat to the vapour which touched its flame; but it is impossible that this quantity should extend permanently over a surface perhaps 100 times larger than the flame of the candle, in such a manner as to make every part of that surface equally hot with the flame of the candle itself; for this would be to suppose it to communicate 100 times more heat than really was in it. The heat therefore must have originally resided in the vapour itself; and as, in the freezing of water, its latent heat is extricated and becomes sensible, and the water thereupon loses its fluidity; so, in the ascension of vapour, the latent heat breaks forth with a bright flash, and the vapour is then totally decomposed, and converted into foot, ashes, or water, according to the different nature of the substances which produce it, or according to the intensity of the heat.\u2014Several other hypotheses have been invented to solve the phenomena of burning and flaming bodies; for an account of which, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNITION\">Ignition</a> and Heat, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>.\n\nFlames are of different colours, according to the substances from which they are produced. Thus, the flame of sulphur and spirit of wine is blue; the flame of nitre and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a>, of a bright <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>; that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, of a greenish blue, &c.\u2014These varieties afford an opportunity of making a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of agreeable representations in fireworks, which could not be done if the flame produced from every different substance was of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>.

May not this arise principally from the strong attraction which subsists between wool and the watery vapour which is continually issuing from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> body? That it does not depend entirely on the warmth of that covering, is clear; for the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of warmth produced by wearing more clothing of a different kind, does not produce the same effect. The perspiration of the human body being absorbed by a covering of flannel, it is immediately distributed through the whole thickness of that substance, and by that means exposed, by a very large surface, to be carried off by the atmosphere; and the loss of this watery vapour which the flannel sustains on the one side by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>, being immediately restored from the other, in consequence of the strong attraction between the flannel and this vapour, the pores of the skin are disencumbered, and they are continually surrounded by a dry and salubrious atmosphere.\"","sp":289,"ep":290},{"h":"FLANK","t":"in Fortification, is a line drawn from the extremity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> towards the inside of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">Or</a>, flank is that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a battalion which reaches from the curtain to the face, and defends the opposite face, the flank, and the curtain.

See LINUM, BOTANY <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>.\n\nThe following particulars with regard to the manner of raising flax, have been some years past warmly recommended by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TRUSTEES\">trustees</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>, and improvements in Scotland.\n\nOf the choice of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">Soil</a>, and preparing the Ground for Flax. A skilful flax-raiser always prefers a free open deep loam; and all grounds that produced the preceding year a good crop of turnip, cabbage, potatoes, barley, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> clover, or have been formerly laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> rich, and kept for some years in pasture.\n\nA clay soil, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> or third crop after being limed, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> answer well for flax; provided, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the ground be still stiff, that it be brought to a proper mould, by tilling after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> to expose it to the winter frosts.\n\nAll new grounds produce a strong crop of flax, and pretty free of weeds. When a great many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOLE\">mole</a> heaps appear upon new ground, it answers the better for flax, after one tilling.\n\nFlax seed ought never to be sown on grounds that are either too wet or dry; but on such as retain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> moisture: and such grounds as are inclined to weeds ought to be avoided, unless prepared by a careful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> fallow.\n\nIf the linseed be sown early, and the flax not allowed to stand for seed, a crop of turnip may be got after the flax that very year; the second year a crop of bear or barley may be taken; and the third year, grass seeds are sometimes sown along with the linseed. This is the method mostly practised in and about the counties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a> and Somerset, where great quantities of flax and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a> are every year raised, and where these crops have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>. There, old ploughed grounds are never sown with linseed, unless the soil be very rich and clean. A certain worm, called in Scotland the coup worm, abounds in grounds newly broken up, and greatly hurts every crop but flax. In small enclosures surrounded with trees or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> hedges, the flax, for want of free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, is subject to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> before it be ripe; and the droppings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a> from the trees prevent the flax, within the reach of the trees, from growing to any perfection.\n\nOf preceding crops, potatoes and hemp are the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> for flax. In the fens of Lincoln, upon proper ground of old tillage, they sow hemp, dunging well the first year; the second year, hemp without dung; the third year, flax without dung; and that same year, a crop of turnip eaten on the ground by sheep; the fourth year, hemp with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> coat of dung; and so on for ever.\n\nIf the ground be free and open, it should be but once ploughed; and that as shallow as possible, not deeper than 2\u00bd inches. It should be laid flat, reduced to a fine garden mould by much harrowing, and all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> and lods should be carried off.\n\nExcept a little pigeons dung for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> or four ground, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other dung should be used preparatory for flax; because it produces too many weeds, and throws up the flax thin and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> upon the stalk.\n\nBefore sowing, the bulky clods should be broken, or carried off the ground; and stones, quickenings, and every other thing that may hinder the growth of the flax should be removed.\n\nOf the choice of Linseed. The brighter in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and heavier the seed is, so much the better; that which when bruised appears of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> or yellowish green, and fresh in the heart, oily and not dry, and smells and tastes sweet, and not fusty, may be depended upon.\n\nDutch seed of the preceding year's growth, for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>, answers best; but it seldom succeeds if kept another year. It ripens sooner than any other foreign seed. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILADELPHIA\">Philadelphia</a> seed produces fine lint and few bolls, because sown thick, and answers best in wet cold soils. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGA\">Riga</a> seed produces coarser lint, and the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of seed. Scots seed, when well winned and kept, and changed from one kind of soil to another, sometimes answers pretty well; but should be sown thick, as many of its grains are bad, and fail. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> well, and its flax is sooner ripe than any other; but its produce afterwards is generally inferior to that from foreign seed.\n\nA kind has been lately imported called Memmel seed; which looks well, is short and plump, but seldom grows above eight inches, and on that account ought not to be sown.\n\nOf Sowing Linseed. The quantity of linseed sown should be proportioned to the condition of the soil; for if the ground be in good heart, and the seed sown thick, the crop will be in danger of falling before it is ready for pulling. From 11 to 12 pecks Linlithgow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of Dutch or Riga seed, is generally sufficient for one Scots <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>; and about 10 pecks of Philadelphia seed, which, being the smallest grained, goes farthest. Riga linseed, and the next year's produce of it, is preferred in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLNSHIRE\">Lincolnshire</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> for sowing linseed is from the middle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> to the end of April, as the ground and season answers.\nanswers; but the earlier the seed is sown, the less the crop interferes with the corn harvest.\n\nLate sown linseed may grow long, but the flax upon the stalk will be thin and poor.\n\nAfter sowing, the ground ought to be harrowed till the seed is well covered, and then (supposing the soil, as before mentioned, to be free and reduced to a fine mould) it ought to be rolled.\n\nWhen a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> sows a large quantity of linseed, he may find it proper to sow a part earlier and part later, that in the future operations of weeding, pulling, watering, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAFTING\">grafting</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> may be the easier and more conveniently gone about.\n\nIt ought always to be sown on a dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>.\n\nOf Weeding Flax. It ought to be weeded when the crop is about four inches long. If longer deferred, the weeder will too much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> and crook the stalks, that they will never perhaps recover their straightness again; and when the flax grows crooked, it is more liable to be hurt in the rippling and swinging.\n\nQuicken grass should not be taken up; for, being strongly rooted, the pulling of it always loosens a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of the lint.\n\nIf there is an appearance of a settled drought, it is better to defer the weeding, than by that operation to expose the tender roots of the flax to the drought.\n\nHow soon the weeds are got out, they ought to be carried off the field, instead of being laid in the furrows, where they often take root again, and at any rate obstruct the growth of the flax in the furrows.\n\nOf Pulling Flax. When the crop grows so short and branchy, as to appear more valuable for seed than flax, it ought not to be pulled before it be thoroughly ripe; but if it grows long and not branchy, the seed should be disregarded, and all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> given to the flax. In the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> it ought to be pulled after the bloom has fallen, when the stalk begins to turn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, and before the leaves fall, and the bolls turn hard and sharp pointed.\n\nWhen the stalk is small, and carries few bolls, the flax is fine; but the stalk of coarse flax is grofs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, branchy, and carries many bolls.\n\nWhen the flax has fallen, and lies, such as lies ought to be immediately pulled, whether it has grown enough or not, as otherwise it will rot altogether.\n\nWhen parts of the same field grow unequally, so that some parts are ready for pulling before other parts; only what is ready should be pulled, and the rest should be suffered to stand till ready.\n\nThe flax-raiser ought to be at pains to pull and keep by itself, each different kind of lint which he finds in his field; what is both long and fine, by itself; what is both long and coarse, by itself; what is both short and fine, by itself; what is both short and coarse, by itself; and in like manner every other kind by itself that is of the same size and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. If the different kinds be not thus kept separate, the flax must be much damaged in the watering and the other succeeding operations.\n\nWhat is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called under-growth may be neglected as useless.\n\nFew persons that have seen pulled flax, are ignorant of the method of laying it in handfuls across each other; which gives the flax sufficient air, and keeps the handfuls separate and ready for the rippler.\n\nOf Stacking up Flax during the Winter, and Winning the Seed. If the flax be more valuable than the seed, it ought by no means to be stacked up; for its own natural juice affords it greatly in the watering; whereas, if kept long unwatered, it looses that juice, and the harle adheres so much to the boon, that it requires longer time to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and even the quality of the flax becomes thereby harsher and coarser. Besides, the flax attacked over year, is in great danger from vermine and other accidents; the water in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> is not so soft and warm as in harvest; and near a year is thereby lost of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the lint: but if the flax be so short and branchy as to appear most valuable for seed, it ought, after pulling, to be stooked and dried upon the field, as is done with corn; then stacked up for winter, rippled in spring; and after wheeling, the seed should be well cleaned from bad seeds, &c.\n\nOf Rippling Flax. After pulling, if the flax is to be regarded more than the seed, it should be allowed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> some hours upon the ground to dry a little, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> some firmness, to prevent the skin or harle, which is the flax, from rubbing off in the rippling; an operation which ought by no means to be neglected, as the bolls, if put into the water along with the flax, breed vermine there, and otherwise spoil the water. The bolls also prove very inconvenient in the dressing and breaking.\n\nIn Lincolnshire and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, they think that rippling hurts the flax; and therefore, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of rippling, they strike the bolls against a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>.\n\nThe handfuls for rippling should not be great, as that endangers the lint in the rippling comb.\n\nAfter rippling, the flax-raiser will perceive, that he is able to afford each size and quality of the flax by itself more exactly than he could before.\n\nOf Watering Flax. A running stream wastes the lint, makes it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, and frequently carries it away. Lochs, by the great quantity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the water, also whiten and whiten the flax, though not so much as running streams. Both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> and lochs water the flax quicker than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>.\n\nBut all flax ought to be watered in canals, which should be dugged in clay ground if possible, as that soil retains the water best: but if a firm retentive soil cannot be got, the bottom or sides of the canal, or both the bottom and sides, may be lined with clay; or instead of lining the sides with clay, which might fall down, a ditch may be dug without the canal, and filled with clay, which will prevent both extraneous water from entering, and the water within from running off.\n\nA canal of 40 feet long, six broad, and four deep, will generally water the growth of an acre of flax.\n\nIt ought to be filled with fresh soft water from a river or brook, if possible, two or three weeks before the flax is put in, and exposed all that time to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>. The greater way the river or brook has run, the softer, and therefore the better, will the water be. Springs, or short runs from hills, are too cold, unless the water is allowed to stand long in the canal. Water from coal or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> is very bad for flax. A little of the powder of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALLS\">galls</a> thrown into a glass of water, will\nwill immediately discover if it comes from minerals of that kind, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> it into a dark colour, more or less tinged in proportion to the quantity of vitriol it contains.\n\nThe canal ought not to be under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>; which, besides keeping the sun from softening the water, might make part of the canal cooler than other parts, and so water the flax unequally.\n\nThe flax-raiser will observe, when the water is brought to a proper heat, that small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> will be rising quickly in it, numbers of small insects and reptiles will be generating there, and bubbles of air rising on the surface. If no such signs appear, the water must not be warm enough, or is otherwise unfit for flax.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOLD\">Mold</a> holes, when neither too deep nor too shallow, frequently answer well for watering flax, when the water is proper, as before described.\n\nThe proper season for watering flax is from the end of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> to the end of August.\n\nThe advantage of watering flax as soon as possible after pulling, has been already mentioned.\n\nThe flax being forced after rippling, as before mentioned, should next be put in beets, never larger than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> can grasp with both his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and tied very slack with a band of a few stalks. Dried rushes answer exceedingly well for binding flax, as they do not rot in the water, and may be dried and kept for use again.\n\nThe beets should be put into the canals slopewise, or half standing upon end, the root end uppermost. Upon the crop ends, when uppermost, there frequently breeds a deal of vermine, destructive of the flax, which is effectually prevented by putting the crop end downmost.\n\nThe whole flax in the canal ought to be carefully covered from the sun with divots; the grassy side of which should be next the flax, to keep it clean. If it is not thus covered, the sun will discolour the flax, though quite covered with water. If the divots are not weighty enough to keep the flax entirely under water, a few stones may be laid above them. But the flax should not be pressed to the bottom.\n\nWhen the flax is sufficiently watered, it feels soft to the gripe, and the harle parts easily with the boon or bow, which last is then become brittle, and looks whitish. When these signs are found, the flax should be taken out of the water, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> after beat; each gently rinsed in the water, to cleanse it of the nastiness which has gathered about it in the canal; and as the lint is then very tender, and the beat slackly tied, it must be carefully and gently handled.\n\nGreat care ought to be taken that no part be overdone; and as the coarsest waters soonest, if different kinds be mixed together, a part will be rotted, when the rest is not sufficiently watered.\n\nWhen lint taken out of the canal is not found sufficiently watered, it may be laid in a heap for 12, 18, or 24 hours, which will have an effect like more watering; but this operation is nice, and may prove dangerous in unskilful hands.\n\nAfter the flax is taken out of the canal, fresh lint, should not be put a second time into it, until the former water be run off, and the canal cleaned, and supplied with fresh water.\n\nOf Grafting Flax. Short heath is the best field for grafting flax; as, when wet, it fattens to the heath, and is thereby prevented from being blown away by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>. The heath also keeps it a little above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and so exposes it the more equally to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. When such heath is not to be got, links or clean old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a> ground is the next best. Long grass grounds should be avoided, as the grafts growing through the lint frequently spots, tenders, or rots it; and grounds exposed to violent winds should also be avoided.\n\nThe flax, when taken out of the water, must be spread very thin upon the ground; and being then very tender, it must be gently handled. The thinner it is spread the better, as it is then the more equally exposed to the weather. But it ought never to be spread during a heavy shower, as that would wash and waste the harle too much, which is then excessively tender, but soon after becomes firm enough to bear the rains, which, with the open air and sunshine, cleans, softens, and purifies the harle to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> wanted, and makes it bliter from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOOM\">boom</a>. In short, after the flax has got a little firmness by being a few hours spread in dry weather, the more rain and sunshine it gets the better.\n\nIf there be little danger of high winds carrying off the flax, it will be much the better of being turned about once a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>. If it is not to be turned, it ought to be very thin spread. The spreading of flax and hemp requires a deal of ground, and enriches it greatly.\n\nThe skilful flax-raiser spreads his first row of flax at the end of the field opposite to the point from whence the most violent wind commonly comes, placing the root-ends foremost; he makes the root-ends of every other row overlap the crop ends of the former row three or four inches, and binds down the last row with a rope; by which means the wind does not easily get below the lint to blow it away; and as the crop ends are seldom so fully watered as the root ends, the aforesaid overlapping has an effect like giving the crop ends more watering. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">Experience</a> only can fully teach a person the signs of flax being sufficiently grafted: then it is of a clearer colour than formerly; the harle is blittered up, and easily parts with the boon, which is then become very brittle. The whole should be sufficiently grafted before any of it is lifted; for if a part be lifted sooner than the rest, that which remains is in great danger from the winds.\n\nA dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> ought to be chosen for taking up the flax; and if there is no appearance of high wind, it should be loosed from the heath or grafts, and left loose for some hours, to make it thoroughly dry.\n\nAs a great quantity of flax can scarcely be all equally watered and grafted, and as the different qualities will best appear at lifting the flax off the grafts; therefore at that time each different kind should be gathered together, and kept by itself; that is, all of the same colour, length, and quality.\n\nThe smaller the beets lint is made up in, the better for drying, and the more convenient for stacking, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSING\">housing</a>, &c. and in making up these beets, as in every other operation upon flax, it is of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> that the lint be laid together as it grew; the root ends together, and the crop ends together.\nFollows an estimate of the Expence, Produce, and Profit of a Scots Acre of Flax\u2014supposing the season favourable, that no accidental losses happen, and that the farmer is neither unskillful nor negligent.\n\n| Ground rent, labouring the ground, and leading the flax Linseed from 2l. to 4l. per hoghead, the medium 3s. 4d. per peck | A medium crop. | A great crop. | An extra crop. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Clodding and sowing | L. 2 10 | L. 3 10 | L. 5 0 |\n| Weeding | 1 16 8 | 1 10 0 | 1 6 8 |\n| Pulling, rippling, putting in, and covering in the water | 0 2 0 | 0 2 0 | nothing. |\n| Taking out of the water, grassing, and stacking | 0 14 0 | 0 15 0 | 1 0 0 |\n| Breaking and fetching, at 2s. per stone | 0 8 0 | 0 12 0 | 0 18 0 |\n| Total expense | L. 9 2 8 | L. 10 17 | L. 14 6 8 |\n\n| Produce at 10s. per stone. | L. 15 0 | L. 20 0 | L. 30 0 |\n| Linseed sold for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> at 1s. per peck | for 30 stones. | for 40 stones. | for 60 stones. |\n| The chaff of the bolls is well worth the expence of drying the seed; as it is good food, when boiled and mixed with bear, for horses. | 0 16 0 | 0 18 0 | 1 0 0 |\n| Total produce | L. 15 10 | L. 20 18 | L. 31 0 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">Balance</a> for profit | L. 6 14 4 | L. 10 1 | L. 16 13 4 |\n\nThe above estimate being made several years ago, the expence and profit are now different; but the proportions of each are probably the same. There is nothing stated here as expence of the canal in which the flax is watered; because that varies much according to circumstances.\n\nIt is a certain fact, that the greater the crop is, the better is the quality of the same kind of flax.\n\nThe advantage of having both a crop of flax and a crop of turnip the same year\u2014or of sowing grass seeds along with the linseed\u2014and of reducing the ground to a fine garden mould, free of weeds, ought to be attended to.\n\nFor Cambrie and fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAWN\">Lawn</a>.

In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> it ought to have a second ploughing, after a hard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>; and when you intend to sow it, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a> it a third time, or rather hoe it, reducing the clods very fine; but make no furrows: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> must be made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> like a garden; but never work the land when wet.\n\nThe seed should be sown the beginning of April, and about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> the quantity that is generally sown by our farmers; if the land be very rich, it will require rather more than double.\n\nAs soon as sown (if the weather be dry) it will be necessary to roll the ground.\n\nThe lint must be weeded very clean when about three inches high; directly after which you must set forked sticks, of about one and a half inch thick (which ought to be prepared before), every four or five feet, according to the length of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a> you are to lay upon them; they should be well fixed in the ground, the forked part to receive the poles about six or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> inches above the lint; each row of poles should be two, three, or four feet slumber, according to the length of the brushwood you are to lay upon them.\n\nThe poles ought to be from 10 to 15 feet long, and strong enough to support the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> across the poles; take the longest brushwood you can get, the more branchy the better, very thick, filling up the vacancies with smaller brush, and any of the branches that rise higher than 18 or 20 inches ought to be lopped off to make the brush lie as level as possible: any sort of brush will do except oak, as that tinges the lint.\n\nYour lint must be pulled as soon as the seed is fully formed, which is a few days after it is out of the bloom, before the lint turn yellow.\n\nIt must be pulled above the brushwood, and every handful laid upon it as soon as possible: if it is fine weather, leave it four or five hours in that manner: then carry it to a screen near a barn, to put it under cover in case of rain; there it must be spread four or five days, and always put in the barn at night, or when it appears to rain: the bundles must be opened in the barn, or made hollow, to prevent it from heating.\n\nThese operations must be performed until the lint is perfectly dry, and out of danger of heating; taking care all the time to keep the roots as even as possible, and if possible keep it from rain or wet: if you cannot prevent it from being wet, it will be better to leave it on the grass till dry; because when once wet, the putting it under cover before dry will make it turn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>; a thing which must be prevented at all events.\n\nIf any of the lint upon the border, or through the piece of ground, be coarser than another, it must be separated from the rest.\nThe utmost care must be taken to preserve the flax entire or unbroken; for this reason they beat off the feed with a round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALLET\">mallet</a> or bittle.\n\nThe most proper ground is summer fallow, or after potatoes or lea; if possible near a wood, to prevent the expense of carrying brush.\n\nAs soon as the feed is off, if you intend to water it that season, it must be tied in bundles about as large as you can grasp with your two hands.\n\nThe water proper for it, is a very small rivulet or soft spring free of any metallic ore; taking care that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a> or foul water enters your pit; which must be at least five feet deep, about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> or ten broad at the top, and seven or eight at the bottom; the length will depend on the quantity of flax you have to water. A very small stripe of water, when clear, should always be running in and off from your pit when the lint is in it.\n\nThe pit ought to be made three or four months before it is used.\n\nYou must drive poles about four inches thick, with a hook inclining downwards, in this form 7, all along the sides of the pit, above five feet asunder. The hooks must be level with, or rather under, the surface of the water. A long pole, the whole length of the pit, must be fixed into these hooks on each side; and crofs poles put under that, to keep the lint under water; but the crofs poles are not used till the lint is put in. You must order it so, that all the lint should be three or four inches under water. You next bring your lint to the sides of the pit; then put your fleaves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> to head, causing each to overlap the other about one-third, and take as many of these as make a bundle of two or two and a half feet broad, laying the one above the other till it is about four or four and a half feet high; then you tie them together in the middle, and at each root end: after this you wrap your bundle in straw, and lay it in the water, putting the thin or broad side undermost, taking care that none of your lint touch the earth; after it is fully preffed under water, put in your crofs poles to keep it under. The bundles ought to lie in the pit a foot separate from each other. This renders it easy to take out; for, if the bundles entangle, they will be too heavy to raise.\n\nThe time of watering depends so much upon the weather, and softness or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> of the water, that it is impossible to fix any certain time. This must be left to the skill of the farmer. If the flax is intended for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINNING\">spinning</a> yarn soft and fit for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIC\">cambric</a>, it ought to be spread upon short grass for four or five days before you put it into the water; but if for lawns, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LACE\">lace</a>, or thread, it is best to dry it outright. In either case, avoid as much as possible to let it get rain; as much rain blanches and wastes out the oil, which is necessary to preserve the strength.\n\nThe great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of this flax is to be fine and long. Thick sowing raises all plants fine and slender; and when the ground is very rich, it forces them to a great length. Pulling green prevents that coarse hardness which flax has when let stand till it be full ripe, and gives it the fine silky property. The brushwood, when the flax springs up catches it by the middle, and prevents it from lying down and rotting; infallible consequences of sowing thick upon rich ground. It likewise keeps it straight, moist, and soft at the roots; and by keeping it warm, and shaded from the sun, greatly promotes its length. The keeping it from rain, heating, taking proper care of your water, preserves the colour, and prevents those bars in cloth so much complained of by bleachers.\n\n**Flax-Dressing.** For many ages it was the practice to separate the boon or core from the flax, which is the bark of the plant, by the following simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> methods. First, for breaking the boon, the stalks in small parcels were beat with a mallet; or, more dexterously, the break (Plate CCXVIII. fig. 1. and 2.) was used thus: The flax being held in the left hand across the three under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> or swords of the break (A, fig. 1. and a fig. 2.), the upper teeth (B, fig. 1. and b, fig. 2.) were with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> hand quickly and often forced down upon the flax, which was artfully shifted and turned with the left hand. Next, for clearing the flax of the broken boon: the workman with his left hand held the flax over the flock (fig. 3. and 4.), while with his right hand he struck or thrashed the flax with the scutchers (fig. 5.)\n\nThese methods of breaking and scutching the flax being slow and very laborious, a water-mill was invented in Scotland about the year 1750; which, with some improvements, makes great despatch, and in skilful and careful hands gives satisfaction. It has been generally constructed to break the boon by three dentled rollers, placed one above the other. The middle one of which, being forced quickly round, takes the other two along with it, and one end of the handfuls of the flax being by the workmen directed in between the upper and middle rollers, the flax is immediately drawn in by the rollers; a curved board or plate of tin behind the rollers directs the flax to return again between the middle and undermost rollers;\u2014and thus the operation is repeated until the boon be sufficiently broke. Great weights of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> or stone at the ends of levers, press the upper and under rollers towards the middle one.\n\nThe scutching is next carried on by the mill in the following manner: Four arms, something like the hand-scutchers before described, project from a perpendicular axle; a box around the axle encloses these projecting scutchers; and this box is divided among the workmen, each having sufficient room to stand and handle his flax, which, through slits in the upper part and sides of the box, they hold in to the stroke of the scutchers; which, moving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> horizontally, strike the flax across at right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, and so thrash out or clear it of the boon.\n\nThe breaking of the flax by rollers is scarcely subject to any objection, but that it is dangerous to workmen not sufficiently on their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a>, who sometimes allow the rollers to take hold of their fingers, and thereby their whole arm is instantly drawn in: thus many have lost their arms. To avoid this danger, a break, upon the general principles of the hand-break before described, has been lately adapted to water-machinery, and used in place of rollers. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> stroke of the scutchers was long thought too severe, and wasteful of the flax; but very careful experiments have discovered that the waste complained of must be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> to the unskillfulness or negligence of the workmen, as in good hands the mill carries away nothing but what, if not so scutched off, must\nFlax be taken off in the heckling, with more loss both of time and flax. But to obviate this objection of the violence of the horizontal scutchers, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of hand-scutching has lately been applied to water. The scutchers then project from a horizontal axle, and move like the arms of a check reel, striking the flax neither across nor perpendicularly down, but sloping in upon the parcel exactly as the flax is struck by the hand-scutter. This sloping stroke is got by raising the scutching stock some inches higher than the centre of the axle; and by raising or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a> the stock over which the flax is held, or screwing it nearer to or farther from the scutchers, the workman can temper or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> the stroke almost as he pleases.\n\nA lint mill, with horizontal scutchers upon a perpendicular axle, requires a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of two stories, the rollers or break being placed in the ground story, and the scutchers in the loft above; but a mill with vertical scutchers on a horizontal axle, requires but one ground story for all the machinery.\n\nAnother method of breaking and scutching flax, more expeditious than the old hand methods, and more gentle than water <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a>, has also been invented in Scotland. It is much like the break and scutter, giving the slopping stroke last described, moved by the foot. The treddle is remarkably long, and the scutchers are fixed upon the rim of a fly wheel. The foot-break is also assisted in its motion by a fly. These foot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> are very useful where there are no water mills, but they are far inferior to the mills in point of expedition.\n\nThe next operation that flax undergoes after scutching is heckling. The heckle (fig. 6.) is firmly fixed to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENCH\">bench</a> before the workman, who strikes the flax upon the teeth of the heckle, and draws it through the teeth. To persons unacquainted with that kind of work this may seem a very simple operation; but, in fact, it requires as much practice to acquire the flight of heckling well, and without wasting the flax, as any other operation in the whole manufacture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>. They use coarser and wider teathed heckles, or finer, according to the quality of the flax; generally putting the flax through two heckles, a coarser one first, and next a fine one.\n\nFlax for Cambric and fine Lawn, Thread, and Lace, is dressed in a manner somewhat different. It is not scutched so thoroughly as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> flax; which from the scutch proceeds to the heckle, and from that to the spinner; whereas, this fine flax, after a rough scutching, is scraped and cleaned with a blunt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a> upon the workman's knee covered with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> apron; from the knife it proceeds to the spinner, who, with a brush made for the purpose, straightens and dresses each parcel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> before she begins to spin it.\n\nThe following observations on this subject, first published in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">Gentleman</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1787, seem worthy of particular attention.\n\nOf the watering of Flax by a new method, so as to shorten labour, to add probably to the strength of the flax, and to give it a much finer colour, which would render the operation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLEACHING\">bleaching</a> safer and less tedious.\n\n\"Though the following reflections have for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> an improvement in the very essential article of watering of flax, yet I must advertise the reader, that they are only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, and must depend entirely for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTIFICATION\">justification</a> upon future experiments, skilfully and judiciously made. Should repeated trials prove the advantage of the new method proposed, we may venture to affirm, that it would be an improvement that would increase the national income in the agricultural branch many thousand pounds annually, would add greatly to the perfection of the linen manufacture, and over and above would suppress a very disagreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NUISANCE\">nuisance</a>, which the present method of watering flax occasions during some part of the summer in every flax-growing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>.\n\n\"The intention of watering flax is, in my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, to make the boon more brittle or friable, and, by soaking, to dissolve that gluey kind of sap that makes the bark of plants and trees adhere in a small degree to the woody part. The bark of flax is called the harle; and when separated from the useless woody part, the boon, this harle itself is called flax. To effect this separation easily, the practice has long prevailed, of soaking the flax in water to a certain degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a>, and afterwards drying it. For this soaking some prefer rivulets that have a small current, and others stagnant water in ponds and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>. In both methods the water acts as in all other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of infusion and maceration; after two or three weeks it extracts a great many juices of a very strong quality, which in ponds give the water an inky tinge and offensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>; and in rivulets mix in the stream and kill the fish. Nay, if this maceration be too long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, the extracted and fermented sap will completely kill the flax itself. For if, instead of two or three weeks, the new flax were to lie soaking in the water four or five months, I presume it would be good for nothing but to be thrown upon the dunghill; both harle and boon would in time be completely rotted; yet the harle or flax, when entirely freed from this sap, and manufactured into linen, or into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a>, might lie many months under water without being much damaged; as linen, it may be washed and steeped in scalding water twenty times without losing much of its strength; and as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, it acquires a kind of incorruptibility.\n\n\"It appears then essential to the right management of new flax, to get rid of this pernicious vegetative sap, and to macerate the boon; but from the complaints made against both the methods of watering now in use, there is reason to think that there is still great room for improvement in that article. In rivulets, the vegetative sap, as it is dissolved, is carried off by the current, to the destruction of the fish. This prevents the flax from being stained; but the operation is tedious, and not complete, from the uncertainty of knowing when it is just enough, and not too much, or perhaps from neglect. In ponds, the inky tinge of the water often serves as a kind of dye to the flax, which imbibes it so strongly, that double the labour in bleaching will hardly bring the linen made of such flax to an equality in whiteness with linen made of flax untinged. This seems to be equally untrue as though we were to die cotton black first, in order to whiten it afterwards. These ponds, besides, become a great nuisance to the neighbourhood; the impregnated water is often of such a pernicious quality, that cattle,\ncattle, however thirsty, will not drink of it; and the effluvia of it may perhaps be nearly as infectious as it is offensive. If this effluvia is really attended with any contagious effects in our cold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, a thing worth the inquiring into, how much more pernicious must its effects have been in the hot climate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, a country early noted for its great cultivation of flax?\n\n\"I have often thought that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of watering might be greatly improved and shortened by plunging the new flax, after it is rippled, into scalding water; which, in regard to extracting the vegetative sap, would do in five minutes more than cold water would do in a fortnight, or perhaps more than cold water could do at all, in respect to the clearing the plant of sap. Rough almonds, when thrown into scalding water, are blanched in an instant; but perhaps a fortnight's macerating those almonds in cold water would not make them part so easily with their skins, which are the same to them as the harle is to the flax. Were tea leaves to be infused in cold water a fortnight, perhaps the tea produced by that infusion would not be so good to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, or so strongly tinged to the eye, as what is effected by scalding water in five minutes. By the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a>, I think, flax or any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> twig would be made to part with its bark much easier and quicker by being dipped in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water than by being steeped in cold water.\n\n\"This reflection opens a door for a great variety of new experiments in regard to flax. I would therefore recommend to gentlemen cultivators and farmers, to make repeated trials upon this new system, which would soon ascertain whether it ought to be adopted in practice or rejected. One thing, I think, we may be certain of, that if the Egyptians watered their flax in our common manner, they undoubtedly watered it in very warm water, from the great heat of their climate, which would probably make them neglect to think of water heated by any other means than that of the sun. A good general practice can only be established upon repeated trials. Though one experiment may fail, another with a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> may succeed; and the importance of the object desired to be obtained will justify a good degree of perseverance in the prosecution of the means. In this view, as the Chinese thread is said to be very strong, it would be worth while to be acquainted with the practice of that distant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, in regard to the rearing and manufacturing of flax, as well as with the methods used by the Flemings and the Dutch.\n\n\"Boiling water perhaps might at once clear the new flax from many impurities, which when not removed till it be spun into yarn, are then removed with difficulty, and with loss of substance to the yarn. Why should not the longitudinal fibres of the flax, before they be spun into yarn, be made not only as fine but as clean as possible? Upon the new system proposed, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of bleaching would begin immediately after the rippling of the flax; and a little done then, might perhaps <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> much of what is generally done after the spinning and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEAVING\">weaving</a>. To spin dirty flax with a view of cleaning it afterwards, appears to be the same impropriety as though we were to reserve part of the dressing given to leather till after it is made into a glove.\n\n\"Should the plunging of the flax into the boiling water not suffice to make the boon brittle enough, as I am inclined to think it would not, then the common watering might be added; but in that case probably half the time usually given to this watering would suffice, and the flax might then be laid in clear rivulets, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of its infecting the water and poisoning the fish, or of being discoloured itself; for the boiling water into which it had been previously put, would have extracted all the poisonous vegetative sap, which I presume is what chiefly discolours the flax or kills the fish.\n\n\"On the supposition, that the use of boiling water in the preparation of flax may be found to be advantageous and profitable, I can recollect at present but one objection against its being generally adopted. Every flax-grower, it may be said, could not be expected to have conveniences for boiling water sufficient for the purpose; the consumption of water would be great; and some additional expense would be incurred. In answer to this, I shall observe, that I presume any additional expense would be more than reimbursed by the better marketable price of the flax; for otherwise any new improvement, if it will not quit cost must be dropt, were it even the searching after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>. In a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALDRON\">caldron</a> a great deal of flax might be dip in the same water, and the consumption perhaps would not be more than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUART\">quart</a>, to each sheaf. Even a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a> pot would be capable of containing one sheaf after another; and I believe the whole objection would be obviated, were the practice to prevail with us, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, that the flax-grower and the flax-dresser should be two distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a>.\n\n\"I shall conclude with recommending to those who are inclined to make experiments, not to be discouraged by the failure of one or two trials.\u2014Perhaps the flax, instead of being just plunged into the scalding water, ought to be kept in it five minutes, perhaps a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, perhaps a whole hour. Should five minutes or a quarter of an hour, or an hour, not be sufficient to make the boon and harle easily separate, it might perhaps be found expedient to boil the flax for more than an hour; and such boiling when in this state might in return save several hours boiling in the article of bleaching. It is not, I think, at all probable that the boiling of the flax with the boon in it would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> the harle; for in the course of its future existence, it is made to be exposed 20 or 40 times to this boiling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>; and if not detrimental in the one case, it is to be presumed it would not be detrimental in the other. Perhaps after the boiling, it would be proper to pile up the flax in one heap for a whole day, or for half a day, to occasion some fermentation; or perhaps, immediately after the boiling, it might be proper to wash it with cold water. The great object, when the flax is pulled, is to get the harle from the boon with as little loss and damage as possible; and if this is accomplished in a more complete manner than usual, considerable labour and expense will be saved in the future manufacturing of the flax. On this account I think much more would be gained than lost, were the two or three last inches of the roots of the stems to be chopped off, or clipped off previous to the flax being either watered or boiled. When the flax is watered, care should be taken not to spread it out to dry.\"\ndry, when there is a hazard of its being exposed in its wet state to frost.\"\n\nTo what we have now said we shall add the following short account of the flax husbandry of Ireland, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> which appeared in the Farmers Magazine, vol. vii. page 35.\n\n\"Having for several years (says the writer) been engaged in the culture of flax, I devoted a part of last summer to a tour through the manufacturing districts of Ireland. Here that branch of husbandry has long been established over a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the country, and conducted with very considerable success. As some of the processes in this culture, which are followed with advantage, are either unknown to the Scots farmers, or are performed in a very awkward and inefficient manner, it might, I conceive, prove of no small benefit, were some of your intelligent correspondents induced to lay before them a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> sketch of the peculiar management observed by the Irish peasantry in this important article. I am the more desirous it should appear in your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a>, because a periodical work on husbandry, conducted by a practical farmer, appears before the public with manifest advantage, and is received with that sort of deference which is due to experience and authority. The difficulties of actual cultivators regarding the objects of their own profession, however new they may as yet be in the annals of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, are far more likely to prove useful than the writings of those volunteers in this favourite science, who are merely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> and theoretical. I freely confess to you, Sir, that I found with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> your work widely circulated in the sister <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>; and that the cause uniformly given for its popularity, was a degree of confidence placed in the practical skill of its conductor.\n\n\"During my progress through Ireland, the several processes of steeping, drying, and skutching, were in hand, and I think I found a peculiarity of management in these sufficient to affect the success of the whole business, and to confer a decided superiority on the produce of an acre of flax in Ireland over that in Scotland, both in quantity and value. It is no uncommon thing for a farmer in this country, who wishes to make up a sum for his rent, to sell a part of his lint on the foot, as it is termed; and for this he will commonly receive from 30 to 40 guineas per acre.\n\n\"1. The Method of Steeping.\u2014As soon as the crop has attained the proper degree of ripeness, (which is somewhat below your standard of maturity), the flax is pulled, and carried to a stagnant pool, dug for this purpose, moderately deep. It is allowed to remain there only from five to seven days, according to the temperature of the weather. After the fermentation in the steeping process has been carried to a degree sufficient to produce the requisite laxity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIBRE\">fibre</a>, the flax is taken out of the pool, and spread very thinly on the stubble of the hay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a>. There, instead of remaining till it is merely dried, it is continued for three or four weeks, till the grower conceives it ready for skutching. This bleaching process, if I am allowed to call it so, which, in Scotland, is either unknown, or continued merely till the crop is dried, has many advantages; the most obvious one is, that it enables the farmer, every time, to examine it, to ascertain exactly (by rubbing on his hand) the precise point at which the fermentation has arrived, and thus to perceive the tenacity and strength of his flax; while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADHESION\">adhesion</a> of the fibre has been sufficiently weakened, to admit of the skutter cleaning it completely of the woody parts. It is, I am apprehensive, only the practical flax farmer who is able to judge of the importance and delicacy of this part of the husbandry. It is so remarkable, that of two acres of flax, under precisely the same seed and culture, and of equal fertility, it frequently happens that the one shall yield a produce thrice the value of the other, merely from superior accuracy in ascertaining the proper line of continuing the steeping and bleaching processes. In Scotland, therefore, I suspect the practice is faulty and defective; because there the whole process of fermentation is completed by steeping alone; whereas, in Ireland, it is begun only in the steep, and completed by bleaching on the meadow, to that precise point which the safety of the produce requires.\n\n\"2. Smoking and Drying.\u2014The Irish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a> seems to possess another advantage, almost equally decisive, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of drying the flax, before he submits it to the skutter or beater. After the lint has remained a sufficient length of time on the bleaching green, it is gathered up a second time into sheafs, (beats, provincially), and seems tolerably dry. In this state it is deemed by the Scots growers fully prepared for the flax-mill; but far otherwise by the Irish farmer, who never submits it to the hands of the beaters till it has undergone a thorough smoking over a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEAT\">peat</a> fire. For this purpose, he raises, at the back of a ditch, a small hurdle thinly wrought with osiers, and places it on four posts of wood, at the height of four feet above the level of the ground. A pretty strong fire of peats being kindled below, the heat and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> pervade every part of the flax, which is placed perpendicularly above the hurdle. This process is continued, and fresh quantities of flax regularly added, till the whole crop is brought to a state of dryness, which, in this moist climate, can never be effected by the sun and the weather alone: by this operation a degree of brittleness and friability is produced on the flax, which greatly facilitates the ensuing work, and admits of an easy separation of the fibre from the wood. It is evident, that the less friction required in skutching, the less waste or diminution must be occasioned in clearing the flax; and consequently, the greater must be the grower's produce from the mill. This part of the process is equally delicate with that described above, and requires, if possible, still greater attention on the part of the workmen, since it is clear that, by a careless management of the fire, the whole crop may be destroyed.\n\n\"3. Cleaning and Dressing.\u2014The flax husbandry of Ireland derives no small benefit from the application of hand-labour in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> and skutching of lint, thus superfluousing the use of the mill. The most careful and expert workmen are not always able to temper the velocity of machinery so exactly, as to preserve flax that has been oversteeped or bleached to excess: while the steady and regulated impetus of the hand-skutch can easily be modified, as the circumstances of each case may require; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of obvious advantage, because the best flax-mills seldom produce an equal quantity of lint, nor equally clean, with that which is obtained by the hand. Besides this, the price of labour, in this part of the united kingdom, still continues so moderate, as to preclude any considerable degree of saving in expense.\"\npence by the use of machinery. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of this, the flax millers in Scotland, I find, are charging this season from three to four shillings for dressing a stone of flax; while, at the place I am now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, the same quantity is dressed by the hand for threepence, or one British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a>. In Scotland, where hands are scarce, and the price of labour consequently high, I certainly would not recommend the difuse of the flax-mill; on the contrary, I am persuaded that it is chiefly owing to our superior machinery, and excellent implements of husbandry, that we are at all enabled to maintain a competition with our neighbours in the present state of our skill in flax husbandry, and subjected to the disadvantage of paying double price for our labour.\n\n\"4. Preservation of Flax-feed.\u2014The last peculiarity of management, which I shall at present notice as advantageous to the flax husbandry of Ireland, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of a flax barn for the preservation of feed. Enjoying a climate perhaps still more moist and unsteady than that of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, the farmers here were for a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of years, unable to supply themselves with this article, and were obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> feed annually from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> and the Baltic, to supply the increased demands of an extending culture, to the large amount of 200,000l. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>. This annual expenditure of cash long continued to operate as a drain on the stock of the laborious farmer, and prevented the accumulation of his capital; an evil of the most serious magnitude, under which the Irish peasantry still labour, and from which, till very lately, they had not even a prospect of relief. By the practice in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> use, if the farmer stored up his lint in the barn-yard with the rest of his crop in harvest, he might, it is true, preserve his feed; but in doing so, he uniformly lost his flax to a far greater value from overdryness, when wrought in the spring.\n\n\"If, on the other hand, he attempted to separate his feed during the lint harvest by means of the rippling-comb, he had no means of preventing it from being almost invariably destroyed by the wetness of the climate. Various methods had been attempted to overcome this difficulty, but without success; till Robert Tennant, Esq. of Strangmore, linen-inspector, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUNGANNON\">Dungannon</a>, contrived the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of a flax-barn, which seems perfectly competent to the preservation of feed. It has already been erected, and has proved successful on a small scale; the feed cured in it remained during the winter perfectly fresh, and nothing seems wanting to complete this improvement in our flax husbandry, but a larger capital in the hands of a few of our farmers. This flax barn is constructed on wooden potts, roofed on the top, but left perfectly open at each side; it is supplied with various stages of floors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASKET\">basket</a>-work, placed regularly at two feet distance above each other. Thus, the air, having free access to the feed on all sides, preserves it fresh and well-coloured for any length of time.\n\n\"This contrivance was suggested to Mr Tennant, it is said, almost casually, by noticing the great effect produced on cloth, by drying-houses in bleachfields. He had in fact been employed by the Linen Board of Ireland, in teaching the new process of bleaching to the manufacturers, by means of the oxymuriate of lime; and, in the course of seven or eight years, this method of whitening linen has been established over the whole kingdom, with the exception of hardly a single field. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Northland and Mr Foster, who invited this gentleman from Scotland, and patronized him in this part of the kingdom, have enjoyed the satisfaction of beholding a more essential improvement effected in the linen manufacture, in the short space already mentioned, than had ever taken place in a century before.\n\n\"It was my intention, when I began this letter, to have prefaced you a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of a flax <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a>, and to have laid before your readers, a more detailed account of the flax husbandry of Ireland in general. I find, however, that I have already exceeded the ordinary bounds prescribed to the contributors to your useful work; therefore conclude, with expressing a hope, that the few hints already offered, will incline some of your correspondents to treat of a subject certainly of sufficient importance to merit attention. For a branch of husbandry cannot be deemed contemptible, which affords sustenance to upwards of two millions of people; and which, at the same time, adds to the general resources of the empire, no less a sum than seven millions sterling annually. These circumstances, too, I trust, will plead my excuse for holding up a portion of Irish husbandry to the imitation of your numerous readers among the cultivators of Scotland, who are at present justly celebrated for their agricultural knowledge in every part of the world.\"\n\nFlax made to resemble Cotton. In the Swedish Transactions for the year 1747, a method is given of preparing flax in such a manner as to resemble cotton in whiteness and softness, as well as in coherence. For this purpose, a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> water is to be put into an iron pot or an untinned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> kettle, and a mixture of equal parts of birch ashes and quicklime strewed upon it: A small bundle of flax is to be opened and spread upon the surface, and covered with more of the mixture, and the stratification continued till the vessel is sufficiently filled. The whole is then to be boiled with sea water for ten hours; fresh quantities of water being occasionally supplied in proportion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>, that the water may never become dry. The boiled flax is to be immediately washed in the sea by a little at a time, in a basket, with a smooth stick at first while hot; and when grown cold enough to be borne by the hands, it must be well rubbed; washed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>, laid to bleach, and turned and watered every day. Repetitions of the washing with soap expedite the bleaching; after which the flax is to be beaten, and again well washed; when dry it is to be worked and carded in the same manner as common cotton, and pressed between two boards for 48 hours. It is now fully prepared and fit for use. It loses in this process near one half its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, which is abundantly compensated by the improvement made in its quality.\n\nThe filamentous parts of different vegetables have been employed in different countries for the same mechanic uses as hemp and flax among us.

He was the son of Sir Robert Fletcher of Salton and Innerpeffer, and born in the year 1653. The tuition of our author was committed by his father, on his deathbed, to Mr (afterwards Bishop) Burnet, then his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> minister; by whose care he received a pious, learned, and polite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>.

Being cited before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-PRIVY_COUNCIL\">privy <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> and judiciary courts, and not appearing, he was declared traitor, and Fletcher, his estate confiscated.\n\nIn Holland, he and Mr Baillie of Jerviswood were the only persons whom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Argyle consulted concerning the designs which were then in agitation. In 1681 they came over to England, in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> matters with their party in that country; and were the only two who were intrusted to far as to be admitted to the secrets of Lord Ruffell's council of five. Mr Fletcher managed his part of the negotiation with so much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, that administration could find <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> for seizing him; nor could they fix upon him those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> on account of which Mr Baillie was condemned; to whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> let it be remembered, that although offered a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> on condition of his accusing his friend, he persisted in rejecting the proposal with indignation.\n\nMr Fletcher having joined the duke of Monmouth upon his landing, received a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> command under him; but the duke was deprived of his services on the following occasion, as related by Sir John Dalrymple. Being sent upon an expedition, and not Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> esteeming \"times of danger to be times of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>\" and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, he had feigned for his own riding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> of a country <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> [the mayor of Lynne] which stood ready equipped for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, hearing this, ran in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> to Fletcher, gave him opprobrious language, shook his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANE\">cane</a>, and attempted to strike. Fletcher, though rigid in the duties of morality, having been accustomed to foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> both by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, in which he had acquired <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of the honour of a soldier and a gentleman, and of the affront of a cane, pulled out his pistol, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> him dead on the spot. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> was unpopular in countries where such refinements were not understood. A clamour was raised against it among the people of the country; in a body they waited upon the duke with their complaints; and he was forced to desire the only soldier, and almost the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of parts, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, to abandon him. With Fletcher all Monmouth's chance of success in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> left him.\" But, in a manuscript memoir belonging to the family, we have the following notice concerning Mr Fletcher's connection with Monmouth, in which his separation from that prince is very differently accounted for: \"To Lord Marischal Mr Fletcher explained the motives which first induced him to join, and afterwards abandon, the duke of Monmouth. The former he ascribed to the duke's manifesto in Scotland relating to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, and in England to liberty. For the latter he accounted by the dilguit produced in his own mind and that of his associates, when the duke declared himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, and broke <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> with all who embarked with him on his principles. He complained heavily of the account commonly given of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of the mayor of Lynne; and mentioned to Lord Marischal, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the contrary, that he did not leave the duke till he came to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAUNTON\">Taunton</a>, where he was proclaimed king, several weeks after the death of the mayor of Lynne.\"\n\nSeeing all the efforts of himself and his friends in favour of liberty frustrated at Taunton, he endeavoured to secure his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> freedom by taking his passage in the first ship bound to a foreign country. It was his misfortune to land in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>; where he was immediately arrested, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> into prison, and guarded by three\nFletcher, three different bands of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, till a vessel should be prepared to carry him a victim in chains to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. But on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> before the ship could fail, whilst he looked pensive through the bars that secured the window of his room, he was hailed by a venerable personage who made signs to speak with him. The prison doors he found open; and whilst his friendly conductor waved to him to follow him, he passed through three different guards of soldiers all fast asleep. Without being permitted to offer his thanks to his deliverer, he found himself obliged to prosecute with all speed the journey, in which he was directed by a person concerning whom he could never collect any information; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> he proceeded in safety through Spain. He felt a peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> in relating to his friends instances of the care of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a> which he had experienced during his exile; and entertained them often with narratives of this kind, which he always mingled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> reflections. Of these, another may be here mentioned. Happening in the evening to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> the skirt of a wood at a few miles distance from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> where he intended to lodge, he came to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> met. After he had entered upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, he was accosted by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> of a respectable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, who warned him to turn back, and take the road on the left; for that in the other there was danger which he could not escape <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to proceed. His friendly monitor suddenly retired into the wood, out of which he had issued no less unexpectedly. Having arrived at the city, the inhabitants were soon after alarmed by an account of the robbery and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> of several travellers who that evening had fallen into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of a banditti upon the very way in which he had intended to travel. From these and other instances of preservation from dangers, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a> of his mind, habituated from his infancy to an intercourse with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, led him to conclude that he was in a peculiar manner the care of Providence, and that in critical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> his understanding received its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> from a supernatural impulse.\n\nDuring his exile, he maintained a frequent and extensive correspondence with the friends of liberty at home; and he partly employed himself in making a curious collection of books, which compose the best private library in Scotland. But his genius also prompted him to engage in more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> employments. He repaired to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUNGARY\">Hungary</a>, and served several campaigns as a volunteer under the duke of Lorraine with great reputation. At length, understanding that the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> then projecting in Holland, and upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> of which he considered the liberties of Britain to be suspended, had attained a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of maturity, he hastened thither; where his councils and addresses were of eminent service. He came over with King William; and in zeal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>, penetration, and political skill, proved inferior to none of the leaders in the Revolution.\n\nSuch, however, was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a>, that from a survey of King William's papers it appears, that while others laboured to turn this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> event to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a> of themselves and the aggrandisement of their family, Mr Fletcher asked nothing. His estate had been forfeited, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> abandoned to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a>; his fortune was greatly shattered, and his family reduced to circumstances of distress. Nothing was given him in recompense of all his sufferings. On the contrary, he, together with the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a>, was distinguished by marks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> and ministerial dislike. Still, whatever private resentment he might entertain, it appeared that his ruling principle was the good of his country; and that to this grand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his heart he was willing to sacrifice all personal considerations. For when, in 1692, the abdicated king meditated an invasion, Mr Fletcher addressed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> (preserved in Sir John Dalrymple's collection) to the duke of Hamilton, in which every argument is employed with skill and energy to engage his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> to forget his injuries, and in the present crisis to employ the extensive influence and authority he then possessed in the cause of freedom and of his country. This letter produced its full effect; and the duke returned to his duty, from which he had in part begun to deviate.\n\nTo follow our author through all the mazes of his political <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> subsequent to the Revolution, is beyond our purpose, and would exceed our limits. One or two circumstances more shall therefore suffice. Being elected a member for the parliament 1683, he showed an uniform zeal for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of his country. The thought of England's domineering over Scotland was what his generous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> could not endure. The indignities and opprobrium which Scotland lay under galled him to the heart; so that in his learned and elaborate discourses, he exposed them with undaunted courage and pathetic eloquence. In that great event, the Union, he performed essential service. He got the act of security passed, which declared that the two crowns should not pass to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> till Scotland was secured in her liberties civil and religious. Therefore Lord Godolphin was forced into the Union, to avoid a civil war after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMISE\">demise</a>. Although Mr Fletcher disapproved of some of the articles, and indeed of the whole frame of the Union; yet, as the act of security was his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, he had all the merit of that important transaction.\n\nWe must not omit mentioning, that in the ardour of his political <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> Mr Fletcher forgot not the interests of the place that gave him birth. He esteemed the education of youth one of the noblest objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. On this subject he wrote a treatise, still extant, most characteristic of himself; and he established at Salton a foundation for the same purpose, of great utility while it lasted.\n\nThis great man died at London 1716, aged 66. His remains were conveyed to Scotland, and deposited in the family vault at Salton.\n\nThat Mr Fletcher received neither honours nor emoluments from King William, may perhaps be in part attributed to himself; a circumstance, however, which must add greatly to the lustre of his character. His uncomplying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, and the firmness of his principles, were ill calculated to conciliate courtly favour. He was so zealous an adherent of the liberties of the people, that he was too jealous of the growing power of all princes; in whom he thought ambition so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a>, that he was not for trusting the best of kings with the power which ill ones might make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of against their subjects; he was of opinion that all princes were made by, and for the benefit of, the people; and that they should have no power but that of doing good. This, which\nwhich made him oppose King Charles and invade King James, led him also to oppose the giving so much power to King William, whom he would never serve after his establishment. So we are told by the author of Short Political <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">Characters</a>, a M.S. in the library of the late T. Rawlinson, Esq.\u2014Mr Lockhart, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a>, p. 72, expresses a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> that his aversion to the English and to the Union was so great, that, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> to them, he was inclined to side with the abdicated family: \u201cBut (adds he) as that was a subject not fit to be entered upon with him, this is only a conjecture from some inuendos I have heard him make; but so far is certain, he liked, commended, and conversed with high-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> Torics, more than any other set of men; acknowledging them to be the best countrymen, and of most honour, integrity, and ingenuity.\u201d It seems difficult to reconcile this with Mr Fletcher\u2019s avowed principles and the general tenor of his conduct. May we suppose, that, chagrining, if not at the neglect or the ill treatment which he had himself received from government since the Revolution, yet at the public measures relating to his native country, might have occasioned him to relent in his sentiments with regard to the exiled family?\u2014In the family memoirs already quoted, we are informed, That \u201cLord Marischal held Mr Fletcher\u2019s character in high admiration;\u201d and that, \u201cwhen governor of Neufchatel, where Rousseau resided about the year 1766, he prevailed with this very extraordinary genius to write the life of a man whose character and actions he wished to have transmitted to posterity with advantage. For this purpose, his lordship applied to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> relation of Mr Fletcher\u2019s for materials; which by him were transmitted to Lord Marischal; but the design failed through Rousseau\u2019s deftly and capricious disposition.\u201d This anecdote must appear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with the known loyalty and attachments of the Earl Marischal, unless we suppose him to have been privy to some such sentiments of Mr Fletcher as those alluded to by Mr Lockhart; for how could we suppose him anxious to promote a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, in which the task would be to celebrate principles diametrically opposite to his own, and to applaud actions subversive of that royal family in whose cause he had ventured his life, and forfeited his fortune, and foregone his country!\u2014But however these circumstances may be reconciled, as the integrity, disinterestedness, and public spirit of Mr Fletcher, have been universally acknowledged, there is reason to believe, that all his sentiments and actions were founded in honour, and that he never once pursued a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> rather than he judged it to be for the interest of his country.\n\nMr Fletcher was master of the English, Latin, Greek, French, and Italian languages; and well versed in history, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CIVIL_LAW\">civil law</a>, and all kinds of learning. In his travels, he had not only acquired considerable knowledge in the art of war, but also became versant in the respective interests of the several princes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. In private life, he was affable to his friends, and free from all manner of vice. He had a penetrating, clear, and lively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>; but is said to have been too much wedded to opinions, and impatient of contradiction.\u2014He possessed an uncommon elevation of mind, accompanied with a warmth of temper, which would suffer him to brook from no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> among men, nor in any place, an indignity. Of this Fletcherwood he exhibited a singular proof in the Scots parliament. The earl of Stair, secretary of state and minister for Scotland, having in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of debate used an improper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> against Mr Fletcher, he seized him by his robe, and inflicted upon public and immediate satisfaction. His lordship was obliged instantly to beg his pardon in presence of parliament.\n\nMr Fletcher was by far the finest speaker in the parliament of Scotland; the earl of Stair alone rivalled him. The latter was famed for a splendid, the former for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> and nervous, eloquence. He formed his style on the models of antiquity; and the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of his works, Sir John Dalrymple observes, though imperfectly collected, is one of the very few classical compositions in the English language.","sp":302,"ep":305},{"h":"FLETWOOD","t":"WILLIAM, an eminent English lawyer and recorder of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>.

It is known to every seaman, of what vast moment it is to ascertain the stability of such vessels, and the positions they assume when they float freely on the surface of the water. To be able to accomplish this, it is necessary to understand the principles on which that stability and these positions depend. This has been done with great ingenuity by Mr Atwood, of whose reasoning the following is a summary account, taken from the Philosophical Transactions for 1796.\n\nA floating body is pressed downwards by its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> in a vertical line passing through its centre of gravity; and it is supported by the upward pressure of a fluid, which acts in a vertical line that passes through the centre of gravity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> which is under the water;\nFloating Bodies.\n\nwater; and without a coincidence between these two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, in such a manner as that both centres of gravity may be in the same vertical line, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> turn on an axis, till it gains a position in which the equilibrium of floating will be permanent. From this it is obviously necessary to find what proportion the part immersed bears to the whole, to do which the specific gravity of the floating body must be known, after which it must be found by geometrical methods, in what positions the solid can be placed on the surface of the fluid, so that both centres of gravity may be in the same vertical line, when any given part of the solid is immersed under the surface. These things being determined, something is still wanting, for positions may be assumed in which the circumstances now mentioned concur, and yet the solid will assume some other position wherein it will permanently float. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the specific gravity of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> be to that of the fluid on which it floats as 3 to 4, and its axis to the diameter of the base as 2 to 1; if it be placed on the fluid with its axis vertical, it will sink to a depth equal to a diameter and a half of the base; and while its axis is preserved in a vertical position by outward force, the centres of gravity of the whole solid and immersed part will remain in the same vertical line; but when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> force is removed, it will deviate from its upright position, and will permanently float with its axis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a>. If we suppose the axis to be half the diameter of the base, and placed vertically, the solid will sink to the depth of three-eighths of its diameter, and in that position it will float permanently. If the axis be made to incline to the vertical line, the solid will change its position till it permanently settles with its axis perpendicular to the horizon.\n\nWhether a solid floats permanently, or overflows when placed on the surface of a fluid, provided the centre of gravity of the solid and that of the immersed part be in the same vertical line, it is said to be in a position of equilibrium, of which there are three kinds; the equilibrium of stability, in which the solid permanently floats in a given position; the equilibrium of instability, in which the solid spontaneously overflows, if not supported by external force; and the equilibrium of indifference, or the insensible equilibrium, in which the solid rests on the fluid indifferent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, without tendency to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> itself when inclined, or to incline farther.\n\nIf a solid body floats permanently on the surface of a fluid, and external force be applied to turn it from its position, the resistance opposed to this inclination is termed the stability of floating. Some ships at sea yield to a given impulse of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, and suffer a greater inclination from the perpendicular than others. As this resistance to heeling, duly regulated, has been considered of importance in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of vessels, many eminent mathematicians have laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> rules for ascertaining the stability of ships from their known dimensions and weight, without recurring to actual experiment. Bouguer, Euler, Chapman, and others, have laid down theorems for this purpose, founded on the supposition that the inclinations of ships from their quiescent positions are evanescent, or very small in a practical point of view. But ships at sea have been found to heel 10\u00b0, 25\u00b0, or 30\u00b0, and therefore it may be doubted how far such rules are applicable in practice. If <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATICS\">statics</a> can be applied to naval <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, it seems necessary that the rules should be extended to those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> of inclination are of any magnitude, likely to occur in the practice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>. A solid body placed on the surface of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> fluid, at such a depth as corresponds to the relative gravities, cannot alter its position by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of its own weight and the pressure of the fluid, except by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> on some horizontal axis passing through the centre of gravity; but, as many axes may be drawn through this point of the floating body, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the horizon, and the motion of the solid regards only one axis, this must be determined by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of the body and the particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. When this axis of motion is ascertained, and the specific gravity of the solid found, the positions of permanent floating will be determined, by finding the several positions of equilibrium through which the solid may be conceived to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>, while it turns round the axis of motion; and by determining in which of these positions the equilibrium is permanent, and in which of them it is momentary.\n\nThe whole of Mr Atwood's valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> relates to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of naval architecture, in so far as it is dependent on the laws of pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>. If the proportions and dimensions adopted in the construction of individual vessels are obtained by exact geometrical measurement, and observations are made on the performance of these vessels at sea; a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of experiments of this nature judiciously varied, are the proper grounds on which theory may be effectually applied, in reducing to system those hitherto unperceived causes, which contribute to give the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of excellence to vessels of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. Naval architecture being reckoned among the practical branches of science, every voyage may be viewed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of an experiment, from which useful truths are to be deduced. But inferences of this nature cannot well be obtained, except by acquiring a thorough knowledge of all the proportions and dimensions of each part of the ship, and by making a sufficient number of observations on the qualities of the vessel, in all the varieties of situation to which a ship is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> subject in the practice of navigation.\n\nThe following is an ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of the same subject by Mr English, which we give in his own words.\n\n\"However operose and difficult (says he) the calculations necessary to determine the stability of nautical vessels may, in some cases, be, yet they all depend, says this author, upon the four following simple and obvious theorems, accompanied with other well known stereometrical and statical principles.\n\n\"Theorem 1. Every floating body displaces a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of the fluid in which it floats, equal to its own weight; and consequently, the specific gravity of the fluid will be to that of the floating body, as the magnitude of the whole is to that of the part immersed.\n\n\"Theorem 2. Every floating body is impelled downward by its own essential power, acting in the direction of a vertical line passing through the centre of gravity of the whole; and is impelled upward by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REACTION\">reaction</a> of the fluid which supports it, acting in the direction of a vertical line passing through the centre of gravity of the part immersed; therefore, unless these two lines are coincident, the floating body thus impelled must revolve round an axis, either in motion or at rest, until the equilibrium is restored.\n\n\"Theorem 3. If by any power whatever a vessel be deflected...\"\ndeflected from an upright position, the perpendicular distance between two vertical lines passing through the centres of gravity of the whole, and of the part immersed respectively, will be as the stability of the vessel, and which will be positive, nothing, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>, according as the metacentre is above, coincident with, or below, the centre of gravity of the vessel.\n\n\"Theorem 4. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> centre of gravity of any system of bodies being given in position, if any one of these bodies be moved from one part of the system to another, the corresponding motion of the common centre of gravity, estimated in any given direction, will be to that of the aforementioned body, estimated in the same direction, as the weight of the body moved is to that of the whole system.\n\n\"From whence it is evident, that in order to ascertain the stability of any vessel, the position of the centres of gravity of the whole, and of that part immersed, must be determined; with which, and the dimensions of the vessel, the line of floatation, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of deflection, the stability or power either to right itself or overturn, may be found.\n\n\"In ships of war and merchandise, the calculations necessary for the purpose become unavoidably very perplexing and troublesome; but they may be much facilitated by the experimental method pointed out in the New Transactions of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the year 1787, page 48.\n\n\"In river and canal boats, the regularity and simplicity of the form of the vessel itself, together with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> disposition and homogeneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the burden, render that method for them unnecessary, and make the requisite calculations become very easy. Vessels of this kind are generally of the same transverse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> throughout their whole length, except a small part in prow and stern, formed by segments of circles or other simple curves; therefore a length may easily be assigned such, that any of the transverse sections being multiplied thereby, the product will be equal to the whole solidity of the vessel. The form of the section ABCD is for the most part either rectangular, as in fig. 1. Plate CCXVIII., trapezoidal as in fig. 2, or mixtilinear as in fig. 3, in all which MM represents the line of floatation when upright, and EF that when inclined at any angle MXE; also G represents the centre of gravity of the whole vessel, and R that of the part immersed.\n\n\"If the vessel be loaded quite up to the line <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a>, and the specific gravity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> and burden be the same, then the point G is simply the centre of gravity of the section ABCD; but if not, the centres of gravity of the boat and burden must be found separately, and reduced to one by the common method, namely, by dividing the sum of the momenta by the sum of weights, or areas, which in this case are as the weights. The point R is always the centre of gravity of the section MMCD, which, if consisting of different figures, must also be found by dividing the sum of the momenta by the sum of the weights as common. These two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> being found, the next thing necessary is to determine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of the two equal triangles MXE, M XF, their centres of gravity o, o, and the perpendicular projected distance n n of these points on the water line EF. This being done, through R and parallel to EF draw RT = a fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the whole area MMCD, either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> MXE or M XF, and the distance n n; through T, and at right angles to RT or EF, draw TS meeting the vertical axis of the vessel in S the metacentre; also through the points G, B, and parallel to ST, draw NGW and BV; moreover through S, and parallel to EF, draw WSV, meeting the two former in V and W; then SW is as the stability of the vessel, which will be positive, nothing, or negative, according as the point S is above, coincident with, or below, the point G. If now we suppose W to represent the weight of the whole vessel and burden (which will be equal to the section MMCD multiplied by the length of the vessel), and P to represent the required weight applied at the gunwale B to sustain the vessel at the given angle or inclination; we shall always have this proportion: as VS : SW :: W : P; which proportion is general, whether SW be positive or negative; it must only in the latter case be supposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> upward to prevent an overturn.\n\n\"In the rectangular vessel, of given weight and dimensions, the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> is so evident, that any farther explanation would be unnecessary. In the trapezoidal vessel, after having found the points G and R, let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">AD</a>, BC be produced until they meet in K. Then, since the two sections MMCD, EFDC are equal; the two triangles MMK, EFK are also equal; and therefore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTANGLE\">rectangle</a> EK \u00d7 KF = KM \u00d7 KM = KM\u00b2; and since the angle of inclination is supposed to be known, the angles at E and F are given. Consequently, if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> proportional be found between the sines of the angle at E and F, we shall have the following proportions:\n\n\"As the mean proportional thus found: fine \u2220E :: KM : KF, and in the said mean proportional: fine \u2220F :: KM : KE; therefore ME, MF become known; from whence the area of either triangle MXE or M XF, the distance n n, and all the other requisites, may be found.\n\n\"In the mixtilinear section, let AB = 9 feet = 108 inches, the whole depth = 6 feet = 72 inches, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> of MM the line of floatation 4 feet or 48 inches; also let the two curvilinear parts be circular quadrants of two feet, or 24 inches radius each. Then the area of the two quadrants = 904.7808 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> inches, and the distance of their centres of gravity from the bottom = 13.8177 inches very nearly; also the area of the included rectangle abie = 1440 square inches, and the altitude of its centre of gravity 12 inches; in like manner, the area of the rectangle ABCD will be found = 5184 square inches, and the altitude of its centre of gravity 48 inches: therefore we shall have\n\nMomentum of the two quadrants = 904.7808 \u00d7 13.8177 = 12501.9896016\n\nMoment of the rectangle abie = 1440 \u00d7 12 = 17280\n\nMoment of the rectangle ABCD = 5184 \u00d7 48 = 248832\n\nNow the sum of the momenta, divided by the sum of the areas, will give \\(\\frac{2786139896016}{75287808} = 37006\\) inches, the altitude of G, the centre of gravity of the section.\nFloating section ABCD above the bottom. In like manner, Bodies the altitude of R, the centre of gravity of the section Flooding, MMCD, will be found to be equal\n\n\\[ \\frac{12309378966016}{49367808} = 24'934 \\text{ inches; and consequently their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>, or the value of GR } = 12'072 \\text{ inches, will be found.} \\]\n\nSuppose the vessel to heel 15\u00b0, and we shall have the following proportion; namely, As radius : tangent of 15\u00b0 :: MX = 54 inches : 14'469 inches = ME or MF; and consequently the area of either triangle MXE or MXF = 39\u00b0663 square inches. Therefore, by theorem 4th, as 49367808 : 39\u00b0663 :: 72 = n = \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) AB : 5'6975 inches = RT; and, again, as radius: fine of 15\u00b0 :: 12'072 = GR : 3'1245 inches = RN; consequently RT - RN = 5'6975 - 3'1245 = 2'573 inches = SW, the stability required.\n\nMoreover, as the fine of 15\u00b0 : radius :: 5'6975 = RT : 22'013 = RS, to which, if we add 24'934, the altitude of the point R, we shall have 46'947 for the height of the metacentre, which taken from 72, the whole altitude, there remains 25'033; from which, and the half width = 54 inches, the distance BS is found = 59'529 inches very nearly, and the angle SBV = 80\u00b0 - 56' - 4'2\"; from whence SV = 58'645 inches.\n\nAgain: Let us suppose the mean length of the vessel to be 40 feet, or 480 inches, and we shall have the weight of the whole vessel equal to the area of the section MMCD = 49367808 multiplied by 480 = 2360654784 cubic inches of water, which weighs exactly 85708 pounds avoirdupois, allowing the cubic foot to weigh 62.5 pounds.\n\nAnd, finally, as SV : SW (i.e.) as 58'645 : 2'573 :: 85708 : 3760 + , the weight on the gunwale which will sustain the vessel at the given inclination. Therefore a vessel of the above dimensions, and weighing 38 tons 5 cwt. 28 lbs. will require a weight of 1 ton 13 cwt. 64 lbs. to make her incline 15\u00b0.\n\nIn this example the deflecting power has been supposed to act perpendicularly on the gunwale at B; but if the vessel is navigated by sails, the centre velique must be found; with which and the angle of deflection, the projected distance thereof on the line SV may be obtained; and then the power calculated as above, necessary to be applied at the projected point, will be that part of the wind's force which causes the vessel to heel. And conversely, if the weight and dimensions of the vessel, the area and altitude of the sails, the direction and velocity of the wind be given, the angle of deflection may be found.*\n\n* Phil.

Yet they generally rough-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> their boards for the flooring before they begin any thing else about the building, that they may let them by to dry and season, which is done in the most careful manner. The best wood for flooring is the fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> well seasoned, which when well laid, will keep its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> while; whereas the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> sort becomes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> by often washing, and looks very bad. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> of the boards are commonly made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, so as to touch each other only; but, when the fluff is not quite dry, and the boards shrink, the water runs through them whenever the floor is walked, and injures the ceiling underneath. For this reason they are made with feather edges, so as to cover each other about half an inch, and sometimes they are made with grooves and tenons; and sometimes the joints are made with dove tails; in which case the lower edge is nailed down, and the next drove into it, so that the nails are concealed. The manner of measuring floors is by squares of 10 feet on each side, so that taking the length and breadth, and multiplying them together and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> off two decimals, the content of a floor in square will be given. Thus 18 by 16 gives 288 or 2 squares and 88 decimal parts.\n\nEarthen Floors, are commonly made of loam, and sometimes, especially to make malt on, of lime, and brook <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUN\">gun</a> dust, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANVIL\">anvil</a> dust from the forge.\n\nOx blood and fine clay, tempered together, Sir Hugh Plat says, make the finest floor in the world.\n\nThe manner of making earthen floors for plain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> habitations is as follows: Take two-thirds of lime, and one of coal ashes well fitted, with a small quantity of loam clay; mix the whole together, and temper it well with water, making it up into a heap: let it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> or ten days, and then temper it over again. After this, heap it up for three or four days, and repeat the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERING\">tempering</a> very high, till it become smooth, yielding, tough, and gluey.

His reason is, that Varro, in his fourth book of the Latin tongue, ranks Flora among the deities to whom Tatius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of the Sabines offered up vows before he joined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>.

Towards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PISA\">Pisa</a>, there is a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of 40 miles in length; which is so filled with villages and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> houses, that they seem to be a continuation of the suburbs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>. Independent of the churches and palaces of Florence, most of which are very magnificent, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> of the houses in general is in a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>; and the streets are remarkably clean, and paved with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> chiseled so as to prevent the horses from sliding. The city is divided into two unequal parts by the river Arno, over which there are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less than four bridges in sight of each other. That called the Ponte della Trinit\u00e0, which is uncommonly elegant, is built entirely of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> marble, and ornamented with four beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> representing the Seasons. The quays, the buildings on each side, and the bridges, render that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Florence through which the river runs by far the finest. Every corner of this beautiful city is full of wonders in the arts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATUARY\">statuary</a>, and architecture. The streets, squares, and fronts of the palaces, are adorned with a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of statues; some of them by the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> masters, Michael Angelo, Bandinelli, Donatello, Giovanni di <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>, Benvenuto Cellini, and others. Some of the Florentine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> formerly were men of vast wealth, and lived in a most magnificent manner. One of them, about the middle of the fifteenth century, built that noble fabric, which, from the name of its founder, is still called the Palazzo Pitti. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> was ruined by the prodigious expense of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, which was immediately purchased by the Medici <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> ever since to be the residence of the sovereigns. The gardens belonging to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> are on the declivity of an eminence. On the summit there is a kind of fort, called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELVEDERE\">Belvedere</a>. From this, and from some of the higher walks, you have a complete view of the city of Florence, and the beauteous vale of Arno, in the middle of which it stands. This palace has been enlarged since it was purchased from the ruined family of Pitti. The furniture is rich and curious, particularly some tables of Florentine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, which are much admired. The most precious ornaments, however, are the paintings. The walls of what is called the Imperial Chamber, are painted in fresco, by various painters; the subjects are allegorical, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of Lorenzo of Medicis distinguished.\nFlorence, distinguished by the name of the Magnificent. The famous gallery attracts every stranger. One of the most interesting parts of it, in the eyes of many, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of Roman emperors, from Julius Caesar to Gallienus, with a considerable number of their empresses, arranged opposite to them. This series is almost complete; but wherever the bust of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> is wanting, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> is filled up by that of some other distinguished Roman. The celebrated Venus of Medici, which has been removed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, is thought to be the standard of taste in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and proportion, and stood formerly in a room called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">Tribunal</a>. The inscription on its base mentions its being made by Cleomenesian Athenian, the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOLLODORUS\">Apollodorus</a>. It is of white marble, and surrounded by other masterpieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>, some of which are said to be the works of Praxiteles and other Greek masters. In the same room are many valuable curiosities, besides a collection of admirable pictures by the best masters. There are various other rooms, whose contents are indicated by the names they bear; as, the Cabinet of Arts, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a>, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>, of Medals, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORCELAIN\">Porcelain</a>, of Antiquities; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALOON\">Saloon</a> of the Hermaphrodite, so called from a statue which divides the admiration of the amateurs with that in the Borghese villa at Rome, though the excellence of the execution is disfigured by the vileness of the subject; and the Gallery of Portraits, which contains the portraits of the most eminent painters (all executed by themselves) who have flourished in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> during the three last centuries. Our limits <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not admit of a detail of the hundredth part of the curiosities and buildings of Florence. We must not however omit mentioning the chapel of St Lorenzo, as being perhaps the finest and most expensive habitation that ever was reared for the dead; it is incrusted with precious stones, and adorned by the workmanship of the best modern sculptors. Mr Addison remarked, that this chapel advanced so slowly, that it is not impossible that the family of Medici may be extinct before their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURIAL\">burial</a> place is finished. This has actually taken place: the Medici family is extinct, and the chapel remains still unfinished.\n\nFlorence is a place of some strength, and contains an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a>'s see and an university. The number of inhabitants is calculated at 80,000. They boast of the improvements they have made in the Italian tongue, by means of their Academia della Crusca; and several other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">academies</a> are now established at Florence. Though the Florentines affect great state, yet their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> and gentry drive a retail trade in wine, which they sell from their cellar windows, and sometimes they even hang out a broken flask, as a sign where it may be bought. They <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a>, besides wine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> and silver stuffs. The Jews are not held in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of odium, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> subjected to the same humiliating distinctions here, as in most other cities of Europe; and it is said that some of the richest merchants are of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>.\n\nAs to the manners and amusements of the inhabitants, Dr Moore informs us, that \"besides the conversations which they have here, as in other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> of Italy, a number of the nobility meet every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> called the Cafino. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> is pretty much on the same footing with the clubs in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. The members are elected by ballot. They meet at no particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, but go at any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that is convenient. They play at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILLIARDS\">billiards</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDS\">cards</a>, and other games, or continue conversing the whole evening, as they think proper. They are served with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>, coffee, lemonade, ices, or what other refreshments they choose; and each person pays for what he calls for. There is one material <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between this and the English clubs, that women as well as men are members. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of both sexes behave with more frankness and familiarity to strangers as well as to each other, than is customary in public assemblies in other parts of Italy. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">opera</a> is a place where the people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> pay and receive visits, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> as freely as at the Cafino above mentioned. This occasions a continual passing and repassing to and from the boxes, except in those where there is a party of cards formed; it is then looked on as a piece of ill manners to disturb the players. From this it may be guessed, that here, as in some other towns in Italy, little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> is paid to the music by the company in the boxes, except at a new opera, or during some favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. But the dancers command a general attention: as soon as they begin, conversation ceases; even the card-players lay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> their cards, and fix their eyes on the ballette. Yet the excellence of Italian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a> seems to consist in feats of strength, and a kind of jerking agility, more than in graceful movement. There is a continual contest among the performers, who shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> highest. You see here none of the sprightly alluring gaiety of the French comic dancers, or of the graceful attitudes and smooth flowing motions of the performers in the serious opera at Paris. It is surprising that a people of such taste and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> as the Italians, should prefer a parcel of athletic jumpers to elegant dancers. On the evenings on which there is no opera, it is usual for the genteel company to drive to a public walk immediately without the city, where they remain till it begins to grow dark.\"\n\nE. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">Long</a>. 12. 24.

It was first discovered, in 1497, by Sebastian Cabot, a Venetian, then in the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>; whence a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> was claimed by the kings of England; and this province, as well as Georgia, was included in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a> granted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> II. to Carolina.\nIn 1512, however, Florida was more fully discovered by Ponce de Leon, an able Spanish navigator, but who undertook his voyage from the most absurd motives that can be well imagined. The Indians of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARIBBEE_ISLANDS\">Caribbee <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> had among them a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>, that somewhene on the continent there was a fountain whose waters had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of restoring youth to all old men who tasted them. The romantic imaginations of the Spaniards were delighted with this idea. Many embarked in voyages to find out this imaginary fountain, who were never afterwards heard of. Their superstitious countrymen never imagined that these people had perished. They concluded that they did not return, only because they had drunk of the immortalizing liquor, and had discovered a spot so delightful, that they did not choose to leave it. Ponce de Leon set out with this extravagant view as well as others, and fully persuaded of the existence of a third world, the conquest of which was to immortalize his name. In the attempt to discover this country, he rediscovered Florida; but returned to the place from whence he came, visibly more advanced in years than when he set out.\n\nFor some time this country was neglected by the Spaniards, and some Frenchmen settled in it. But the new colony being neglected by the ministry, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> II. of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> having accustomed himself to think that he was the sole proprietor of America, fitted out a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CADIZ\">Cadiz</a> to destroy them. His orders were executed with barbarity. The French intrenchments were forced, and most of the people killed. The prisoners were hanged on trees; with this inscription, \"Not as Frenchmen, but as Heretics.\"\n\nThis cruelty was soon after revenged by Dominie de Gourgues, a skilful and intrepid seaman of Gascony, an enemy to the Spaniards, and passionately fond of hazardous expeditions and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>. He held his estate; built some ships; and with a select band of adventurers like himself embarked for Florida. He drove the Spaniards from all their posts with incredible valour and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>; defeated them in every encounter; and by way of retaliation, hung the prisoners on trees, with this inscription, \"Not as Spaniards, but as Assassins.\" This expedition was attended with no other consequences; Gourgues blew up the forts he had taken, and returned home, where no notice was taken of him. It was conquered in 1539 by the Spaniards under Ferdinand de Soto, not without a great deal of bloodshed; as the natives were very warlike and made a vigorous resistance. The settlement, however, was not fully established till the year 1565; when the town of St Augustine, the capital of the colony while it remained in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the Spaniards, was founded. In 1586, this place was taken and pillaged by Sir Francis Drake. It met with the same fate in 1665, being taken and plundered by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Davis and a body of buccaneers. In 1702, an attempt was made upon it by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> More, governor of Carolina. He set out with 500 English and 700 Indians; and having reached St Augustine, he besieged it for three months; at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> of which, the Spaniards having sent some ships to the relief of the place, he was obliged to retire.

They do vast mischief among magazines of flour laid up for armies and other public uses.

The way to prevent their breeding in the flour, is to preserve it from damp: nothing gets more injury by being put up damp than flour; and yet nothing is more frequently put up so. It should be always carefully and thoroughly dried before it is put up, and the barrels also dried into which it is to be put; then, if they are placed in a room tolerably warm and dry, they will keep it well.

See the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">Colour</a> (of Plants).\n\nColours extracted from Flowers. See Colour-Making.\n\nPreserving of Flowers. The method of preserving flowers in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> through the whole year has been much sought after by many people. Some have attempted it by gathering them when dry and not too much opened, and burying them in dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>; but this, though it preserves their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> well, takes off from the liveliness of their colour. Muntingius prefers the following method to all others. Gather roses, or other flowers, when they are not yet thoroughly open, in the middle of a dry day; fill the vessel up to the top with them; and when full sprinkle them over with some good French wine, with a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> in it; then set them by in a cellar, tying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the mouth of the pot. After this they may be taken out at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>; and, on setting them in the sun, or within reach of the fire, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> open as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> growing naturally; and not only the colour, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> also will be preserved.\n\nThe flowers of plants are by much the most difficult parts of them to preserve in any tolerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of perfection; of which we have instances in all the collections of dried plants, or horti seci. In these the leaves, stalks, roots, and seeds of the plants, appear very well preserved; the strong texture of these parts making them always retain their natural form, and the colours in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> naturally remaining. But where these fade, the plant is little the worse for us as to the knowing the species by it. But it is very much otherwise in regard to flowers; these are naturally by much the most beautiful parts of the plants to which they belong; but they are so much injured in the common way of drying, that they not only lose, but change their colours one into another, by which means they give a handle to many errors; and they usually also wither up, so as to lose their very form and natural shape. The primrose and cowslip kinds are very eminent instances of the change of colours in the flowers of dried specimens; for those of these clasps plants easily dry in their natural shape; but they lose their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, and, instead of it, acquire a fine green colour, much superior to that of the leaves in their most perfect state. The flowers of all the violet kind lose their beautiful blue, and become of a dead <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>: so that in dried specimens there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the blue-flowered violet and the white-flowered kinds.\n\nSir Robert Southwell has communicated to the world a method of drying plants, by which this defect is proposed to be in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> remedied, and all flowers preserved in their natural shape, and many in their natural colours.\u2014For this purpose two plates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> are to be prepared of the size of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> half sheet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, or larger, for particular occasions; these plates must be made so thick as not to be apt to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a>; and there must be a hole made near every corner for the receiving a screw to fasten them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> together. When these plates are prepared, lay in readiness several sheets of paper, and then gather the plants with their flowers when they are quite perfect. Let this be always done in the middle of a dry day; and then lay the plant and its flower on one of the sheets of paper doubled in half, spreading out all the leaves and petals as nicely as possible. If the stalk is thick, it must be pared or cut in half, so that it may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> flat; and if it is woody, it may be peeled, and only the bark left. When the plant is thus expanded, lay round about it some loose leaves and petals of the flower, which may serve to complete any part that is deficient. When all is thus prepared, lay several sheets of paper over the plant, and as many under it; then put the whole between the iron plates, laying the papers smoothly on one, and laying the other evenly over them; screw them close, and put them into an oven after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> is drawn, and let them lie there two hours. After that, make a mixture of equal parts of aquafortis and common brandy; shake these well together, and when the flowers are taken out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> of the plates, rub them lightly over with a camel's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> dipped in this liquor; then lay them upon fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> paper, and covering them with some other sheets, press them between this and other papers with a handkerchief till the\nFlower, the wet of these liquors is dried wholly away. When Flowering, the plant is thus far prepared, take the bulk of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUTMEG\">nutmeg</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> dragon; put this into a pint of fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, and let it stand 24 hours; it will in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> be wholly dissolved; then dip a fine hair pencil in this liquor, and with it daub over the back sides of the leaves, and lay them carefully down on half a sheet of white paper fairly expanded, and press them down with some more papers over them. When the gum-water is fixed, let the presser and papers be removed, and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> is finished. The leaves retain their verdure in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, and the flowers usually keep their natural colours. Some care, however, must be taken, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the oven be not too great. When the flowers are thick and bulky, some art may be used to pare off their backs, and dispose the petals in a due order; and after this, if any of them are wanting, their places may be supplied with some of the superfluous ones dried on purpose; and if any of them are only faded, it will be prudent to take them away, and lay down others in their stead: the leaves may be also disposed and mended in the same manner.\n\nAnother method of preserving both flowers and fruit found throughout the whole year is also given by the same author. Take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALTPETRE\">saltpetre</a>, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>; Armenian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOLE\">bole</a>, two pounds; clean common sand, three pounds; mix all well together. Then gather fruit of any kind that is not fully ripe, with the stalk to each; put these in, one by one, into a wide-mouthed glass, laying them in good order. Tie over the top with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>-cloth, and carry them into a dry cellar, and set the whole upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of the prepared <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of four inches thick in a box. Fill up the remainder of the box with the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>; and let it be four inches thick all over the top of the glass, and all round its sides. Flowers are to be preserved in the same sort of glasses, and in the same manner; and they may be taken up after a whole year as plump and fair as when they were buried.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">Artificial</a> Flowers of the Chinese. See TONG-TSAO.\n\nFlowers, in the animal economy, denote women's monthly purgations or menes.\u2014Nicod derives the word in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, from fluere, q. d. flows. Others will have the name occasioned hence, that women do not conceive till they have had their flowers; so that these are a sort of forerunners of their fruit.\n\nFlowers, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">Rhetoric</a>, are figures or ornaments of discourse, by the Latins called floreuli.\n\nFLOWERING of Bulbous Plants. These plants will grow and flower in water alone, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and make a very elegant appearance. We daily see this practised in single roots; but there is a method of doing it with several roots in the same vessel. Take a common small garden pot; stop the hole at the bottom with a cork, and late in the cork with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTTY\">putty</a>, that no water can get through; then fit a board to the top of the pot, and bore five or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> holes in it at equal distances, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> the bulbs in; and as many smaller ones near them to receive sticks, which will serve to tie up the flowers. Then fill up the pot with water to the board; and place tulips, jonquils, narcissuses, and the like plants in the root upon the holes, so that the bottom of the roots may touch the water; thus will they all flower early in the season, and be much more beautiful than any pot of gathered flowers, and will last many weeks in their full perfection. After the season of flowering is over, the roots will gradually shrink through the holes of the board, and get loose into the water; but, instead of being spoiled there, they will soon increase in size; so that they cannot return through the holes, and will produce several offsets. It is natural to try from this the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of keeping the roots under water during the whole time of their blowing; and in this way they have been found to succeed very well, and flower even stronger and more beautifully than when in the ground. They may thus, also, with proper care in the degree of heat in the room, he kept flowering from before Christmas till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> or April. It is not easy, in this last manner, to manage the keeping the boards under water, for which reason, it is better to procure some sheet-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> of about four pounds to the foot, and cut this to the size of the mouth of the pot. In this there should be bored holes for the bulbs, and other holes for the sticks; and, in order to keep the sticks quite firm, it is proper to have another plate of lead shaped to the bottom of the pot, with holes in it, answering to those of the upper plate made for the sticks. The sticks will by this means be always kept perfectly steady; and the roots, being kept under water by the upper plate of lead, will flower in the most vigorous and beautiful manner imaginable. Some have thought of adding to the virtues of the water by putting in nitre in small quantities, and others have added earth and sand at the bottom; but it has always been found to succeed better without any addition.\n\nIt may be more agreeable to some to use glass jars in this last method with the leads, instead of earthen pots. The bulbs succeed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as well in these; and there is this advantage, that the progress of the roots is seen all the while, and they are managed better as to the supply of water.\n\nBy repeated experiments in this way on dried bulbs, and on those taken fresh out of the ground, the former have been found to succeed the best. For those taken fresh out of the ground being full of moisture, will not soon, upon changing their element, be nourished fully by a new one; and the fibres which they had struck in the ground, always rot when put into the water, and new ones must be formed in their places; so that it requires more time for them to come to flowering. The bulbs themselves will not rot in this manner; but they will never be so strong as those which were put into the water dry, which gradually fill themselves with moisture from it, and regularly plump up. The best method of managing the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> is this: Place the bulbs at first only on the surface of the water; for thus they will strike out their fibres most strongly. When they have stood thus six weeks, pour in the water so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as to cover them entirely, and keep them thus till they have done flowering.\n\nSometimes the roots will become mouldy in several parts while they stand above the water, and the cleaning them of it is no purpose; for it will eat and spread the farther, and frequently eat through two or three of their coats. In this case they must be immediately covered with water; when the mould will be stopped,\nFlowering stopped, and the roots become found, and flower as well as those which never had any such distemper. If the roots are suffered to remain in water all the year, they will not decay; but will flower again at their proper season, and that as vigorously as those which have been taken out and dried. The old fibres of those roots never rot till they are ready to push forth new ones. It is found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, that the hyacinth, and many other plants, grow to a greater degree of perfection when thus in water than when in the ground. There is a peculiar species of hyacinth called Keyser's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEWEL\">jewel</a>; this never, or very rarely, produces seed-vessels in the common way of flowering in the ground; but it will often produce some pods when blown in water.\n\nMr Millar has intimated, in the Philosophical Transactions, that bulbs set in glasses grow weaker, and should be renewed every other year; but it is found, that, when managed in this manner, and kept under water, at the time of taking them up, they are as large, and some of them larger, than when planted; and if these be dried at a proper season, they will flower, year after year, as well as fresh ones.\n\nRanunculus and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ANEMONE\">anemone</a> roots have been found to shoot up their stalks very well in this way; but the flowers are usually blasted, which seems to arise from want of free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. Pinks will flower very well in this manner; auriculas also may, with care, be brought to flower, but not strongly. Roses, jessamines, and honeysuckles, may also be made to flower this way, and will thrive and send out suckers; the best pieces to plant, are suckers cut off about three inches under ground, without any fibres. The succulent plants may also be raised this way; for instance, the opuntia or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> fig. If a fragment of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> of this plant be cut, and laid by to dry for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> till it is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> skin, as soon as it is put in this manner into water, it begins to plump up, and soon sends out <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FIBROUS\">fibrous</a> roots, and produces new leaves as quickly as it would do in the ground.\n\nThis is the more singular in these sorts of plants, because in their natural state in the ground, they cannot bear much water. This method of growing in water is not peculiar to the bulbous-rooted ones, but others may even be raised from feed by it. A bean or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEA\">pea</a>, let in this manner, will grow up to its proper standard, and will flower and produce pods which will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIPEN\">ripen</a> their seed. The smaller seeds may be also raised in this manner, by the help of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> to support them.\n\nNo vegetable transplanted out of the earth into water will thrive kindly; but any plant, whether raised from the root or feed in water, may be transplanted to the earth, and will succeed very well. It may be possible, therefore, from this method of raising plants in water, to come at a better way than is usually practised of raising some roots in the earth which are subject to rot there; such as anemones, ranunculuses, and hyacinths. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> dropped by chance upon the ground, will strike out both stronger and more numerous fibres than those which are planted in the usual way in the ground. On this principle, it may be proper to take out the earth of the bed where the bulbs are to stand at the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTING\">planting</a> them, to such a depth as they are to be placed under it when set for flowering. The bulbs are then to be set in their places, on the surface of this low ground; and to stand there till they have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> out their fibres and their head; then the earth is to be added over them by degrees, till they are covered as high above the head as they are in the usual manner of planting them; thus they would be preserved from the danger of rotting; and their fibres would be much stronger, and consequently they would draw more nourishment, and flower better, than in the common way. The common method of planting these roots renders them liable to be destroyed by either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> of a wet or a dry season. In the first case, they immediately rot by the abundant moisture they receive; and, in the second, they become dry as a stick and mouldy, so that they are infallibly rotted by the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> that falls afterwards.\n\nThe directions necessary to the success of the bulbs planted in water are these. When the leaden false bottoms are fixed down tight within two or three inches of the bottom of the vessel (which is only designed to hold the sticks steady which are to support the leaves and stalks), then lay on the lead upon which the bulbs are to rest, placing the notched part opposite to that in the false bottom, as near as the sticks, when placed, will suffer it; then place the bulbs one in each hole, and fill up with water to the upper lead. The bottom of the bulb will then touch the water; and as the water diminishes in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, keep it supplied with more up to the same height for a month or six weeks; in which time the bulbs will have shot strong fibres. Then fill up the water about half an inch above the surface of the lead; and, by degrees, as the fibres strengthen, and the plume floats from the head, keep the water higher and higher, till at length the whole bulb is covered. The water is to be kept at this standard till the season for drying them returns.\u2014At the time of planting the bulbs, they must be carefully cleaned from any foulnesses at the bottom, by scraping them with the point of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a> till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> part of the bulb appears; clear them likewise from any loose skins, and even take off their brown skin till they appear white; otherwise this brown skin will tinge the water, and the growth will not succeed so well.\n\nThe notches in the side of each lead are intended to give easy passage to the water, that, if there should be any foulness or sediment in it, on shaking it a little it may all run through, and fresh water be put in its place. But this shifting the water need not be done more than once or twice in a winter, as there may be occasion from the foulness; and when this is done, the sides of the vessel should be cleaned with a painter's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>, and rinsed out again, and the bulbs themselves washed, by pouring water on them at a little distance.\n\nAt any time when the outer skins of the bulbs dry, they are to be peeled off, that they may not occasion foulness in the water; and if any dust or foul matter be at any time observed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a> on the surface, the method is to fill up the pot or vessel to the rim, and let it run over: this will carry off that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> foulness, and the water may afterwards be poured away to the proper standard.\n\nBulbs of equal sizes should be planted together in the\nthe same pot, that they may all have the same benefit of the water. Narcissuses and hyacinths do well together; as also tulips and jonquils, and crocuses and snowdrops.","sp":313,"ep":317},{"h":"FLUDD","t":"ROBERT, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> and physician of some celebrity in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, was the son of Sir Thomas Fludd, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>; and was born at Milgate in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a>, in the year 1574.

He is chiefly known as a sectary in philosophy, and not as a physician. He bleeded the incomprehensible reveries of the Cabalists and Paracelsians, forming a new physical system replete with mystery and absurdity.

What are we then to think of these? <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> we will consider the progress of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> in the insect tribes in general, and especially in such of them as are most analogous to these, we shall find it less difficult to give an account of their origin than might have been imagined.\n\nA small quantity of water taken from any ditch in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> months, is found to be full of little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>, seeming in nothing so much as in size to differ from the microscopic animalcules. Nay, water, without these, exposed in open vessels to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, will be always found to abound with multitudes of them, visible to the naked eye, and full of life and motion. These we know, by their future changes, are the fly worms of the different species of gnats, and multitudes of other fly species; and we can easily determine, that they have owed their origin only to the eggs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> fly there deposited. Nay, a closer observation will at any time give ocular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of this; as the flies may be seen laying their eggs there, and the eggs may be followed through all their changes to the fly again. Why then are we to doubt but that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> abounds with other flies and animalcules as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> as the worms in those fluids; and that these last are only the fly worms of the former, which after a proper time spent in that state, will suffer changes like those of the larger kinds, and become flies like those to whose eggs they owed their origin? Vid. Reaumur, Hist. Insect., vol. iv. p. 431.\n\nThe differently medicated liquors made by infusions of different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, afford a proper matter for the worms of different species of these small flies: and there is no reason to doubt, but that among these some are viviparous, others oviparous; and to this may be, in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> owing the different time taken up for the production of these insects in different fluids. Those which are a proper matter for the worms of the viviparous fly, may be soonest found full of them; as, probably the liquor is no sooner in a state to afford them.\nthem proper nourishment, than their parents <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> them there; whereas those produced from the eggs of the little oviparous flies, must, after the liquor is in a proper state, and they are deposited in it in the form of eggs, have a proper time to be hatched, before they can appear alive.\n\nIt is easy to prove, that the animals we find in these vegetable infusions were brought thither from elsewhere. It is not less easy to prove, that they could not be in the matter infused any more than in the water in which it is infused.\n\nNotwithstanding the fabulous accounts of salamanders, it is now well known, that no animal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> or small, can bear the force of fire for any considerable time; and, by parity of reason, we are not to believe, that any insect, or embryo insect, in any state, can bear the heat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water for many minutes. To proceed to inquiries on this foundation: If several tubes filled with water, with a small quantity of vegetable matter, such as pepper, oak bark, truffles, &c., in which, after a time, insects will be discovered by the microscope; and other like tubes be filled with simple water boiled, with water and pepper boiled together, and with water with the two other ingredients all separately boiled in it; when all these liquors come to a proper time for the observation of the microscope, all, as well those which have been boiled as those which have not, will be found equally to abound with insects, and those of the same kind, in infusions of the same kind, whether boiled or not boiled. Those in the infusions which had sustained a heat capable of destroying animal life, must therefore not have subsisted either in the water or in the matters put into it, but must have been brought thither after the boiling; and it seems by no way so probably, as by means of some little winged inhabitants of the air depositing their eggs or worms in these fluids.\n\nOn this it is natural to ask, how it comes to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>, that while we see myriads of the progeny of these winged insects in water, we never see themselves? The answer is equally easy, viz. because we can always place a drop of this water immediately before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> of the microscope, and keep it there while we are at leisure to examine its contents; but that is not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with regard to the air inhabited by the parent flies of these worms, which is an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> in proportion to the water proper for nourishing these worms; and consequently, while the latter are clustered together in heaps, the former may be dispersed and scattered. Nor do we want instances of this, even in insects of a larger kind. In many of our gardens, we frequently find vessels of water filled with worms of the gnat kind, as plentifully, in proportion to their size, as those of other fluids are with animalcules.

In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>, where sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> does not take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, it might be doubted; and accordingly the Newtonian philosophers in general have been of opinion, that there are some substances essentially fluid, from the spherical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of their constituent particles. The congelation of mercury, however, by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, demonstrates that fluidity is not essentially inherent in mercury more than in other bodies.\n\nThat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> have vacuities in their substance is evident, because they may be made to dissolve certain bodies without sensibly increasing their bulk. For example, water will dissolve a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>; after which it will receive a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, and after that a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>, without increasing its first dimensions. Here we can scarcely suppose anything else than that the saline particles were interposed between those of the fluid; and as, by the mixture of salt and water, a considerable degree of cold is produced, we may thence easily see why the fluid receives these substances without any increase of bulk. All substances are expanded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, and reduced into less dimensions by cold; therefore, if any substance is added to a fluid, which tends to make it cold, the expansion by the bulk of the substance added will not be so much perceived as if this effect had not happened; and if the quantity added be small, the fluid will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> as much, perhaps more, from the cold produced by the mixture, than it will be expanded from the bulk of the salt.

It is played on by blowing it with the mouth; and the tones or notes are changed by stopping and opening the holes disposed for that purpose along its side.\n\nThis is a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> instrument. It was at first called the flute \u00e0 bec, from bec an old Gaulish word signifying the beak of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> or fowl, but more especially of a cock; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> flute \u00e0 bec must therefore signify the beaked flute; which appears very proper, on comparing it with the traverso or German flute. The word flute is derived from fluita, the Latin for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMPREY\">lamprey</a> or small eel taken in the Sicilian seas, having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> holes immediately below the gills on each side, the precise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of those in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the flute.\n\nBy Merlemus this instrument is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISTULA\">fistula</a> dulcis, seu Anglicus; the lowest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, according to him, for the treble flute, is C fa ut, and the compass of the instrument 15 notes. There is, however, a flute known by the name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> flute, the lowest note of which is F. Indeed, ever since the introduction of the flute into concerts, the lowest note of the instrument, of what size ever it is, has been called F; when in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> its pitch is determinable only by its correspondence in respect of acuteness or gravity with one or other of the chords in the scala maxima or great system.\n\nBesides the true concert flute, others of a less size were soon introduced into concerts of violins; in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the method was to write the flute part in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEY\">key</a> correspondent.\ncorrespondent to its pitch. This practice was introduced in 1710 by one Woodcock, a celebrated performer on this instrument, and William Babell organist of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of All-hallows, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">Bread</a> Street, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. They failed, however, in procuring for the flute a reception into concerts of various instruments; for which reason, one Thomas Stanely, a very curious maker of flutes and other instruments of the like kind, about the year 1732, adverting to the scale of Mercennius, in which the lowest note was C, invented what he called the new system; in which, by making the flute of such a size as to be a fifth above concert pitch, the lowest note became C, sol, fa ut. By this contrivance the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of transposing the flute part was taken away; for a flute of this size, adjusted to the system above mentioned, became an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OCTAVE\">octave</a> to the violin. To further this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of Stanely's, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEWIS\">Lewis</a> Merci, an excellent performer on the flute, published, about the year 1735, six folios for this instrument, three of which are said to be accommodated to Mr. Stanely's new system; but the German flute was now become a favourite instrument, and Stanely's ingenuity failed of its effect.\n\nOne great objection indeed lies against this instrument, which, however, equally affects all perforated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a>; namely, that they are never perfectly in tune, or cannot be made to play all their notes with equal exactness. The utmost that the makers of them can do is to tune them to some one key; as the hautboy to C, the German flute to D, and the English flute to F; and to effect this truly, is a matter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> small difficulty. The English flutes made by the younger Stanely came nearest of any to perfection; but those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRESLAU\">Breslau</a>, though excellent in their tone, are all too flat in the upper octave. For these reasons some are induced to think, that the utmost degree of proficiency on any of those instruments is not worth the labour of attaining it.\n\nGerman Flute, is an instrument entirely different from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> flute. It is not, like that, put into the mouth to be played; but the end is flopped with a stopper or plug, and the lower lip is applied to a hole about two inches and a half or three inches distant from the end. This instrument is usually about a foot and a half long; rather bigger at the upper end than the lower; and perforated with holes, besides that for the mouth, the lowest of which is stopped and opened by the little finger's pressing on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> or sometimes a silver key, like those in hautboys, bassoons, &c. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> is exceeding sweet and agreeable; and serves as a treble in a concert.\n\nFlute, or Flutti, is a kind of long vessel, with flat ribs or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> timbers, round behind, and swollen in the middle; serving chiefly for the carrying of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> in fleets or squadrons of ships; though it is often used in merchandise. The word flute taken for a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> or vessel, is derived, according to Borel, from the ancient flotte, a little boat. In the verbal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a> of St. Catharine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>, in the 12th century, we read Unus equum suum una cum mercibus magni ponderis introduxit super infrumentum de lignis fabricatum, vulgariter dictum flotta. Upon which the Bollandists observe, that in some copies it is read flotta, an instrument called by the Latins ratis; and that the word flutta or flotta arose from flotten or flotten, \"to float.\"\n\nFlutes, or Flutings, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">Architecture</a>, are perpendicular channels or cavities cut along the shaft of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> or pilaster. They are supposed to have been first introduced in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the plaiting of women's robes; and are therefore called by the Latins fringes and rugae. The French call them cannelures, as being excavations; and we, flutes or flutings, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> some resemblance to the musical instrument so called. They are chiefly affected in the Ionic order, in which they had their first rise; though they are also used in all the richer orders, as the Corinthian and Composite; but rarely in the Doric, and scarcely ever in the Tuscan.","sp":318,"ep":320},{"h":"FLUX","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METALLURGY\">Metallurgy</a>, is sometimes used synonymously with fufion. For instance, an ore, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, is said to be in a liquid flux, when it is completely fused.\n\nBut the word flux is generally used to signify certain saline matters, which facilitate the fusion of ores, and other matters which are difficultly fusible in effays and reductions of ores; such are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALKALIES\">alkalies</a>, nitre, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BORAX\">borax</a>, tartar, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>. But the word flux is more particularly applied to mixtures of different proportions of only nitre and tartar; and these fluxes are called by particular names, according to the proportions of these ingredients, as in the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">White</a> Flux, is made with equal parts of nitre and of tartar detonated together, by which they are alkalinized.\nThe residuum of this detonation is an alkali composed of the alkalies of the nitre and of the tartar, both which are absolutely of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. As the proportion of nitre in this mixture is more than is sufficient to consume entirely all the inflammable matter of the tartar, the alkali remaining after the detonation is perfectly white, and is therefore called white flux; and as this alkali is made very quickly, it is also called extemporaneous alkali. When a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> only of white flux is made, as a few ounces for instance, some nitre always remains undecomposed, and a little of the inflammable principle of the tartar, which gives a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> or even a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> to some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the flux; but this does not happen when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> quantity of white flux is made; because then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> is much greater. This small quantity of undecomposed nitre and tartar which remains in white flux is not hurtful in most of the metallic fusions in which this flux is employed; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the flux be required perfectly pure, it might easily be disengaged from those extraneous matters by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and strong calcination, without fusion.\n\nCrude Flux. By crude flux is meant the mixture of nitre and tartar in any proportions, without detonation. Thus the mixture of equal parts of the two salts used in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of the white flux, or the mixture of one part of nitre and two parts of tartar for the preparation of the black flux, are each of them a crude flux before detonation. It has also been called white flux, from its colour; but this might occasion it to be confounded with the white flux above described. The name, therefore, of crude flux is more convenient.\n\nCrude flux is detonated and alkalinized during the reductions and fusions in which it is employed; and is then changed into white or black flux, according to the proportions of which it is composed. This detonation produces good effects in these fusions and reductions, if the swelling and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAVASATION\">extravasation</a> of the detonating matters be guarded against. Accordingly, crude flux may be employed successfully in many operations; as, for instance, in the ordinary operation for procuring the regulus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a>.\n\nBlack Flux. Black flux is produced from the mixture of two parts of tartar and one part of nitre detonated together. As the quantity of nitre which enters into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of this flux is not sufficient to consume all the inflammable matters of the tartar, the alkali which remains after the detonation contains much black matter, of the nature of coal, and is therefore called black flux.","sp":320,"ep":321},{"h":"FLUXIONS","t":"Inverse Method\n\nLet us suppose we know that when \\( x = a \\), then \\( y = b \\); assume \\( x = a + t \\), and \\( y = b + u \\), then it is manifest, that, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the value of \\( u \\) be found by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> involving \\( t \\), all the terms of the series ought to vanish when \\( t = 0 \\).

But several boxes of these flies having been sent to Dr Hill for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, his report was this: \"There is in Martinique a fungus of the clavaria kind, different in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> from those hitherto known. It produces sboles from its sides; I call it therefore clavaria lobolifera.

The cicada is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in Martinique; and in its nymphal state, in which the old authors call it tettigometra, it buries itself under dead leaves to wait its change; and when the season is unfavourable, many perish.

On examining these leaves about the middle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, the time at which the flies used to be produced, there are found on them a sort of bags of a tough <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, of about the size of a filbert, and of a dusky greenish colour. On opening one of these bags with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, there is usually found a single full grown fly, of the gnat kind, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of small worms, which in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> or two more have wings and fly away in the form of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a>. The tree is of the mulberry kind, and its leaves are usually very largely stocked with these insect bags; and the generality of them are found to contain the insects in their worm state; when they become winged, they soon make their way out. The bags begin to appear when the leaves are young, and afterwards grow with them; but they never rumple the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> or injure its shape.

They called the point of the tree in a wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>, which, on account of some resemblance in its shape, the Spaniards called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a>. From this cylinder hung four strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a>, which served to support a square frame. In the space between the cylinder and the frame, they fixed four other thick ropes, which they twisted as many times round the tree as there were revolutions to be made by the flyers. These ropes were drawn through four holes, made in the middle of the four planks of which the frame consisted. The four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> flyers, disguised like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAGLES\">eagles</a>, herons, and other birds, mounted the tree with great agility, by means of a rope which was laced about it from the ground up to the frame; from the frame they mounted one at a time successively upon the cylinder, and after having danced there a little, they tied themselves round with the ends of the ropes, which were drawn through the holes of the frame, and launching with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> from it, began their flight with their wings expanded. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of their bodies put the frame and the cylinder in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>; the frame by its revolutions gradually untwisted the cords by which the flyers swung; so that as the ropes lengthened, they made so much the greater circles in their flight. Whilst these four were flying, a fifth danced upon the cylinder, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> a little drum, or waving a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a>, without the smallest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of the danger he was in of being precipitated from such a height. The others who were upon the frame (10 or 12 persons generally mounted), as soon as they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the flyers in their last revolution, precipitated themselves by the same ropes, in order to reach the ground at the same time amidst the acclamations of the populace. Those who precipitated themselves in this manner by the ropes, that they might make a still greater display of their agility,\nFlying agility, frequently passed from one rope to another, at that part where, on account of the little distance between them, it was possible for them to do so. The most essential point of this performance consisted in proportioning to justify the height of the tree with the length of the ropes, that the flyers should reach the ground with 13 revolutions, to represent by such number their century of 52 years, composed in the manner we have already mentioned. This celebrated diversion is still in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>; but no particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> is paid to the number of the revolutions of the flyers; as the frame is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> hexagonal or octagonal, and the flyers six or eight in number. In some places they put a rail round the frame, to prevent accidents, which were frequent after the conquest; as the Indians became much given to drinking, and used to mount the tree when intoxicated with wine or brandy, and were unable to keep their station on so great a height, which was usually 60 feet.","sp":402,"ep":408},{"h":"FLYING","t":"the progressive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> other winged animal, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>.\n\nThe parts of birds chiefly concerned in flying are the wings and tail; by the first, the bird sustains and wafts himself along; and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, he is assisted, in ascending and descending, to keep his body poised and upright, and to obviate the vacillations thereof.\n\nIt is by the size and strength of the pectoral muscles, that birds are so well disposed for quick, strong, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> flying. These muscles, which in men are scarcely a 70th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the muscles of the body, in birds exceed and outweigh all the other muscles taken together; upon which Mr Willoughby makes this reflection, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it be possible for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> to fly, his wings must be so contrived and adapted, that he may make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of his legs, and not his arms, in managing them.\n\nThe tail, Messrs Willoughby, Ray, and many others, imagine to be principally employed in steering and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the body in the air, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUDDER\">rudder</a>; but Borelli has put it beyond all doubt, that this is the least use of it, which is chiefly to assist the bird in its ascent and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> in the air, and to obviate the vacillations of the body and wings; for, as to turning to this or that side, it is performed by the wings and inclination of the body, and but very little by the help of the tail. The flying of a bird, in effect, is quite a different thing from the rowing of a vessel. Birds do not vibrate their wings towards the tail, as oars are struck towards the stern, but waft them downwards; nor does the tail of the bird cut the air at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> as the rudder does the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; but is disposed horizontally, and preserves the same situation whatever way the bird turns. In effect, as a vessel is turned about on its centre of gravity to the right, by a brisk application of the oars to the left; so a bird, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> the air with its right wing alone, towards the tail, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> turn its fore part to the left. Thus pigeons changing their course to the left, would labour it with their right wing, keeping the other almost at rest. Birds of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> neck alter their course by the inclination of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> and neck; which altering the course of gravity, the bird will proceed in a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>.\n\nThe manner of Flying is thus. The bird first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENDS\">bends</a> his legs, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> with a violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAP\">leap</a> from the ground; then opens and expands the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> of his wings, so as to make a right line perpendicular to the sides of his body: thus the wings, with all the feathers therein, constitute one continued lamina. Being now raised a little above the horizon, and vibrating the wings with great force and velocity perpendicularly against the subject air, that fluid resists those succussions, both from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> inactivity and elasticity, by means of which the whole body of the bird is protruded. The resistance the air makes to the withdrawing of the wings, and consequently the progress of the bird, will be so much the greater, as the waft or stroke of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAN\">fan</a> of the wing is longer: but as the force of the wing is continually diminished by this resistance, when the two forces continue to be in equilibrium, the bird will remain suspended in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>; for the bird only ascends so long as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of air the wing describes makes a resistance equal to the excess of the specific gravity of the bird above the air. If the air, therefore, be so rare as to give way with the same velocity as it is struck withal, there will be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> resistance, and consequently the bird can never mount. Birds never fly upwards in a perpendicular line, but always in a parabola. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> ascent, the natural and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> tendency would oppose and destroy each other, so that the progress would be very slow. In a direct descent they would aid one another, so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> would be too precipitate.\n\nArtificial Flying, that attempted by men, by the affluence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>.\n\nThe art of flying has been attempted by several persons in all ages. The Leucadians, out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, are reported to have had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of precipitating a man from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> cliff into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, first fixing feathers, variously expanded, round his body, in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the fall.\n\nFriar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a>, who lived near 500 years ago, not only affirms the art of flying possible, but affords us, that he himself knew how to make an engine wherein a man fitting might be able to convey himself through the air like a bird; and further adds, that there was then one who had tried it with success. The secret consisted in a couple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> thin hollow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> globes, exhausted of air; which being much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> than air, would sustain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> whereon a person might sit. Father Francisco Lana, in his Prodromo, proposes the same thing, as his own thought. He computes, that a round vessel of plate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, 14 feet in diameter, weighing three ounces the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> foot, will only weigh 1848 ounces; whereas a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of air of the same bulk will weigh 2155\u00bd ounces; so that the globe will not only be sustained in the air, but will carry with it a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of 373\u00bd ounces; and by increasing the bulk of the globe, without increasing the thickness of the metal, he adds, a vessel might be made to carry a much greater weight.\u2014But the fallacy is obvious: a globe of the dimensions he describes, Dr Hook shows, would not sustain the prelure of the air, but be crushed inwards. Besides, in whatever ratio the bulk of the globe were increased, in the same must the thickness of the metal, and consequently the weight be increased: so that there would be no advantage in such augmentation.

To ascertain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> and value of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> coins, he carefully consulted the cabinets of the curious; and on his return home he presented to the Antiquarian Society, of which he was a member, a dissertation on this subject. He read before the same learned body, a dissertation on the measurement of Trajan's and Antonine's pillars, together with other remains of antiquity. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of his observations he presented to the Royal Society; and, in particular, \"Remarks on the standard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> preserved in the Capitol of Rome,\" and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of an ancient globe in the Farnesian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>.

The first is the tomb of the father of Hong-vou, to decorate which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> expense was spared; it is called Hoan-lin, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Tomb.

The third is a magnificent temple erected to the god Fo. At first it was only a pagod, to which Hong-vou retired after having lost his parents, and where he was admitted as an inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a>; but, having soon become weary of this kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, he enlisted with the chief of a band of banditti, who had revolted from the Tartars. As he was bold and enterprising, the general made choice of him for his son-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>; soon after, he was declared his successor by the unanimous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of the troops.

Lat. 40. 22.","sp":414,"ep":414},{"h":"FONTAINE","t":"JOHN, the celebrated French poet, and one of the first-rate geniuses of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, was born at Chateau-Thierry in Champagne, the 8th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1621, of a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>. At the age of 19 he entered amongst the Oratorians, but quitted that order 18 months after. He was 22 years of age before he knew his own talents for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>; but hearing an ode of Malherbe read, upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFIRMATION\">affirmation</a> of Henry IV., he was so taken with admiration of it, that the poetical fire, which had before lain dormant within him, seemed to be enkindled from that of the other great poet. He applied himself to read, to meditate, to repeat, in fine to imitate, the works of Malherbe. The first essays of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> he confined to one of his relations who made him read the best Latin authors, Horace, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>, Terence, Quintilian, &c. and then the best\nbest compositions in French and Italian. He applied himself likewise to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the Greek authors, particularly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> and Plutarch. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> afterwards his parents made him marry a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a>-general, a relation of the great Racine. This young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>, besides her very great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, was remarkable for the delicacy of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>, and Fontaine never composed any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> without consulting her. But as her temper was none of the best, to avoid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a>, he separated himself from her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> as often as he well could. The famous duchess of Bouillon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIECE\">niece</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Mazarine, being exiled to Chateau-Thierry, took particular notice of Fontaine. Upon her recall, he followed her to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>; where by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of one of his relations, he got a pension settled upon him. He met with great friends and protectors amongst the most distinguished persons of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, but Madame de la Sabli\u00e8re was the most particular. She took him to live at her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, and it was then that Fontaine, divested of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> concerns, led a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> conformable to his disposition, and cultivated an acquaintance with all the great men of the age. It was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, after he was fixed at Paris, to go every year, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of September, to his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of Chateau-Thierry, and pay a visit to his wife, carrying with him Racine, Defreux, Chapelle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> some other celebrated writers. When he has sometimes gone thither alone by himself, he has come away without remembering even to call upon her; but seldom omitted telling some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his lands, by which means he squandered away a considerable fortune. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Madame de la Sabli\u00e8re, he was invited into England, particularly by Madame Mazarine, and by St Evremont, who promised him all the sweets and comforts of life; but the difficulty of learning the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, and the liberality of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURGUNDY\">Burgundy</a>, prevented his voyage.\n\nAbout the end of the year 1692 he fell dangerously ill; and, as is customary upon these occasions in the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, he made a general confession of his whole life to P. Poguet, an Oratorian; and, before he received the sacrament, he sent for the gentlemen of the French Academy, and in their presence declared his sincere compunction for having composed his Tales; a work he could not reflect upon without the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPENTANCE\">repentance</a> and detestation; promising that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it should please God to restore his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, he would employ his talents only in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> upon matters of morality or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>. He survived this illness two years, living in the most exemplary and edifying manner, and died the 13th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1695, being 74 years of age. When they stripped his body, they found next his skin a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> shirt; which gave room for the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of the younger Racine:\n\nEt l'Auteur de Jaconde est orn\u00e9 d'un Cilice.\n\nFontaine's character is remarkable for a simplicity, candour, and probity, seldom to be met with. He was of an obliging disposition; cultivating a real friendship with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> poets and authors; and what is very rare, beloved and esteemed by them all. His conversation was neither gay nor brilliant, especially when he was not amongst his intimate friends. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> being invited to a dinner at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> general's, he ate a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a>, but did not speak. Rising up from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> very early, under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> of going to the academy, one of Fontaine's company represented to him that it was not yet a proper time: \"Well (says he), if it is not, I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> stay a little longer.\" He had one son by his wife in the year 1660. At the age of 14, he put him into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of M. de Harley, the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a>, recommending to him his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> and fortune. It is said, that having been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time without seeing him, he happened to meet him one day visiting, without recollecting him again, and mentioned to the company that he thought that young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> had a good deal of wit and understanding. When they told him it was his own son, he answered in the most tranquil manner, \"Ha! truly I am glad on't.\" An indifference, or rather an absence of mind, influenced his whole conduct, and rendered him often insensible to the inclemency of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. Madame de Bouillon going one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> to Verfaillies, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> him, abstracted in thought, sitting in an arbour; returning at night, she found him in the same place, and in the same attitude, although it was very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, and had rained almost the whole day. He carried this simplicity so far, that he was scarcely sensible of the bad effects some of his writings might occasion, particularly his Tales. In a great sickness, his confessors exhorted him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a> and alms deeds: \"As for alms deeds (replied Fontaine), I am not able, having nothing to give; but they are about publishing a new edition of my Tales, and the bookeller owes me a hundred copies; you shall have them to sell, and distribute their amount amongst the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>.\" Another time P. Poguet exhorting him to repent of his faults, \"If he has committed any (cried the nurse), I am sure it is more from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> than malice, for he has as much simplicity as an infant.\" One time having composed a tale, wherein he made a profane application of those words of the Gospel, \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>, five talents thou didst deliver to me,\" he dedicated it, by a most ingenious prologue, to the celebrated Arnauld, telling him, it was to show how to povertify the great esteem he had for the learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a>. He was not sensible of the indecency of the dedication, and the profane application of the text, till Boileau and Racine represented it to him. He addressed another, by a dedication in the same manner, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of Paris. His Fables are an immortal work, exceeding everything in that kind, both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of the learned. People of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, the oftener they read them, will find continually new beauties and charms, not to be met with elsewhere. The descendants of this great poet are exempted in France from all taxes and impositions; a privilege which the intendants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOISSONS\">Soissons</a> to this day think it an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to confirm to them.","sp":413,"ep":414},{"h":"FONTAINES","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> Francis, a French critic, was born of a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROUEN\">Rouen</a> in 1685. At 15, he entered into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of the Jesuits; and at 30, quitted\nFontaines quitted it, for the sake of returning to the world. He was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>, and had a cure in Normandy; but left it, Fontarabia, and was, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> and letters, some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">cardinal</a> d'Auvergne. Having excited some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> by certain critical productions, the Abb\u00e9 Bignon in 1724 committed to him the Journal des Savans. He acquitted himself well in this department, and was peaceably enjoying the applause of the public, when his enemies, whom by critical strictures in his Journal he had made such, formed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a> against him of a most abominable crime, and procured him to be imprisoned. By the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> of powerful friends, he was set at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> in 15 days: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a> took upon himself the trouble of justifying him in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to the Abb\u00e9 Bignon; and this letter having been read amidst his fellow labourers in the Journal, he was unanimously re-established in his former credit. This happened in 1725. But with whatever repute he might acquit himself in this Journal, frequent difficulties made him frequently abandon it. He laboured meanwhile in some new periodical works, from which he derived his greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>. In 1731, he began one under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Nouvelliste du Parnasse, ou R\u00e9flexions sur les Ouvrages nouveaux: but only proceeded to two volumes; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> having been suppressed by authority, from the incessant complaints of authors ridiculed therein. About three years after, in 1735, he obtained a new privilege for a periodical production, entitled, Observations sur les \u00c9crits Modernes; which, after continuing to 33 volumes, was suppressed again in 1743. Yet the year following, 1744, he published another weekly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, called, Juges sur les Ouvrages nouveaux, and proceeded to 11 volumes: the two last being done by other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>. In 1745, he was attacked with a disorder in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, which ended in a dropy that proved fatal in five weeks. \"He was (says M. Freron) born a sentimental person; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> in conduct as well as in principle; exempt from ambition; and of a noble firm spirit, which would not submit to sue for preferments <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> titles. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> conversation he appeared only a common man; but when subjects of literature, or any thing out of the ordinary way, were agitated, he discovered great force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> and wit.\" Besides the periodical works mentioned above, he was the author of many others: his biographer gives us <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less than 17 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>; many of them critical, some historical, and some translations from English writers, chiefly from Pope, Swift, Fielding, &c.

He received his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> of Jesuits at Rouen, where the quickness of his parts became conspicuous at a very early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>. He was capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> Latin verses when only 13, which were deemed worthy of being published. He studied the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> at the desire of his father; but as he lost the very first cause in which he was employed as an advocate, he became disgusted with his profession, and devoted himself entirely to literature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>. He composed a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the operas of Pyche and Bellerophon, which were printed under the name of his uncle Thomas Corneille. He wrote a tragedy called Alpar, but as it did not succeed, he consigned the manuscript to the flames, and never afterwards attempted that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>. His Dialogues of the dead were published in the year 1683, which were well received, as a specimen of elegant composition, combining morality with the charms of literature. His \"Lettres du Chevalier d'Her,\" published in 1685 without his name, discovered much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> and ingenuity, but at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> small share of affectation. His \"Entretiens sur la Pluralit\u00e9 des Mondes\" has been regarded as one of his ablest performances, combining science and philosophy with vivacity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> which may be said to belong almost exclusively to the French. It was perused by all, and translated into several foreign languages.\n\nIn his \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORACLES\">Oracles</a>,\" he supported the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that oracles were forgeries, in opposition to those who contended that they were supernatural operations of evil spirits, put to silence by the appearing of Christ, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> he exposed himself to clerical animadversion. His \"Pastoral Poems\" appeared in the year 1688, with a discourse on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the eclogue, which were very much admired for their delicacy of sentiment, as was also his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">opera</a> of \"Theis and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PELEUS\">Peleus</a>;\" but his \"Aeneas and Lavinia\" was not so successful. In the year 1699, Fontanelle was chosen secretary of the Academy of Sciences, which office he held during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> period of 42 years. He published a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> annually of the history of that learned body, filled with analyses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a>, and eulogiums on deceased members.\n\nAs a poet, he did not rise above elegance and ingenuity; as a man of science, he rather excelled in throwing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the inventions of others, than in discovering any new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> himself, and as a general writer, he united <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> with the delicacy and refinement of a man of wit. He studied his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> as much as most men, but he never sacrificed to the promotion of it, the duties of a man of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>. He had many friends, and towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, scarcely a single enemy. He was never married, and for a man of letters he acquired considerable affluence. Although of a delicate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, he reached the great age of 90 without any complaint but dullness of hearing. He died on the 9th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1757, being almost a hundred years of age.

On account of the superior numbers of the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, and the superior generalship of their commander, the allies were defeated with great slaughter. The British troops behaved with great intrepidity, as their enemies themselves acknowledged. It has been said, that the battle was lost through the cowardice of the Dutch, who failed in their attack on the village of Fontenoy, on which the event of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> depended.

Varro observes, that it was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> to visit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELLS\">wells</a> on those days, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> crowns into fountains. Scaliger, in his conjectures on Varro, takes this not to be a feast of fountains in general, as Feltus intimates, but of the fountain which had a temple at Rome, near the Porta Capena, called also Porta Fontinalis: he adds, that it is of this fountain Cicero speaks in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> book De Legibus.

By and by they began to affix to each other, by general consent, portions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> to produce them their supply of vegetables; after this, reason suggested the expedient of domesticating certain animals, both to assist them in their labours and supply them with food. Hogs were the first animals of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> kind that appeared upon their tables; they held it to be ungrateful to devour the beasts that afflicted them in their labours.\u2014When they began to make a free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of domestic animals, they roasted them only: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> was a refinement in cookery which for ages they were strangers to; and fish living in an element men were unused to, were not eaten till they grew somewhat civilized. Menelaus complains, in the Odyssey, that they had been constrained to feed upon them.\n\nThe most remarkable distinction of foods, in a medical view, is into those which are already assimilated into the animal nature, and such as are not. Of the first kind are animal substances in general; which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not entirely similar, are nearly so, to our nature. The second comprehends vegetables, which are much more difficultly assimilated. But as the nourishment of all animals, even those which live on other animals, can be traced originally to the vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, that the principle of all nourishment is in vegetables.\n\nThough there is perhaps no vegetable which does not afford nourishment to some species of animals or other; yet, with regard to mankind, a very considerable distinction is to be made. Those vegetables which are of a mild, bland, agreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, are proper nourishment; while those of an acrid, bitter, and nauseous nature, are improper. We use, indeed, several acid substances as food; but the mild, the bland, and agreeable, are in the largest proportion in almost every vegetable. Such as are very acrid, and at the same time of an aromatic nature, are not used as food, but as spices or condiments, which answer the purposes of medicines rather than any thing else. Sometimes, indeed, acrid and bitter vegetables seem to be admitted as food. Thus celeri and endive are used in common food, though both are substances of considerable acrimony; but it must be observed, that, when we use them, they are previously blanched, which almost totally destroys their acrimony. Or if we employ other acrid substances, we generally, in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, deprive them of their acrimony by boiling. In different countries, the same plants grow with different degrees of acrimony. Thus, garlic here seldom enters our food; but in the southern countries, where the plants grow more mild, they are frequently used for that purpose. The plant which furnishes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAYENNE\">cayenne</a>, being very acrimonious, and even poisonous, in its recent state, affords an instance of the necessity of preparing acid substances even in the hot countries; and there are other plants, such as arum root, which are so exceedingly acrimonious in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> state, that they cannot be swallowed with safety; yet, when deprived of that acrimony, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> afford good nourishment.\n\nThe most remarkable properties of different vegetable substances as food, are taken notice of under their different names: here we shall only compare vegetable foods in general with those of the animal kind.\n\nI. In the Stomach, they differ remarkably, in that the vegetables always have a tendency to acidity, while animal\nanimal food of all kinds rather tends to alkalescence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>. Some animal foods, indeed, turn manifestly acid before they putrefy; and it has been asserted, that some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of acclency takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in every kind of animal food before digestion. This acclency of animal food, however, never comes to any morbid degree, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> is always on the side of putrefaction. The acclency of vegetables is more frequent, and ought to be more attended to, than the alkalescence of animal food; which last, even in weak stomachs, is seldom felt; while acclency greatly affects both the stomach and system.\n\nWith regard to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of solution:\u2014Heaviness, as it is called, is seldom felt from vegetables, except from tough farinaceous pastes, or the most viscous substances; while the heaviness of animal food is more frequently noticed, especially when in any great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>. Difficulty of solution does not depend so much on firmness of texture (as a man, from fills of all kinds, is more oppressed than from firmer substances) as on viscosity; and hence it is more frequent in animal food, especially in the younger animals.\n\nWith regard to mixture:\u2014There is no influence of difficult mixture in vegetables, except in vegetable oils; while animal foods, from both viscosity and oiliness, especially the fatter meats, are refractory in this respect. Perhaps the difference of animal and vegetable foods might be referred to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of mixture. For vegetable food continues long in the stomach, giving little stimulus: Now the system is affected in proportion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of this stimulus, which is incomparably greater from the animal viscous oily food, than from the vegetable, firmer, and more aqueous. However, there are certain applications to the stomach, which have a tendency to bring on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> fit of fever, independent of stimulus, merely by their refrigeration: and this often arises from vegetables; as we see, in those hot countries where intermittents prevail, they are often induced from a surfeit of vegetable than of animal food. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of this is, that when one is recovering of an intermittent, there is nothing more apt to cause a relapse than cold food, especially if taken on those days when the fit should return, and particularly acclent, fermentable vegetables, as salads, melons, cucumbers, &c., acido-dulces, &c., which, according to Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a>, are the most frequent causes of epidemics; therefore, when an intermittent is to be avoided, we shun vegetable diet, and give animal foods, although their stimulus be greater.\n\nII. In the Intestines. When the putrefaction of animal food has gone too far, it produces an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> stimulus, causing diarrhoea, dysentery, &c. But these effects are but rare; whereas from vegetable food and its acid, which, united with the bile, proves a pretty strong stimulus, they more frequently occur; but, luckily, are of less consequence, if the refrigeration is not very great. In the autumnal season, when there is a tendency to dysentery, if it is observed that eating of fruits brings it on, it is rather to be ascribed to their cooling than stimulating the intestines.\n\nAs to stool:\u2014Wherever neither putrefaction nor acidity has gone a great length, animal food keeps the belly more regular. Vegetable food gives a greater proportion of succulent matter, and, when excreted by the stomach and intestines, is more apt to stagnate, and produce slow belly and costiveness, than animal stimulating food; which, before it comes to the great guts, where stoppage is made, has obtained a putrefactive tendency, and gives a proper stimulus: and thus those who are colicive from the use of vegetables; when they have recourse to animal food are in this respect better.\n\nIII. In the blood-vessels. They both give a blood of the same kind, but of different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. Animal food gives it in greater quantity, being in great part, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> is, convertible in succum et sanguinem, and of easy digestion; whereas vegetable is more watery, and contains a portion of unconquerable saline matter, which causes it to be thrown out of the body by some excretion. Animal food affords a more dense stimulating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> blood than vegetable; stretching and causing a great resistance in the solids, and again exciting their stronger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. It has been supposed that acclency of vegetable food is carried into the blood-vessels, and there exerts its effects; but the tendency of animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> is so strong to alkalescence, that the existence of an acid acrimony in the blood seems very improbable. Animal food alone will soon produce an alkalescent acrimony; and if a person who lives entirely on vegetables were to take no food for a few days, his acrimony would be alkalescent.\n\nIV. We are next to take notice of the quantity of nutriment these different foods afford. Nutriment is of two kinds: the first repairs the waste of the solid fibres; the other supplies certain fluids, the chief of which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>. Now, as animal food is easier converted, and also longer retained in the system, and as it contains a greater proportion of oil, it will afford both kinds of nutriment more copiously than vegetables.\n\nV. Lastly, As to the different degrees of perspirability of these foods. This is not yet properly determined. Sanctius constantly speaks of mutton as the most perspirable of all food, and of vegetables as checking perspiration. This is a consequence of the different stimulus these foods give to the stomach, so that persons who live on vegetables have not their perspiration so suddenly excited. In time of digestion, perspiration is stopped from whatever food, much more so from cooling vegetables. Another reason why vegetables are less perspirable is, because their aqueo-saline juices determine them to go off by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>, while the more perfectly mixed animal food is more equally diffused over the system, and so goes off by perspiration. Hence Sanctius's accounts may be understood; for vegetable aliment is not longer retained in the body, but mostly takes the course of the kidneys. Both are equally perspirable in this respect, viz., that a person living on either returns once a day to his usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>; and if we consider the little nourishment of vegetables, and the great tendency of animal food to corpulency, we must allow that vegetable is more quickly perspired than animal food.\n\nAs to the question, Whether man was originally designed for animal or vegetable food, see the article CARNIVOROUS.\n\nWith regard to the effects of these foods on men, it must be observed, that there are no persons who live entirely on vegetables. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGOREANS\">Pythagoreans</a> themselves ate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>; and those who do so mostly, as the Pythagoreans, are weakly, sickly, and meagre, labouring\ning under a constant diarrhoea and several other difficul-\nties. None of the hardy, robust, live on these; but\nchiefly such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> a livelihood by the exertion of their\nmental faculties, as (in the East Indies) factors and\nbrokers; and this method of life is now confined to\nthe hot climates, where vegetable diet, without incon-\nvenience, may be carried to great excess. Though it\nbe granted, therefore, that man is intended to live on\nthese different foods promiscuously, yet the vegetable\nshould be in very great proportion. Thus the Lap-\nlanders are said to live entirely on animal food: but\nthis is contradicted by the best accounts; for Linnaeus\nsays, that besides milk, which they take four, to ob-\nviate the bad effects of animal food, they use also cala-\nmenyanthes, and many other plants, copiously. So\nthere is no instance of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> living entirely either\non vegetable or animal food, though there are indeed\nsome who live particularly on one or other in the greatest\nproportion. In the cold countries, e.g. the inhabi-\ntants live chiefly on animal food, on account of the\nrigour of the season, their smaller perspiration, and little\ntendency to putrefaction.\n\nOf more importance, however, is the following than\nthe former question, viz. In what proportion animal and\nvegetable food ought to be mixed?\n\n1. Animal food certainly gives most strength to\nthe system. It is a known aphorism of Sanctorius,\nthat *pondus addit robur*; which may be explained from\nthe impletion of the blood-vessels, and giving a proper\ndegree of tension for the performance of strong oscil-\nlations. Now animal food not only goes a greater\nway in supplying fluid, but also gives the fluid more\ndense and elastic. The art of giving the utmost strength\nto the system is best understood by those who breed\nfighting cocks. These people raise the cocks to a cer-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAIN\">tain</a> weight, which must bear a certain proportion to\nthe other parts of the system, and which at the same\ntime is so nicely proportioned, as that, on losing a few\nounces of it, their strength is very considerably im-\npaired. Dr Robinson of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a> has observed, that\nthe force and weight of the system ought to be deter-\nmined by the largeness of the heart, and its proportion\nto the system: for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> heart will give large blood-\nvessels, while at the same time the vasa are less, par-\nticularly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a>; which last being increased in size,\na greater quantity of fluid is determined into the cel-\nlular texture, and less into the sanguineous system.\nHence we see how animal food gives strength, by fill-\ning the sanguiferous vessels. What pains we now be-\nlow on cocks, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> did on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATHLETE\">athlete</a>, by\nproper nourishment bringing them to a great degree of\nstrength and agility. It is said that men were at first\nfed on figs, a proof of which we have from their nu-\ntritious quality; however, in this respect they were\nsoon found to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> far short of animal food; and thus\nwe see, that men, in some measure, will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> in pro-\nportion to the quality of their food. The English la-\nbour more than the Scots; and wherever men are ex-\nposed to hard labour, their food should be animal.\u2014\nAnimal food, although it gives strength, yet loads the\nbody; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a> long ago observed, that the\nathletic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>, by a small increase, was exposed to the\ngreatest hazards. Hence it is only proper for bodily\nlabours, and entirely improper for mental exercises;\nfor whoever would keep his mind acute and penetrat-\ning, will exceed rather on the side of vegetable food.\nEven the body is oppressed with animal food; a full\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a> always produces dulness, laziness, and yawning;\nand hence the feeding of gamesters, whose mind must\nbe ready to take advantage, is always performed by\navoiding a large quantity of animal food. Farther,\nWith regard to the strength of the body, animal food,\nin the first stage of life, is hardly necessary to give\nstrength: in manhood, when we are exposed to active\nlicences, it is more allowable; and even in the decline\nof life, some proportion of it is necessary to keep the\nbody in vigour. There are some diseases which come\non in the decay of life, at least are aggravated by it;\namong these the most remarkable is the gout. This,\nwhen it is in the system, and does not appear with in-\nflammation in the extremities, has pernicious effects\nthere, attacking the lungs, stomach, head, &c. Now\nto determine this to the extremities, a large proportion\nof animal food is necessary, especially as the person is\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> incapable of much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>.\n\nAnimal food, although it gives strength, is yet of\nmany hazards to the system, as it produces plethora and\nall its consequences. As a stimulus to the stomach and\nto the whole system, it excites fever, urges the circula-\ntion, and promotes the perspiration. The system,\nhowever, by the repetition of these stimuli, is soon worn\nout; and a man who has early used the athletic diet,\nis either early carried off by inflammatory diseases, or,\nif he takes exercise sufficient to render that diet salutary,\nsuch an accumulation is made of putrefactive fluids, as in\nhis after life lays a foundation for the most inveterate\nchronic distempers. Therefore it is to be questioned,\nwhether we should desire this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> degree of bodily\nstrength, with all the inconveniences and dangers at-\ntending it. Those who are chiefly employed in mental\nresearches, and not exposed to too much bodily labour,\nshould always avoid an excess of animal food. There\nis a disease which seems to require animal food, viz.\nthe hysterical, or hypochondriac; and which appears to\nbe very much akin to the gout, affecting the alimentary\ncanal. All people affected with this disease are\nmuch disposed to acephaly; which sometimes goes so\nfar, that no other vegetable but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> can be taken in,\nwithout occasioning the worst consequences. Here then\nwe are obliged to prefer the animal diet, even to those\nof very weak organs; for it generally obviates the\nsymptoms. However, several instances of fever in ex-\ncess have been produced by a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> use of this\ndiet, which it is always unlucky to be obliged to pre-\nscribe; and when it is absolutely necessary to prescribe,\nit should be joined with as much of the vegetable as\npossible, and when a cure is performed we should gradu-\nally recur to that again.\n\n2. Next, let us consider the vegetable diet. The chief\ninconvenience of this is difficulty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSIMILATION\">assimilation</a>; which,\nhowever, in the vigorous and exercised, will not be li-\nable to occur. In warm climates, the assimilation of\nvegetable aliment is more easy, so that there it may be\nmore used, and when joined to exercise gives a pretty\ntolerable degree of strength and vigour; and though\nthe general rule be in favour of animal diet, for giving\nstrength, yet there are many instances of its being\nremarkably produced from vegetable. Vegetable diet\nhas this advantage, that it whets the appetite, and that\nwe can hardly suffer from a full meal of it. Besides.\nthe disorders it is liable to produce in the prime via, and its falling short to give strength, there seem to be no bad consequences it can produce in the blood vessels; for there is no influence where its peculiar acrimony was ever carried there, and it is certainly less putrefactive than animal food; nor, without the utmost indolence, and a sharp appetite, does it give plethora, or any of its consequences: so that we cannot here but conclude, that a large proportion of vegetable food is useful for the generality of mankind.\n\nThere is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> more dangerous, or more common, than the neglect of bread; for it is the safest of vegetable aliments, and the best corrector of animal food; and, by a large proportion of this alone, its bad consequences, when used in a hypochondriac state, have been obviated. The French apparently have as much animal food on their tables as the British; and yet, by a greater use of bread and the dried acid fruits, its bad effects are prevented; and therefore bread should be particularly used by the English, as they are so voracious of animal food. Vegetable food is not only necessary to secure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, but long life: and, as we have said, in infancy and youth we should be confined to it mostly; in manhood, and decay of life, use animal food; and, near the end, vegetable again.\n\nThere is another question much agitated, viz. What are the effects of variety in food? Is it necessary and allowable, or universally hurtful? Variety of a certain kind seems necessary; as vegetable and animal foods have their mutual advantages, tending to correct each other. Another variety, which is very proper, is that of liquid and solid food, which should be so managed as to temper each other; and liquid food, especially of the vegetable kind, is too ready to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> off before it is properly assimilated, while solid food makes a long stay. But this does not properly belong to the question, whether variety of the same kind is necessary or proper, as in animal foods, beef, fish, fowl, &c. It doth not appear that there is any inconvenience arising from this mixture or difficulty of assimilation, provided a moderate quantity be taken. When an inconvenience does arise, it probably proceeds from this, that one of the particular substances in the mixture, when taken by itself would produce the same effects; and, indeed, it would appear, that this effect is not heightened by the mixture, but properly obviated by it. There are few exceptions to this, if any, e.g. taking a large proportion of acidulent substances with milk. The coldness, &c. acidity, flatulence, &c. may appear; and it is possible that the coagulum, from the aceticity of the vegetables, being somewhat stronger induced, may give occasion to too long retention in the stomach, and to acidity in too great degree. Again, the mixture of fish and milk often occasions inconveniences. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of this is difficult, though, from universal consent, it must certainly be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a>. Can we suppose that fish gives occasion to such a coagulum as runnet? If it does so, it may produce bad effects. Besides, fishes approach somewhat to vegetables, in giving little stimulus; and are accused of the same bad effects as these, viz. bringing on the cold fit of fever.\n\nThus much may be said for variety. But it also has its disadvantages, provoking to gluttony; this, and the art of cookery, making men take in more than they properly can digest: and hence, perhaps very justly, physicians have universally almost preferred simplicity of diet; for, in spite of rules, man's eating will only be measured by his appetite, and satiety is sooner produced by one than by many substances. But this is so far from being an argument against variety, that it is one for it, as the only way of avoiding a full meal of animal food, and its bad effects, is by presenting a quantity of vegetables. Another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> of preventing the bad effects of animal food, is to take a large proportion of liquid; and hence the bad effects of animal food are less felt in Scotland, on account of their drinking much with it, and using broths, which are at once excellent correctors of animal food and preventives of gluttony.\n\nWith regard to the difference between animal foods, properly so called, the first regards their solubility, depending on a lax or firm texture of their different kinds.\n\nI. Solubility of animal food seems to deserve less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> than is commonly imagined; for there are many instances of persons of a weak stomach incapable of breaking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the texture of vegetables, or even of dissolving a light pudding, to whom hung beef, or a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAM\">ham</a>, was very grateful and easily digested. None of the theories given for the solution of animal food in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> stomach seem to have explained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> sufficiently. Long ago has been discarded the supposition of an active corrosive menstruum there; and also the doctrine of trituration, for which, indeed, there seems no mechanism in the human body; and, till lately, physicians commonly agreed with Boerhaave in supposing nothing more to be necessary than a watery menstruum, moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, and frequent agitation. This will account for solution in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, but not entirely. Let us try to imitate it out of the body with the same circumstances, and in ten times the time in which the food is dissolved in the stomach we shall not be able to bring about the same changes. Take the coagulated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>, which almost every body can easily digest, and yet no artifice shall be able to dissolve it. Hence, then, we are led to seek another cause for solution, viz. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a>; a notion, indeed, formerly embraced, but on the introduction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> philosophy, industriously banished, with every other supposition of that process taking place at all in the animal economy.\n\nMany of the ancients imagined this fermentation to be putrefactive. But this we deny, as an acid is produced; though hence the fermentation might be reckoned the venous, which, however, seems always to be morbid. Neither, indeed, is the fermentation purely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACETOUS\">acetous</a>, but modified by putrefaction; for Pringle has observed, that animal matters raise and even expedite the acetous process. The fermentation, then, in the stomach is of a mixed nature, between the acetous and putrefactive, mutually modifying each other; though, indeed, in the intestines, somewhat of the putrefactive seems to take place, as may be observed from the state of the feces broke down, and from the little disposition of such substances to be so, which are not liable to the putrefactive process, as the firmer parts of vegetables, &c. Upon this view solution seems to be extremely easy, and those substances to be most easily broken down which\nFOO\n\nwhich are most subject to putrefaction. See ANATOMY, and GASTRIC JUICE.\n\nBut solution also depends on other circumstances, and hence requires a more particular regard.\n\n1. There is a difference of solubility with respect to the manducation of animal food, for which bread is extremely necessary, in order to keep the more slippery parts in the mouth till they be properly comminuted. From want of proper manducation persons are subject to eruptions; and this more frequently from the firm vegetable foods, as apples, almonds, &c., than from the animal, though, indeed, even from animal food, very tendinous, or swallowed in unbroken masses, such sometimes occur. Manducation is so much connected with solution, that some, from imperfectly performing that, are obliged to belch up their food, remanducate it, and swallow it again before the stomach can dissolve it, or proper nourishment be extracted. Another proof of our regard to solubility, is our rejecting the firmer parts of animal food, as bull beef, and generally carnivorous animals.\n\n2. Its effects with regard to solubility seem also to be the foundation of our choice between fat and lean, young and old meats. In the lean although perhaps a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIBRE\">fibre</a> might be sufficiently tender, yet these, when collected in fasciculi, are very firm and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a>, and of difficult solution; whereas in the fat there is a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of vessels, a greater quantity of juice, more interposition of cellular substance, and consequently more solubility. Again, in young animals, there is probably the same number of fibres as in the older, but these more connected: whereas, in the older, the growth depending on the separation of these, and the increase of vessels and cellular substance, the texture is less firm and more soluble; which qualities, with regard to the stomach, are at that time too increased, by the increased alkalinity of the animal. To this also may be referred our choice of castrated animals, viz. on account of their disposition to fatten after the operation.\n\n3. It is with a view to the solubility, that we make a choice between meats recently killed, and those which have been kept for some time. As soon as meat is killed, the putrefactive process begins; which commonly we allow to proceed for a little, as that process is the most effectual breaker down of animal matters, and a great afflatus to solution. The length of time during which meat ought to be kept, is proportioned to the meat's tendency to undergo the putrid fermentation, and the degree of those circumstances which favour it: Thus, in the torrid zone, where meat cannot be kept above four or five hours, it is used much more recent than in these northern climates.\n\n4. Boiled or roasted meats create a difference of solution. By boiling we extract the juices interposed between the fibres, approximate them more to each other, and render them of more difficult solubility; which is increased too by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a> of the juices, which are much more alkaline than the fibres: but when we want to avoid the stimulus of alkaline food, and the quick solution, as in some cases of disease, the roasted is not to be chosen. Of roasted meat it may be asked, which are more proper, those which are moist or least roasted? That which is least done is certainly the most soluble: even raw meats are more soluble than dressed, as Dr Cullen was informed by a person who from necessity was obliged, for some time, to eat such. But at the same time that meats little done are very soluble, they are very alkaline; so that, wherever we want to avoid alkalinity in the prime use, the most roasted meats should be chosen. Those who throw away the broths of boiled meat do very improperly; for, besides their supplying a fluid, from their greater alkalinity they increase the solubility of the meat. Here we shall observe, that pure blood has been thought insoluble. Undoubtedly it is very nutritious; and though out of the body, like the white of eggs, it seems very insoluble, yet, like that too, in the body it is commonly easily digested. Moses very properly forbade it the Israelites, as in warm countries it is highly alkaline; and even here, when it was used in great quantity, the scurvy was more frequent: but to a moderate use of it, in these climates, no such objection takes place.\n\n5. Solubility is varied from another source, viz. viscosity of the juice of aliment. Young animals, then, appear more soluble than old, not only on account of the compaction and firmness of texture in the latter, but also their greater viscosity of juice. And nothing is more common, than to be longer oppressed from a full meal of veal, than from the same quantity of beef, &c. Upon account, too, of their greater viscosity of juice, are the tendinous and ligamentous parts of animals longer retained than the purely muscular, as well as on account of their firmness of texture. Even fishes, whose muscular parts are exceedingly tender, are, on account of their gluey viscosity, longer of solution in the stomach. And eggs, too, which are exceedingly nourishing, have the same effect, and cannot be taken in great quantity: For the stomach is peculiarly sensitive to gelatinous substances; and by this means has nature perhaps taught us, as it were by a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a>, to limit ourselves in the quantity of such nutritive substances.\n\n6. With regard to solution, we must take in the oils of animal food; which, when tolerably pure, are the least putrefactive part of it, and, by diminishing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> of the fibres, render them more soluble. On this last account is the lean of fat meat more easily dissolved than other lean. But when the meat is exposed to much heat, this oil is separated, leaving the solid parts less easily soluble, and becoming itself empyreumatic, rancid, and of difficult mixture in the stomach. Fried meats, from the reasons now given, and baked meats, for the same, as well as for the tenacity of the paste, are preparations which diminish the solubility of the food. From what has been said, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of food by fattening it, and keeping it for some time after being killed, although it may administer to gluttony, will yet, it must be confessed, increase the solution of the food.\n\nII. The second difference of animal food is with regard to ALKALINEGENCY.\n\nOf this we have taken a little notice already under the head of Solubility.\n\n1. From their too great alkalinity we commonly avoid the carnivorous animals, and the fer\u00e6; and choose rather the granivorous. Some birds, indeed, which live on insects, are admitted into our food; but\nno man, without nausea, can live upon these alone for any length of time. Fishes, too, are an exception to this rule, living almost universally on each other. But in these the alkaline deficiency does not proceed so far; whether from the viscosity of their juice, their want of heat, or some peculiarity in their economy, is not easy to determine.\n\n2. Alkaline deficiency is determined by difference of age. The older animals are always more alkaline than the young, from their continual progress to putrefaction. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMBERG\">Homberg</a> always found, in his endeavors to extract an acid from human blood, that more was obtained from the young than from the old animals.\n\n3. A third circumstance which varies the alkaline deficiency of the food, is the wildness or tameness of the animal; and this again seems to depend on its exercise. Dr Cullen knew a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> who was fond of cats for food; but he always used to feed them on vegetable food, and kept them from exercise; and in the same manner did the Romans rear up their rats, when intended for food. In the same way the flesh of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTRIDGE\">partridge</a> and the hen seems to be much the same; only, from its being more on the wing, the one is more alkaline than the other. Again, Tame animals are commonly used without their blood; whereas the wild are commonly killed in their blood, and upon that account, as well as their greater exercise, are more alkaline.\n\n4. The alkaline deficiency of food may be determined from the quantity of volatile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> it affords. The older the meat is, it is found to give the greater proportion of volatile salt.\n\n5. The alkaline deficiency of aliment may also, in some measure, be determined from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, the younger animals being whiter and less alkaline. We also take a mark from the colour of the gravy poured out, according to the redness of the juices judging of the animal's alkaline deficiency.\n\n6. The relish of food is found to depend much on its alkaline deficiency, as does also the stimulus it gives and the fever it produces in the system. These effects are also complicated with the viscosity of the food, by which means it is longer detained in the stomach, and the want of alkaline deficiency supplied.\n\nHaving mentioned animal food as differing in solubility and alkaline deficiency, which often go together in the same subject, we come to the third difference, viz.\n\nIII. Quantity of Nutrient. Which is either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> or relative; absolute with respect to the quantity it really contains, sufficient powers being given to extract it; relative, with respect to the assimilatory powers of those who use it. The absolute nutrient is of some consequence; but the relative, in the robust and healthy, and except in cases of extraordinary weakness, may, without much inconvenience, be disregarded. In another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is the quantity of nourishment relative, viz. with regard to its perspiration; for if the food is soon carried off by the excretions, it is the same thing as if it contained a less proportion of nourishment. For, giving more fluid, that which is longer retained affords most; and, for the repair of the solids, that retention also is of advantage. Now, gelatinous substances are long retained; and besides, are themselves animal substances dissolved: so that, both absolutely and relatively, such substances are nutritious. Of this kind are eggs, shell fish, &c. In adults, though it is disputed whether their solids need any repair, yet at any rate, at this period, fluid is more required; for this purpose the alkaline foods are most proper, being most easily dissolved. They are, at the same time, the most perishable; on one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> that alkaline deficiency leading to disease, while on the other their perishability obviates it. Adults, therefore, as writers justly observe, are better nourished on the alkaline; the young and growing, on gelatinous foods. All this leads to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of young and old meats; the first being more gelatinous, and the last more alkaline. This, however, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, is not yet properly ascertained. Mr Geoffroy is the only person who has been taken up with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of foods. See Memoires de l'Academie, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAN\">Pan</a>. 1731 & 1732. His attempt was certainly laudable, and in some respects usefully performed; but, in general, his experiments were not sufficiently repeated, nor are indeed sufficiently accurate. He has not been on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against the various circumstances which affect meats; the cow-kind liking a moist succulent herbage, which is not to be got in warm climates; while the sheep are fond of dry food, and thrive best there. Again, Some of his experiments seem contradictory. He says, that veal gives more solution than beef, while lamb gives less than mutton, which is much to be doubted. If both he and Sanctorius had examined English beef, the result probably would have been very different as to its perspiration, &c. Besides, Mr Geoffroy has only analyzed beef and veal when raw; has made no proper circumstantial comparisons between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a> and birds; and has examined these last along with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>, and not their muscles, &c. by themselves, as he ought to have done, &c. If a set of experiments of this kind were properly and accurately performed, they might be of great use; but at present, for the purpose of determining our present subject, we must have recourse to our alkaline, solubility, &c.\n\nIV. The fourth difference of animal food is, The Nature of the Fluids they afford. The whole of this will be understood from what has been said on alkaline deficiency; the fluid produced being more or less dense and stimulating, in proportion as that prevails.\n\nV. The fifth difference of animal foods is with respect to their\n\nPerspiration. The sum of what can be said on this matter is this, that such foods as promote an accumulation of fluid in our vessels and dispose to plethora, are the least perishable, and commonly give most strength; that the more alkaline foods are the most perishable, though the viscid and less alkaline may attain the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> by long retention in the system. The authors on perspiration have determined the perspiration of foods as imperfectly as Mr Geoffroy has done the solubility, and in a few cases only. We must not lay hold on what Sanctorius has said on the perspiration of mutton, because he has not examined in the same way other meats in their perfect state; far less on what Keil says of oysters, as he himself was a valetudinarian, and consequently an unfit subject for such experiments, and probably of a peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">temperament</a>.\n\nAs to the effects of Food on the Mind, we have already hinted at them above. It is plain, that deli-\ncacy of feeling, liveliness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, quickness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>, and acuteness of judgment, more frequently accompany a weak state of the body. True it is indeed, that the same state is liable to timidity, fluctuation and doubt; while the strong have that steadiness of judgment, and firmness of purpose, which are proper for the higher and more active scenes of life. The most valuable state of the mind, however, appears to reside in somewhat less firmness and vigour of body. Vegetable aliment, as never over-stimulating the vessels or loading the system, never interrupts the stronger motions of the mind; while the heat, fulness, and weight, of animal food, are an enemy to its vigorous efforts. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">Temperance</a>, then, does not so much consist in the quantity, for that always will be regulated by our appetite, as in the quality, viz., a large proportion of vegetable aliment.\n\nA considerable change has now taken place in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> made use of as food by the ancients, by substituting, instead of what were then used, particularly of the vegetable kind, a number of more bland, agreeable, and nutritive juices. The acorns and nuts of the primitive times have given way to a variety of sweeter farinaceous seeds and roots. To the malvaceous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of plants so much used by the Greeks and Romans, hath succeeded the more grateful spinach; and to the bitter, the garden orach. The rough borage is supplanted by the excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SORREL\">sorrel</a>; and asparagus has banished a number of roots recorded by the Roman writers under the name of bulbis; but Linnaeus is of opinion, that the parsnip has undeservedly usurped the place of the skirret. The bean of the ancients, improperly so called, being the roots as well as other parts of the nymphaea melumbo, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> water-lily, is superseded by the kidney bean. The garden rocket, eaten with and as an antidote against the chilling qualities of the lettuce, is banished by the more agreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRESS\">cress</a> and tarragon; the apium by the meliorated celery; the pompion, and others of the cucurbitaceous tribe, by the melon; and the fennel berries, by the fragrant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUTMEG\">nutmeg</a>. The filipium, or succus Cyrenaicus, which the Romans purchased from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> at a great price, and is thought by some to have been the affaecida of the present time, is no longer used in preference to the alliaceous tribe.\n\nTo turn from the vegetable to some of the animal substitutes, we may mention the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARP\">carp</a> among fishes as having excluded a great number held in high estimation among the Romans; the change of oil for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>; of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>; of mulfa, or liquors made of wine, water, and honey, for the wines of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times; and that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> zythus for the present improved malt liquors; not to mention also the Callida of the Roman taverns, analogous to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a> and coffee.\n\nFood of Plants.

On leaving the university, he commenced student of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> in the Temple; but as the dryness of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> the liveliness of his genius, he soon relinquished it. He married a young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> of a good family and some fortune; but their tempers not agreeing, a perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> subsist between them. He now launched into all the fashionable foibles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAMING\">gaming</a> not excepted, and in a few years spent his whole fortune.

He next performed Pendlewife with much more applause; and this, indeed, was ever after one of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> parts.

But as Mr Foote was never a capital <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTOR\">actor</a> in the plays of others, his salary was very unequal to his gay and extravagant turn; and he contracted debts which forced him to take refuge within the verge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>. On this occasion, he relieved his necessities by the following stratagem. Sir Fr\u2014s D\u2014l\u2014l had long been his intimate friend, and had dissipated his fortune by similar extravagance. Lady N\u2014n\u2014P\u2014let, who was likewise an intimate acquaintance of Foote's, and who was exceedingly rich, was fortunately at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> bent upon a matrimonial scheme. Foote strongly recommended to her to consult upon this momentous affair the conjurer in the Old Bailey, whom he represented as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of surprising skill and penetration. He employed an acquaintance of his own to perforate the conjurer; who depicted Sir Fr\u2014s D\u2014l\u2014l at full length; described the time when, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where, and the dress in which she would see him. The lady was so struck with the coincidence of every circumstance, that she married D\u2014l\u2014l in a few days. For this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> Sir Francis settled an annuity upon Foote; and this enabled him once more to emerge from obscurity.\n\nIn 1747 he opened the little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a> in the Haymarket, taking upon himself the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> character of author and performer; and appeared in a dramatic piece of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, called the Divertions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">Morning</a>.

In this performance, a certain physician, Dr L\u2014n, well known for the oddity and singularity of his appearance and conversation, and the celebrated Chevalier Taylor, who was at that time in the height of his popularity, were made objects of Foote's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a>; the latter, indeed, very deservedly; and, in the concluding part of his speech, under the character of a theatrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a>, Mr Foote took off, with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> and accuracy, the several styles of acting of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> performer on the English stage. This performance at first met with some opposition from the civil magistrates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a>, under the sanction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of parliament for limiting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of playhouses, as well as from the jealousy of one of the managers of Drury-lane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PLAYHOUSE\">playhouse</a>; but the author being patronized by many of the principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, and other persons of distinction, this opposition was overruled; and having altered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of his performance, Mr Foote proceeded, without further molestation, to give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">Tea</a> in a Morning to his friends, and represented it through a run of 40 mornings to crowded and splendid audiences.\u2014The ensuing season he produced another piece of the same kind, which he called An Auction of Pictures. In this performance he introduced several new and popular characters; particularly Sir Thomas de Veil, then the acting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> of peace for Westminster, Mr Cock the celebrated auctioneer, and the equally famous Orator Henley. This piece also had a very great run.\u2014His Knights, which was the produce of the ensuing season, was a performance of somewhat more dramatic regularity: but still, although his plot and characters seemed less immediately <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a>, it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> that he kept some particular real persons strongly in his eye in the performance; and the town took upon themselves to fix them where the resemblance appeared to be the most striking. Thus Mr Foote <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> from time to time to select, for the entertainment of the public, such characters, as well general as individual, as seemed most likely to engage their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. His dramatic pieces, exclusive of the interlude called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">Piety</a> in Patterns, are as follow: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">Taste</a>, the Knights, The Author, The Englishman in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, The Englishman returned from Paris, The Mayor of Garrat, The Liar, The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">Patron</a>, The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a>, The Orators, The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSARY\">Commissary</a>,\nCommissary, The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVIL\">Devil</a> upon Two Sticks, The Lame Lover, The Maid of Bath, The Nabob, The Cozeners, The Capuchin, The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BANKRUPT\">Bankrupt</a>, and an unfinished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMEDY\">comedy</a> called The Slanderer. All these works are only to be ranked among the petticoat pieces of the theatre. In the execution they are somewhat loose, negligent, and unfinished; the plots are often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>, and the catastrophes not always conclusive: but, with all these deficiencies, they contain more strength of character, more strokes of keen satire, and more touches of temporary humour, than are to be found in the writings of any other modern dramatist. Even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> spoken by his characters, incorrect as it may sometimes seem, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> on a closer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> be found entirely dramatical; as it abounds with those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> of expression which frequently form the very basis of character, and which render it the truest mirror of the conversation of the times in which he wrote.\n\nIn the year 1766, being on a party of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> with the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, Lord Mexborough, and Sir Francis Delaval, Mr Foote had the misfortune to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> his leg, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>; in consequence of which, he was compelled to undergo an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMPUTATION\">amputation</a>. This accident so sensibly affected the duke, that he made a point of obtaining for Mr Foote a patent for life; whereby he was allowed to perform, at the little theatre in the Haymarket, from the 15th of May to the 15th of September every year.\n\nHe now became a greater favourite of the town than ever: his very laughable pieces, with his more laughable performance, constantly filled his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>; and his receipts were some seasons almost incredible. Parsimony was never a vice to be ascribed to Mr Foote; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a> and generosity were ever conspicuous; he was visited by the first nobility, and he was sometimes honoured even by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> guests.\n\nThe attack made upon his character by one of his domestics, whom he had dismissed for misbehaviour, is too well known to be particularized here. Suffice it to say, he was honourably acquitted of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>: but it is believed by some, that the shock which he received from it accelerated his death; others pretend, that his literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERCATION\">altercation</a> with a certain then duchess, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> rather her agents, much affected him, and that from that time his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> declined. It is probable, however, that his natural volatility of spirits could scarcely fail to support him against all impressions from either of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>.\n\nMr Foote, finding his health decline, entered into an agreement with Mr Colman, for his patent of the theatre; according to which, he was to receive from Mr Colman, \u00a3600 per annum, besides a stipulated sum whenever he chose to perform. Mr Foote made his appearance two or three times in some of the most admired characters; but, being suddenly affected with a paralytic stroke one night whilst upon the stage, he was compelled to retire. He was advised to bathe; and accordingly repaired to Brighthelmstone, where he apparently recovered his former health and spirits, and was what is called the fiddle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> who resorted to that agreeable place of amusement. A few weeks before his death, he returned to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>; but, by the advice of his physicians, set out with an intention to spend the winter at Paris and in the south of France. He had got <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> farther than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a>, when he was suddenly attacked by another stroke of the palsy, which in a few hours terminated his existence. He died on the 21st of October 1777, in the 56th year of his age, and was privately interred in the cloisters of Westminster <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a>.","sp":423,"ep":424},{"h":"FORAMEN","t":"in Anatomy, a name given to several apertures <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> perforations in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> parts of the body; as, 1.

In his early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, he was brought up in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> remarkable for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a>; which, perhaps, led him afterwards to a freer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> in social pleasures. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> disposition inclined him to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>; but, as he soon discovered a superior genius, by the advice of his friends he applied himself to letters. He directed his studies particularly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CIVIL_LAW\">civil <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>; in which he made a quick progress, and in 1709 was admitted an advocate. From 1722 to 1737, he represented in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> the boroughs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERNESS\">Inverness</a>, Fortrose, Nairn, and Forres. In 1725, he was made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s advocate; and lord president of the court of session in 1737. In the rebellions which broke out in Scotland in 1715 and 1745 he espoused the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> cause; but with so much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and moderation did he conduct himself at this delicate conjuncture, that not a whisper was at any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> heard to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> he acquired in advancing the prosperity of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and in contributing to re-establish peace and order, was the only reward of his services. He had even impaired, and almost ruined, his private fortune in the cause of the public: but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> did not make him the smallest recompense. The minister, with a meanness for which it is difficult to account, desired to have a state of his disbursements. Shocked at the incivility and rudeness of this treatment, he left the minister without making any reply. Throughout the whole course of his life he had a lively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, without the least taint of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>; and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> was extended to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> and denomination of religionists indiscriminately. He was well versed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>; and wrote in a flowing and oratorical style, concerning religion natural and revealed, some important discoveries in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, and concerning the sources of incredulity.

While a body remains in the same state, either of rest or of uniform and rectilinear motion, the cause of its remaining in such a state is in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the body, and it cannot be said that any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRINSIC\">extrinsic</a> force has acted on it. This internal cause or principle is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INERTIA\">inertia</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">Mechanical</a> forces may be reduced to two sorts: one of a body at rest, the other of a body in motion.\n\nThe force of a body at rest, is that which we conceive to be in a body lying still on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, or hanging by a rope, or supported by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, &c. and this is called by the names of preflure, tension, force, or vis mortua, solicitatio, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONATUS\">conatus</a> movendi, conamen, &c. To this class also of forces we must refer centripetal and centrifugal forces, though they reside in a body in motion; because these forces are homogeneous to weights, preflures, or tensions of any kind.\n\nThe force of a body in motion is a power residing in that body so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as it continues its motion; by means of which it is able to remove obstacles lying in its way; to lessen, destroy, or overcome the force of any other moving body which meets it in an opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>; or to surmount any dead preflure or resistance, as tensity, gravity, friction, &c. for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; but which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be lessened or destroyed by such resistance as lessens or destroys the motion of the body. This is called moving force, vis motrix, and by some late writers vis viva, to distinguish it from the vis mortua spoken of before; and by these appellations, however different, the same thing is understood by all mathematicians; namely, that power of displacing, of withstanding opposite moving forces, or of overcoming any dead resistance, which resides in a moving body, and which, in whole or in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>, continues to accompany it, so long as the body moves. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">Mechanics</a>.\n\nWe have several curious as well as useful observations in Defaguliers's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXPERIMENTAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Experimental Philosophy</a>, concerning the comparative forces of men and horses, and the best way of applying them. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> draws with the greatest advantage when the line of direction is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>; in such a situation, he is able to draw 200lb. eight hours a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, walking about two miles and a half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>. And <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the same horse is made to draw 240lb., he can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> but six hours a-day, and cannot go quite so fast. On a carriage, indeed where friction alone is to be overcome, a middling horse will draw 1000lb. But the best way to try a horse's force, is by making him draw up out of a well, over a single pulley or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROLLER\">roller</a>; and, in such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, one horse with another will draw 200lb. as already observed.\n\nFive men are found to be equal in strength to one horse, and can, with as much ease, push round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> beam of a mill, in a walk 40 feet wide; whereas three men will do it in a walk only 19 feet wide.\n\nThe worst way of applying the force of a horse, is to make him carry or draw up hill: for if the hill be steep, three men will do more than a horse, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> climbing up faster with a burden of 100lb. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, than a horse that is loaded with 300lb.; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> which is owing to the position of the parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> body being better adapted to climb than those of a horse.\n\nOn the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the best way of applying the force of a horse, is in a horizontal direction, wherein a man can exert least force; thus a man weighing 140lb. and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> along by means of a rope coming over his shoulders, cannot draw above 27lb. or exert above one seventh part of the force of a horse employed to the same purpose.\n\nThe very best and most effectual posture in a man, is that of rowing, in which he not only acts with more muscles at once for overcoming the resistance, than in any other position; but as he pulls backward, the weight of his body assists by way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a>. See Defaguliers, Exp. Phil. vol. i. p. 241, where we have several other observations relative to force acquired by certain positions of the body, from which that author accounts for most feats of strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>.

Sc. 1629; or in Defaguliers, Exp. &c. 267, &c. who has published a translation of part of it, with remarks.\n\nCitizen Regnier has invented an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> for ascertaining the relative strength of men and animals, for an account of which, see Dynamometer; and for a fuller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>, the reader may consult the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on the subject in Journal de l'Ecole Polytechn., vol. ii. or the translation in Phil.

But this last quantity, when expanded into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> by the binomial theorem (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALGEBRA\">Algebra</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>.

Multiply the fluxion of the variable quantity itself by the exponent of the power, and by a power of the quantity whose exponent is less by unity than the given exponent, and the product will be the fluxion required.\n\n(b) We are here to be understood to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> the ratio of the numerical values of the increments, which may always be compared with each other, whether the variable quantities be of the same kind, as both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, or both surfaces, &c., or of different kinds, as the one a line, and the other a surface.\n27. In determining the limit of the ratio of the simultaneous increments of \\( x \\) and \\( x^n \\), we have referred to the binomial theorem, but the only application we have had occasion to make of that theorem was to determine the numeral coefficient of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of the development of \\((x + h)^n\\), when \\( n \\) is supposed to be any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> whatever, which is an inquiry of a more simple nature than the general investigation of the theorem. We shall now show how that coefficient may be deduced from the first principles of algebra. Thus the investigation of the fluxion of \\( x^n \\) will be rendered independent of the general demonstration of the binomial theorem; and we shall hereafter show that the theorem itself is easily investigated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUXIONS\">fluxions</a>.\n\n28. Since \\( x + h \\) is equal to \\( x(1 + \\frac{h}{x}) \\) it follows that \\((x + h)^n = x^n (1 + \\frac{h}{x})^n\\), thus the development of \\((x + h)^n\\) is reduced to that of \\((1 + \\frac{h}{x})^n\\), or putting \\( \\frac{h}{x} = v \\), to \\((1 + v)^n\\). Now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we give particular values to \\( n \\), and suppose it to be 1, 2, 3, &c. or \u20141, \u20142, &c. or lastly \\( \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\) &c. we can find the series that expresses the powers of \\( 1 + v \\), whose exponents are those numbers, by the operations of multiplication, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVOLUTION\">evolution</a>, and in every particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> we shall find, that the powers of \\( 1 + v \\) are expressed by a series of this form,\n\n\\[ 1 + A v + B v^2 + C v^3 + D v^4 + &c. \\]\n\nWhere \\( A, B, C, D, \\) &c. denote numeral coefficients which depend for their value only on \\( n \\) the exponent of the power, and not on the quantity \\( v \\); and as the form of the series will be found to be the same whatever particular values we may give to the exponent, we may conclude that it is the same, whether the exponent be positive or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>, whole or fractional.\n\n29. First let us suppose that the exponent is a whole positive number, then, because\n\n\\[ (1 + v)^n = 1 + A v + B v^2 + &c. \\]\n\nif we multiply both sides of this equation by \\( 1 + v \\), and collect together the like powers of \\( v \\), it will appear that\n\n\\[ (1 + v)^{n+1} = 1 + A' v + B' v^2 + &c. \\]\n\nHence it appears that the coefficient of the second term of any power of \\( 1 + v \\) exceeds that of the next less power by unity. Now in the case of the first power of \\( 1 + v \\), the coefficient of the second term is obviously 1, therefore, in the second power it is 2, in the third power 3, and universally, in the \\( n \\)th power it is \\( n \\); so that \\( n \\) being a whole positive number,\n\n\\[ (1 + v)^n = 1 + n v + &c. \\]\n\n30. Let us next suppose the exponent to be a fraction denoted by \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\), so that\n\n\\[ (1 + v)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = 1 + A v + B v^2 + &c. \\]\n\nLet both sides of this equation be raised to the power \\( n \\), having first substituted \\( M v \\) for \\( A v + B v^2 + &c. \\), then\n\n\\[ (1 + v)^m = (1 + M v)^n. \\]\n\nNow as we have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> found that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) being integers,\n\n\\[ (1 + v)^m = 1 + m v + &c. \\]\nand \\((1 + M v)^n = 1 + n M v + &c.\\)\n\nHere we stop at the second term, that being the only one whose coefficient is required. Substitute now for \\( M v \\) its value \\( A v + &c. \\), then, stopping again at the second term, we get\n\n\\[ (1 + M v)^n = 1 + n A v + &c. \\]\n\ntherefore,\n\n\\[ 1 + m v + &c. = 1 + n A v + &c. \\]\n\nand making the coefficients of \\( v \\) in each series equal to each other,\n\n\\[ n A = m, \\text{ and } A = \\frac{m}{n}. \\]\n\n31. In the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> let us suppose that the exponent is a negative quantity either whole or fractional, so that\n\n\\[ (1 + v)^{-\\frac{m}{n}} = 1 + A' v + B' v^2 + &c. \\]\n\nor\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{(1 + v)^{\\frac{m}{n}}} = 1 + A' v + B' v^2 + &c. \\]\n\nthen, multiplying both sides by \\((1 + v)^{\\frac{m}{n}}\\) we get\n\n\\[ 1 = (1 + v)^{\\frac{m}{n}}(1 + A' v + B' v^2 + &c.) \\]\n\nor, substituting \\( 1 + A v + B v^2 + &c. \\) for \\((1 + v)^{\\frac{m}{n}}\\) and actually multiplying the two series,\n\n\\[ 1 = 1 + A \\left\\{ \\begin{<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARRAY\">array</a>}{c} v \\\\ + A' \\end{array} \\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>\\} v + B \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{c} v^2 \\\\ + A' \\end{array} \\right\\} v^2 + &c. \\]\n\nNow that this equation may subsist, whatever be the value of \\( v \\), it is necessary that\n\n\\[ A + A' = 0, \\]\n\\[ B + A' + B' = 0, \\]\n&c.\n\nand by these equations we may determine \\( A', B', C', \\) &c. It is however only required at present to find the first of these, viz \\( A' \\); now we have \\( A' = -A \\); but \\( A \\) being the coefficient of the second term of the series expressing \\((1 + v)^{\\frac{m}{n}}\\), the exponent of which is positive, we have already found it to be \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\), therefore, \\( A' = -\\frac{m}{n} \\).\n\n32. As we have found that the coefficients of the second term of the developments of \\((1 + v)^n\\), \\((1 + v)^{\\frac{m}{n}}\\) and \\((1 + v)^{-\\frac{m}{n}}\\) are \\( m, \\frac{m}{n}, \\) and \\(-\\frac{m}{n} \\) respectively, it appears that whatever be the number denoted by \\( n \\), the two first terms of the series expressing \\((1 + v)^n\\) are \\( 1 + n v \\), and therefore, substituting for \\( v \\) its value \\( \\frac{h}{x} \\), and multiplying by \\( x^n \\), the two first terms of the series expressing \\((x + h)^n\\) are \\( x^n + nx^{n-1}h \\), agreeing with what we have\n33. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of reasoning employed to determine the ratio of the fluxions of \\( u \\) and \\( x \\), when the former is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of the latter of the form \\( x^n \\), will apply equally when the function has any other assigned form. But instead of investigating in this manner the fluxion of every particular function, it is better to consider a complex function as the sum, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>, or product or quotient, &c. of other simple functions, and to investigate rules for each of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, supposing that the fluxions of the simple functions are previously known.\n\n34. Let us first suppose that \\( u \\), a function of a variable quantity \\( x \\), is equal to the sum of \\( v \\) and \\( w \\), two other functions of \\( x \\). It is required to find the fluxion of \\( u \\), having given the fluxions of \\( v \\) and \\( w \\).\n\nLet \\( x \\) be conceived to change its value, and to become \\( x + h \\), then, as \\( v \\) and \\( w \\) will also change their values, \u00a7 11, the one to\n\n\\[\nv' = v + p'h + q'h^2 + r'h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nand the other to\n\n\\[\nw' = w + p'h + q'h^2 + r'h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nif \\( u' \\) as usual denote the corresponding new value of \\( u \\), we have\n\n\\[\nu' = v' + w'\n\\]\n\n\\[\nu' = \\{ v + p'h + q'h^2 + \\&c. \\}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nu' = \\{ w + p'h + q'h^2 + \\&c. \\}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nu' = (p + p')h + (q + q')h^2 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nIf we now conceive \\( h \\) to be continually diminished, we shall have the limit of \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\) expressed by \\( p + p' \\). But \\( p \\) is the limit of \\( \\frac{v' - v}{h} \\), \u00a7 14, and in like manner \\( p' \\) is the limit of \\( \\frac{w' - w}{h} \\), therefore,\n\n\\[\n\\text{limit of } \\frac{u' - u}{h} = \\text{limit of } \\frac{v' - v}{h} + \\text{limit of } \\frac{w' - w}{h}.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute now the ratio of the fluxions instead of the limiting ratios, and we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} = \\frac{\\dot{v}}{x} + \\frac{\\dot{w}}{x};\n\\]\n\ntherefore, \\( \\dot{u} = \\dot{v} + \\dot{w} \\).\n\n35. If we suppose \\( s \\) to be a function of \\( x \\), and \\( u, v, w, \\&c. \\) other functions of \\( x \\), such that\n\n\\[\ns = au + bv + cw + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a, b, c \\), denote any given numbers, positive or negative, then, by reasoning as above, it is evident that\n\n\\[\n\\dot{s} = a\\dot{u} + b\\dot{v} + c\\dot{w} + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, to find the fluxion of the sum of any number of functions, each multiplied by a constant quantity. Multiply the fluxion of each function by its constant coefficient, and the sum of the products is the fluxion required.\n\n36. If \\( c \\) denote a constant quantity, and \\( u, v \\), be functions of \\( x \\), such that \\( u = c + v \\); then \\( x \\) being supposed to become \\( x + h \\), and consequently \\( v \\) to become \\( v' \\), or \\( v + p'h + q'h^2 + \\&c. \\) and \\( c + v \\) to become \\( c + v' + p'h + q'h^2 + \\&c. \\) we have\n\n\\[\nu = c + v,\n\\]\n\nand hence \\( u' = c + v' + p'h + q'h^2 + \\&c. \\)\n\nor \\( u' = u + v' - v \\),\n\ntherefore, \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} = \\frac{v' - v}{h} \\),\n\nand these ratios being always equal, their limits must also be equal; therefore, substituting for the limiting ratios those of the fluxions, we have \\( \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} = \\frac{\\dot{v}}{x} \\) and \\( \\dot{u} = \\dot{v} \\); that is to say, the fluxion of \\( c + v \\) is \\( \\dot{v} \\), from which it appears, That the fluxion of any variable function is the very same as the fluxion of the same function, increased or diminished by any constant quantity. This is a remark of great importance in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of fluxions, as will appear hereafter.\n\n37. Let us now suppose that \\( u, v, w \\), are functions of \\( x \\), such that \\( u = vw \\), it is required to find the fluxion of \\( u \\), supposing the fluxions of \\( v \\) and \\( w \\) to be given.\n\nBy supposing that \\( x, u, v \\) and \\( w \\) change their values as usual, we have\n\n\\[\nu = vw\n\\]\n\n\\[\nu' = (v + p'h + q'h^2 + \\&c.) (w + p'h + q'h^2 + \\&c.)\n\\]\n\nand this last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> by multiplication becomes\n\n\\[\nu' = vw + vp'h + vq'h^2 + wp'h + wp'h^2 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\ntherefore\n\n\\[\nu' - u = (vp' + wp')h + (vq' + wp')h^2 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\ndividing now by \\( h \\), and taking the limit of \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\), we have that limit expressed by \\( vp' + wp' \\); but \\( p' \\) is the limit of \\( \\frac{v' - v}{h} \\), \u00a7 14, and in like manner \\( p \\) is the limit of \\( \\frac{w' - w}{h} \\); therefore\n\n(c) In this investigation we have supposed \\( n \\) to be a rational number. If, however, it were irrational, still the result would be the same; for, corresponding to every such number, two rational numbers, one greater, and the other less than it, may be found, which shall differ from each other by less than any assignable quantity. Therefore, the general properties of these numbers must belong also to the irrational number which is their limit.\nthe limit of \\( \\frac{u'}{h} = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l}\nv \\times \\text{limit of } \\frac{w' - w}{h} \\\\\n+w \\times \\text{limit of } \\frac{v' - v}{h}\n\\end{array} \\right. \\);\n\nHence, by substituting for the limiting ratios the ratios of the fluxions, we have\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} = \\frac{v \\dot{w}}{x} + \\frac{w \\dot{v}}{x} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\dot{u} = v \\dot{w} + w \\dot{v}. \\]\n\nTherefore, to find the fluxion of the product of any two functions, multiply the fluxion of each function by the other function, and the sum of these products is the fluxion required.\n\n38. We have just now seen that when\n\n\\[ u = v w \\]\n\nthen\n\n\\[ \\dot{u} = w \\dot{v} + v \\dot{w}. \\]\n\nLet each side of the latter equation be divided by the corresponding side of the former, thus we get\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{u}}{u} = \\frac{\\dot{v}}{v} + \\frac{\\dot{w}}{w}, \\]\n\nsuppose now that the function \\( w \\) is the product of two other functions \\( s, t \\), so that\n\n\\[ u = v s t, \\]\n\nthen, because \\( w = s t \\), from what has been shewn it follows that \\( \\frac{\\dot{w}}{w} = \\frac{\\dot{s}}{s} + \\frac{\\dot{t}}{t} \\); therefore, substituting this value of \\( \\frac{\\dot{w}}{w} \\) in the equation \\( \\frac{\\dot{u}}{u} = \\frac{\\dot{v}}{v} + \\frac{\\dot{w}}{w} \\), it becomes\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{u}}{u} = \\frac{\\dot{v}}{v} + \\frac{\\dot{s}}{s} + \\frac{\\dot{t}}{t}. \\]\n\nIn general, if we suppose that\n\n\\[ u = v s t r &c. \\]\n\nby reasoning as above it will be found that\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{u}}{u} = \\frac{\\dot{v}}{v} + \\frac{\\dot{s}}{s} + \\frac{\\dot{t}}{t} + \\frac{\\dot{r}}{r} + &c. \\]\n\nwhatever be the number of factors.\n\nSuppose the number of factors to be three, so that\n\n\\[ u = v s t, \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{u}}{u} = \\frac{\\dot{v}}{v} + \\frac{\\dot{s}}{s} + \\frac{\\dot{t}}{t}, \\]\n\nthen substituting \\( v s t \\) for \\( u \\) in this last equation, and taking away the denominators, we find\n\n\\[ \\dot{u} = \\dot{v} \\dot{s} \\dot{t} + v \\dot{s} \\dot{t} + v s \\dot{t}. \\]\n\nAnd as a similar result will be found, whatever be the number of factors, we may conclude that The fluxion of the product of any number of functions is equal to the sum of the products of the fluxion of each function by all the other functions.\n\n39. Let us in the last place suppose that \\( u = \\frac{v}{w} \\), and that it is required to find the fluxion of \\( u \\), having given the fluxions of \\( v \\) and \\( w \\).\n\nFrom the given equation we have \\( v = w u \\), and therefore (\u00a7 37.) \\( \\dot{v} = w \\dot{u} + u \\dot{w} \\), let \\( \\frac{v}{w} \\) be substituted for \\( u \\) in this equation, and it becomes \\( \\dot{v} = w \\dot{u} + \\frac{v \\dot{w}}{w} \\), from which we easily obtain\n\n\\[ \\dot{u} = \\frac{w \\dot{v} - v \\dot{w}}{w^2}. \\]\n\nHence we have the following rule for finding the fluxion of a fraction.\n\nMultiply the fluxion of the numerator by the denominator, and from the product subtract the fluxion of the denominator multiplied by the numerator, and divide the remainder by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the denominator; the result is the fluxion required.\n\n40. It will now be proper to shew the application of these general rules for determining the fluxions of variable functions to some particular examples.\n\nExample 1. Suppose \\( u = a + b \\sqrt{x} - \\frac{c}{x} \\). Required the fluxion of \\( u \\).\n\nHere \\( a \\) being a constant quantity, the fluxion of \\( a + b \\sqrt{x} - \\frac{c}{x} \\) is the same as the fluxion of \\( b \\sqrt{x} - \\frac{c}{x} \\), \u00a7 36, or \\( b x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} - c x^{-1} \\). Now, by \u00a7 26 the fluxion of \\( x^n \\) is \\( \\frac{n}{2} x^{n-1} \\), which expression is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to \\( \\frac{b}{2 \\sqrt{x}} \\), or to \\( \\frac{b}{2 \\sqrt{x}} \\), and in like manner the fluxion of \\( x^{-1} \\) is \\( -x^{-2} \\), or \\( -x^{-2} \\), or \\( -x^{-2} \\), therefore, multiplying the fluxion of \\( x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\) by \\( b \\), and the fluxion of \\( x^{-1} \\) by \\( c \\), and taking the sum of the products, agreeably to the rule in \u00a7 35, we have\n\n\\[ \\dot{u} = \\frac{b}{2 \\sqrt{x}} + \\frac{c}{x^2} \\]\n\nor \\( \\dot{u} = \\left( \\frac{b}{2 \\sqrt{x}} + \\frac{c}{x^2} \\right) x. \\)\n\nEx. 2.

Let us then put \\( a + bx^m \\) equal to \\( v \\), and thus the proposed equation becomes \\( u = v^n \\); then, \\( u \\) being considered as a function of \\( v \\), we have by \u00a7 26,\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = n \\dot{v}^{n-1} \\dot{v}.\n\\]\n\nAgain, \\( v \\) being considered as a function of \\( x \\), from the equation \\( v = a + bx^m \\), we find by \u00a7 36, and \u00a7 26, \\( \\dot{v} = m b x^{m-1} \\dot{x} \\); let this value of \\( \\dot{v} \\) be substituted in the expression for \\( \\dot{u} \\), and it becomes\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = mn b x^{m-1} \\dot{x},\n\\]\n\nwhich, by substituting for \\( v \\) its value \\( a + bx^m \\), is also\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = mn b x^{m-1} (a + bx^m)^{n-1} \\dot{x}.\n\\]\n\nEx. 4. Suppose \\( u = \\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)} \\).\n\nHere we are to proceed as in the last example, and first put \\( a^2 - x^2 = v \\), then \\( u = \\sqrt{v} \\); and therefore\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{\\dot{v}}{2 \\sqrt{v}}.\n\\]\n\nAgain, since \\( v = a^2 - x^2 \\), by \u00a7 26, we find \\( \\dot{v} = -2x \\dot{x} \\). Substitute this value of \\( \\dot{v} \\) in the expression for \\( \\dot{u} \\), and we have\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{-2x \\dot{x}}{2 \\sqrt{v}},\n\\]\n\nwhich, by restoring \\( \\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)} \\) for \\( v \\), and leaving out the number <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to the numerator and denominator, becomes\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{-x \\dot{x}}{\\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)}}.\n\\]\n\nEx. 5.

Therefore, multiplying the fluxion of each function by the product of the other two functions, and taking the sum of all these products, we find\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\left( \\frac{(a^2 + x^2) \\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)}}{2} \\right) \\dot{x} + \\left( \\frac{x^2 (a^2 + x^2)}{\\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)}} \\right) \\dot{x}.\n\\]\n\nEx. 7.

Thus if the function was \\( ax^4 \\), we should have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\dot{u} &= ax^4, \\\\\n\\dot{u} &= 4ax^3 = p, \\\\\n\\dot{p} &= 4.3ax^2 = q, \\\\\n\\dot{q} &= 4.3.2ax = r, \\\\\n\\dot{r} &= 4.3.2.1.a = 24a.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHere the expression for \\( \\frac{\\dot{r}}{x} \\) is a constant quantity, which has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> fluxion.\n\nHence it appears, that relatively to any function of a variable quantity, there exists a series of limiting ratios, deducible from that function, and from each other, by a repetition of the operation of finding the fluxion of a variable function.\n\n42. In treating of the fluxion of a function, we have hitherto regarded the fluxion of the variable quantity \\( x \\), from which the function is formed, merely as one of the terms of a ratio, without considering whether it was a constant or a variable quantity.\n\nNow as we may assume any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> respecting the nature of the fluxion of \\( x \\), that is not inconsistent with what has been already delivered, we shall suppose it to be constant. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a>, if we consider the fluxions of variable quantities as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of their respective velocities, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a> of increase, is in effect the same thing as to suppose that the variable quantity \\( x \\) increases uniformly. Then, as in the expressions\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} = p, \\quad \\frac{\\dot{p}}{x} = q, \\quad \\frac{\\dot{q}}{x} = r, \\quad \\&c.\n\\]\n\nor these others, which follow from them,\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = p \\dot{x}, \\quad \\dot{p} = q \\dot{x}, \\quad \\dot{q} = r \\dot{x}, \\quad \\&c.\n\\]\n\nthe symbol \\( \\dot{x} \\) is to be understood as denoting a constant quantity, it follows that if \\( p \\) be variable, then \\( p \\dot{x} \\), or \\( \\dot{u} \\) will be variable; and if \\( q \\) be variable, then \\( q \\dot{x} \\), or \\( \\dot{p} \\), will...\nLet us now recur to the relation in which the succeeding functions \\( p, q, r, \\) &c., stand to the original function \\( u \\).\n\nBy performing that particular analytical operation upon the function \\( u \\), which consists in finding its fluxion, we obtain \\( p \\dot{x} \\) as the expression for its fluxion, that is, we get \\( u = p \\dot{x} \\); and by repeating the operation on the function \\( p \\), we get \\( p = q \\dot{x} \\); and therefore \\( p \\dot{x} = q \\dot{x}^2 \\); but, \\( x \\) being regarded as a constant quantity, \\( p \\dot{x} \\) is deduced from \\( p \\dot{x} \\), considered as a function of \\( x \\), just in the same manner as \\( p \\dot{x} \\) is derived from the original function \\( u \\); therefore the expression \\( q \\dot{x}^2 \\) is deduced from the function \\( u \\) by performing the operation of taking the fluxion twice; that is, first upon the function \\( u \\) itself, and then upon \\( u \\), or \\( p \\dot{x} \\), the expression for its fluxion; and in this second operation \\( \\dot{x} \\) (or the fluxion of the quantity from which the function is formed) is considered as a constant quantity.\n\nThe expression \\( q \\dot{x}^2 \\), obtained in this manner from the function \\( u \\), is called the second fluxion of the function; and to express its relation to the function \\( u \\), it is denoted by \\( u \\), that is, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> denoting the function itself with two dots over it. Thus, like as \\( u = p \\dot{x} \\), we have\n\n\\[\nu = q \\dot{x}^2, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\ddot{u} = q.\n\\]\n\nAgain, since \\( q = r \\dot{x} \\), it follows that \\( q \\dot{x}^2 = r \\dot{x}^3 \\); but, as \\( x \\) is constant, \\( q \\dot{x}^2 \\) is derived from \\( q \\dot{x} \\), by the operation of finding its fluxion, considering it as a function of \\( x \\), just in the same manner as \\( q \\dot{x}^2 \\), or \\( u \\), is derived from \\( p \\dot{x} \\), or \\( u \\), and in the same manner as \\( u \\) is derived from the original function \\( u \\); therefore, like as \\( p \\dot{x} \\) or \\( u \\) is the first fluxion of the function, and \\( q \\dot{x}^2 \\) or \\( u \\) is its second fluxion, so \\( r \\dot{x}^3 \\) is called its third fluxion, and is denoted by \\( \\ddot{u} \\), that is by the letter expressing the function itself, having three dots placed over it, so that\n\n\\[\n\\ddot{u} = r \\dot{x}^3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\ddot{\\ddot{u}} = r.\n\\]\n\nThe fourth fluxion of a variable function \\( u \\) is denoted by \\( \\ddot{\\ddot{u}} \\), that is by the letter \\( u \\) with four dots over it, and is derived from the third fluxion, in the same manner as the third is derived from the second, or the second from the first, or the first fluxion from the variable function itself; observing, that in repeating the operation of taking the fluxions, the symbol \\( x \\) (or the fluxion of the variable quantity from which the function is formed) is considered as a constant quantity. And the same mode of notation and deduction is to be understood as applying to a fluxion of any order whatever of a variable function.\n\nTo illustrate what has been said respecting the second and higher orders of fluxions of a function, let us suppose \\( u \\) to denote the particular function \\( a x^n \\); then, proceeding agreeably to what has been laid down in last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>, we obtain, by the rule for finding the fluxion of any power of a variable quantity (\\$ 26)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\dot{u} &= n a x^{n-1} \\dot{x}, \\\\\n\\ddot{u} &= n(n-1) a x^{n-2} \\dot{x}^2, \\\\\n\\ddot{\\ddot{u}} &= n(n-1)(n-2) a x^{n-3} \\dot{x}^3, \\\\\n\\ddot{\\ddot{\\ddot{u}}} &= n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) a x^{n-4} \\dot{x}^4, \\quad \\text{&c.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHere we have exhibited the first, second, third, and fourth fluxions of the function \\( a x^n \\); the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of continuation is obvious, and it appears that when \\( n \\) is any positive integer, the function \\( a x^n \\) will have as many orders of fluxions, as there are units in \\( n \\), and no more; for if \\( n \\) were supposed \\( = 3 \\), then, as the fourth fluxion, and all the subsequent ones, are multiplied by \\( n-3 \\), or in that case by \\( 3-3=0 \\), they consequently would vanish, and a similar observation may be made when \\( n \\) is any other whole positive number.\n\nThat we might be able to apply the rules of \\$ 26, \u00a7 34, &c. to the determination of the fluxion of a complex function of a variable quantity, we have found it convenient in some cases to consider such a function as composed of other more simple functions of the same quantity, and we have expressed its fluxion by means of the fluxions of those other functions. In finding the fluxion of any higher order than the first of such a complex function by those rules, we must keep in mind, that it is only the fluxion of \\( x \\), the variable quantity from which the functions are all formed, that is to be considered as constant, and that the fluxions of the functions themselves are in general variable quantities; so that each of them may have a second, third, &c. fluxion, as well as the function which is composed of them.\n\nLet us suppose for example, that\n\n\\[\nu = \\sqrt{(a^2 + x^2)};\n\\]\n\nthen, considering \\( a^2 + x^2 \\) as a function of \\( x \\), and putting \\( v \\) to denote it, we have \\( u = \\sqrt{v} = v^{1/2} \\), and \\( \\dot{u} = \\frac{1}{2} v^{-1/2} \\dot{v} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\dot{v}}{\\sqrt{v}} \\); but since \\( v = a^2 + x^2 \\), it follows that \\( \\dot{v} = 2x \\); therefore, substituting for \\( v \\) and \\( \\dot{v} \\) their respective values, we have\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(a^2 + x^2)}}.\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the second fluxion of \\( u \\), we may either take the fluxion of this last expression, viz. \\( \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(a^2 + x^2)}} \\), and consider the symbol \\( x \\), which is found in it, as denoting a constant quantity; or we may recur to the equation \\( \\dot{u} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\dot{v}}{\\sqrt{v}} \\) and take the fluxion of this other expression for \\( u \\); and in this case, we must consider that both \\( v \\) and \\( \\dot{v} \\) denote variable functions of \\( x \\), and therefore that the fluxion of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\dot{v}}{\\sqrt{v}} \\) may be found by the rule\nfor finding the fluxion of a function; observing that \\( \\dot{v} \\) is to be substituted as the fluxion of \\( v \\). Accordingly, proceeding by this last method, and considering that the fluxion of \\( \\sqrt{v} \\) the denominator of the fraction is \\( \\frac{\\dot{v}}{\\sqrt{v}} \\), we find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\dot{u} &= \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{v} \\cdot \\dot{v} - \\frac{3}{4} \\frac{\\dot{v}^2}{\\sqrt{v}}, \\\\\n&= \\frac{2}{4} \\frac{\\dot{v}^2}{\\sqrt{v}}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNow from the equation \\( v = a + x^2 \\), we have \\( \\dot{v} = 2x \\dot{x} \\), and (observing that \\( x \\) is constant) \\( \\ddot{v} = 2x^2 \\). Let these values of \\( v, \\dot{v}, \\ddot{v} \\), be now substituted in the expression for \\( u \\), and it becomes\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\dot{u} &= \\frac{4(a^2 + x^2)}{4(a^2 + x^2)} \\cdot \\frac{\\dot{x}^2}{\\sqrt{(a^2 + x^2)}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{a^2 x^2}{(a^2 + x^2)^{3/2}}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe very same expression for \\( u \\) would have been found if we had employed the other method.\n\nBy proceeding as in this last example, the rules already delivered for finding the first fluxion of any function of a variable quantity will apply to the finding of the fluxion of any higher order.\n\nThus if we had \\( u = v \\cdot t \\), where \\( v \\) and \\( t \\) denote each a function of another variable quantity \\( x \\), and it were required to find the different orders of fluxions of \\( u \\), considered also as a function of \\( x \\); then, by the rule of \u00a7 37, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\dot{u} &= \\dot{v} \\cdot t + v \\cdot \\dot{t}, \\\\\n\\ddot{u} &= \\text{fluxion of } \\dot{v} \\cdot t + \\text{fluxion of } v \\cdot \\dot{t};\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nbut \\( v \\) and \\( t \\) being variable functions of \\( x \\), we may consider \\( v \\) and \\( t \\) as denoting also variable functions of \\( x \\), the fluxions of which are to be denoted by \\( \\dot{v} \\) and \\( \\dot{t} \\) respectively; now by the rule in \u00a7 37, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{fluxion of } \\dot{v} \\cdot t &= \\dot{v} \\cdot \\dot{t} + \\dot{v} \\cdot \\dot{t}, \\\\\n\\text{and fluxion of } v \\cdot \\dot{t} &= v \\cdot \\dot{t} + v \\cdot \\dot{t},\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\ntherefore, \\( \\ddot{u} = 2 \\dot{v} \\cdot \\dot{t} + \\dot{v} \\cdot \\dot{t} + v \\cdot \\dot{t} \\).\n\nBy considering \\( v, \\dot{v}, \\ddot{v} \\), also \\( t, \\dot{t}, \\ddot{t} \\), as denoting each a distinct function of \\( x \\), we may find the third fluxion of \\( u \\) from the second, in the same manner as the second has been found from the first, and so on for the other orders of fluxions of \\( u \\). If it be now required to express the successive orders of fluxions of \\( u \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and its fluxion, we must find the values of \\( \\dot{v}, \\ddot{v}, \\ddot{v} \\), also of \\( \\dot{t}, \\ddot{t}, \\ddot{t} \\), in terms of \\( x \\) and its fluxion, and these values, also the particular functions of \\( x \\) denoted by \\( v \\) and \\( t \\), being substituted in the expressions found for \\( u, \\dot{u}, \\ddot{u} \\), &c., will give to these expressions the form required.\n\nIf for example we suppose that\n\n\\[ w = a + bx^n, \\quad i = c + dx^n, \\]\n\nthen \\( \\dot{w} = m \\cdot b \\cdot x^{m-1}, \\quad \\dot{i} = n \\cdot d \\cdot x^{n-1} \\),\n\nand, considering \\( x \\) as constant,\n\n\\[ \\ddot{w} = m(m-1)b \\cdot x^{m-2}, \\quad \\ddot{i} = n(n-1)d \\cdot x^{n-2}. \\]\n\nThese values of \\( \\dot{w}, \\dot{i}, \\ddot{w}, \\ddot{i}, \\) &c., being substituted in the expressions of \\( u, \\dot{u}, \\ddot{u}, \\) &c., will give the successive fluxions of \\( u \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( \\dot{x} \\) only.\n\n46. If the fluxion of a variable quantity be considered as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of its rate of increase, if that rate be uniform, then its measure will be a constant quantity; but if it be variable, then its measure will be a variable quantity, which will also have a certain rate of increase or decrease; and the measure of this rate will be its fluxion, or will be the fluxion of the fluxion of the original variable quantity; that is, it will be the second fluxion of the original variable quantity. And if this second fluxion is not a constant quantity, then the measure of its rate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> will be its fluxion, or will be the third fluxion of the original variable quantity, and so on. Thus a quantity will have a successive order of fluxions till some one fluxion become constant, and then it will have no more.\n\n47. We have hitherto supposed the equation expressing the relation between a variable quantity, and a function of that quantity, to be of such a form, that the function was found alone, and of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> on one side of the equation, and some power, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of powers, of the variable quantity on the other; as in these examples,\n\n\\[ u = ax^n, \\quad u = \\frac{a + bx^n}{c + dx^n}. \\]\n\nIn such cases as these, \\( u \\) is said to be an explicit function of \\( x \\). We are now to consider how the ratio of the fluxions is to be found when the relation between the variable quantity and its function is expressed by an equation, the terms of which involve different powers, both of the function, and the variable quantity; as in the following example,\n\n\\[ y^2 - axy + bx^2 - c = 0, \\]\n\nwhere we are to consider \\( y \\) as a function of \\( x \\); but from the particular manner in which its relation to \\( x \\) is expressed, it is said to be an implicit function of that quantity.\n\nNow in this example, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of a quadratic equation, we find\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{ax \\pm \\sqrt{(a^2 - 4b)x^2 + 4c}}{2}, \\]\n\nand as \\( y \\) is here an explicit function of \\( x \\), its fluxion, or the ratio of its fluxion to that of \\( x \\), might be determined by the rules already laid down. But it is to be observed that it is only in the particular case of the proposed equation being of the second degree that we can effect the solution generally in this manner. If it were\nwere of a higher order, this particular mode of solution would be often impracticable, for want of a general method of resolving equations.\n\n48. We may however in all cases resolve the problem, without a previous resolution of the equation, by reasoning as follows.\n\nWhatever be the degree of the equation, by giving particular values to \\( x \\), we can, by the theory of equations, obtain corresponding particular values of \\( y \\); therefore, we may be assured that in every case \\( y \\) is expressible by means of \\( x \\) in some way or other, if not in finite terms, at least in the form of a series, the terms of which shall involve powers of \\( x \\). Hence we may infer, as in the case of explicit functions, that when \\( x \\) changes its value, and becomes \\( x + h \\), \\( y \\) will also change its value, and become\n\n\\[\ny + p h + q h^2 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( p, q, \\ldots \\) denote functions of \\( x \\), that are independent of the arbitrary quantity \\( h \\). Let us denote \\( p b + q h^2 + \\ldots \\) the increment of \\( y \\), by the single letter \\( k \\); then \\( y + k \\) is the new value of \\( y \\), corresponding to \\( x + h \\), the new value of \\( x \\). Let these new values be substituted instead of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in the proposed equation\n\n\\[\ny^2 - ax y + bx^2 = c = 0,\n\\]\n\nand as the result must still be \\( = 0 \\), we have\n\n\\[\n(y + k)^2 - a(x + h)(y + k) + b(x + h)^2 = c = 0;\n\\]\n\nwhich equation, by actually involving its terms, substituting for \\( k \\) its value \\( p h + q h^2 + \\ldots \\), and arranging the result in the form of a series proceeding by the powers of \\( h \\), becomes\n\n\\[\n(2py - a(p x + y) + 2b x)h = 0\n\\]\n\nHere \\( Q, R, \\ldots \\) denote quantities independent of \\( h \\), and involving \\( x, y, p, q, \\ldots \\), that is to say, \\( x \\), and functions of \\( x \\), and therefore \\( Q, R, \\ldots \\) are also functions of \\( x \\). Now as this equation must satisfy whatever \\( h \\) may be, which is a quantity quite arbitrary and independent of the coefficients by which its powers are multiplied; it follows (as has been observed when treating of the method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">indeterminate</a> coefficients, Algebra, \u00a7 261.) that the coefficients of the different powers of \\( h \\) must be each equal to \\( 0 \\).\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\ny^2 - ax y + bx^2 = c = 0\n\\]\n\nFrom the first of these equations we can infer nothing, as it is no other than the proposed equation itself; but from the second we find\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AY\">ay</a> - 2bx}{2y - ax}.\n\\]\n\nNow \\( h \\), and \\( k = ph + q h^2 + \\ldots \\), being the simultaneous increments of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we have \\( \\frac{k}{h} = p + q h + \\ldots \\), therefore, supposing \\( h \\) to be continually diminished, and putting \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\) equal to the limit of \\( \\frac{k}{h} \\), we have \\( \\frac{y}{x} = p \\), therefore\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{ay - 2bx}{2y - ax};\n\\]\n\nthus we have obtained an expression for the ratio of the fluxions of \\( y \\) and \\( x \\), from which we find\n\n\\[\n2yy' - a(xy + y') + 2bxx' = 0,\n\\]\n\nand this is precisely the expression we should have obtained, had we taken the fluxion of each term of\n\n\\[\ny^2 - ax y + bx^2 = c = 0,\n\\]\n\nthe proposed equation, and put the result equal to \\( 0 \\).\n\n49. But to see that this will always be the case, whatever be the degree of the equation, we have only to observe, that, by the very same process employed to deduce from the original equation\n\n\\[\ny^2 - ax y + bx^2 = c = 0,\n\\]\n\nthese two others\n\n\\[\n2py - a(p x + y) + 2b x = 0,\n\\]\n\nif we suppose the equation to be generally expressed thus,\n\n\\[\ny^l + ay^m \\cdots + bx^r + c = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhere the exponents \\( l, m, n, \\ldots \\) denote constant quantities, we shall obtain\n\n\\[\nly^{l-1}p + a(my^{m-1}x^n + nx^{n-1}x) = 0,\n\\]\n\nand hence, by substituting for \\( p \\) its value \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\), and bringing \\( x \\) from the denominator,\n\n\\[\nly^{l-1}y + a(my^{m-1}x^n + nx^{n-1}x) = 0.\n\\]\n\nFrom which it appears that, when the relation between \\( x \\), a variable quantity, and \\( y \\), a function of that quantity, is expressed by an equation, the terms of which are brought all to one side, so as to produce an expression \\( = 0 \\); the relation of the fluxions will be found, by taking the fluxion of each term of the equation (considering \\( y \\) as a function of \\( x \\)), and putting the sum of these fluxions equal to \\( 0 \\).\n\n50. Having from the equation\n\n\\[\ny^2 - ax y + bx^2 = c = 0,\n\\]\n\nfound that\n\n\\[\ny' = \\frac{(ay - 2bx)x'}{2y - ax},\n\\]\n\nif it be required to find the second fluxion of \\( y \\), we have only to take the fluxion of the latter side of this equation,\nequation, considering \\( x \\) as constant, and \\( y \\) as a function of \\( x \\); thus we have\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{(2y - ax)(ay - 2bx)}{(2y - ax)^2}\n\\]\n\nan equation which abbreviates to\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{(4l - a^2)(ay - bx)}{(2y - ax)^2},\n\\]\n\nand from which we may exterminate \\( y \\) by means of the equation\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{(ay - bx)x}{2y - ax}.\n\\]\n\nBy the same mode of proceeding we may determine the third, or any higher fluxion of the function \\( y \\).\n\n51. As far as we have yet gone in explaining the principles of fluxions, we have had continually occasion to employ the rule for finding the fluxion of the particular function \\( x^n \\), where \\( x \\) denotes a variable quantity, and \\( n \\) any constant number; and we may therefore, in respect of other functions consider \\( x^n \\) as a simple function. Besides the function \\( x^n \\), writers on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">Analysis</a> have considered each of the following as also constituting a simple analytic function of a variable quantity; viz.\n\n- \\( a^x \\), where \\( a \\) is constant, and \\( x \\) is variable.\n- Log. \\( x \\), that is the logarithm of \\( x \\), a variable number.\n- Sin. \\( x \\), that is the sine of \\( x \\), a variable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of a circle, radius being unity.\n- Cot. \\( x \\), that is the cotangent of \\( x \\), a variable arch of a circle, radius being as before unity.\n\n52. We have already found the fluxion of \\( x^n \\), and we proceed to find the fluxions of the other simple functions of \\( x \\); and, as in the investigation of these we shall have occasion to employ the binomial theorem, it will be proper to show how that theorem may be deduced from the principles already explained. We are then to find the series that expresses \\((a + x)^n\\), when \\( n \\) is any number whatever. Or, since \\((a + x)^n\\) is equal to \\( a^n (1 + v)^n \\), where \\( v \\) denotes the fraction \\( \\frac{x}{a} \\), we may leave the quantity \\( a^n \\) out of consideration, as has been formerly observed, \u00a7 28, and seek the series that expresses \\((1 + v)^n\\). As we have already pointed out (\u00a7 28) the process of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a> by which we may find the general form of the series, we shall not here repeat it, but assume\n\n\\[\n(1 + v)^n = 1 + A v + B v^2 + C v^3 + D v^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A, B, C, D, \\ldots \\) denote numbers that are independent of \\( v \\).\n\nNow, as the fluxion of a variable function must be the same, whether that function be expressed by one term, or developed into a series of terms; by performing the operation of taking the fluxion on each side of the above equation, the results must be equal, that is, \u00a7 26.\n\nLet\n\n\\[\nn(x + v)^{n-1}v = A v + 2B v^2 + 3C v^3 + 4D v^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nor, leaving out the quantity \\( v \\), common to each term,\n\n\\[\nn(x + v)^{n-1} = A + 2B v + 3C v^2 + 4D v^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nLet both sides of this equation be multiplied by \\( 1 + v \\), and divided by \\( n \\), thus we shall have\n\n\\[\n(1 + v)^n = \\frac{A + 2B v + 3C v^2 + 4D v^3 + \\ldots}{n}\n\\]\n\nThus, by performing on the quantities the analytical process of taking their fluxions, we have obtained a new expression for \\((1 + v)^n\\). Let the quantities that are independent of \\( v \\) in each expression be put equal to each other, and also the coefficients of like powers of \\( v \\); thus we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1 &= \\frac{A}{n}, \\\\\nA &= \\frac{A + 2B}{n}, \\\\\nB &= \\frac{2B + 3C}{n}, \\\\\nC &= \\frac{3C + 4D}{n}, \\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nOr, substituting successively the expression for each coefficient in that which follows it,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nA &= n, \\\\\nB &= \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, \\\\\nC &= \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{2 \\cdot 3}, \\\\\nD &= \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4}, \\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHence it appears that\n\n\\[\n(1 + v)^n = 1 + nv + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}v^2 + \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{2 \\cdot 3}v^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nand therefore, substituting \\( \\frac{x}{a} \\) for \\( v \\), and multiplying by \\( a^n \\),\n\n\\[\n(a + x)^n = a^n + na^{n-1}x + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}a^{n-2}x^2 + \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{2 \\cdot 3}a^{n-3}x^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhere the law of continuation is evident.\n\n53. We now proceed to investigate the fluxion of the function \\( u = a^x \\), \\( a \\) being supposed constant, and \\( x \\) the variable quantity, to which the function is referred.\nLet \\( x \\) be supposed, as formerly, to change its value, and to become \\( x + h \\), and put \\( u' \\) for the new value that the function acquires by this change in the magnitude of \\( x \\); then we have\n\n\\[\nu' = a^x + b = a^x \\times a^b,\n\\]\n\nand, taking the difference between the two succeeding values,\n\n\\[\nu' - u = a^x \\times a^b - a^x = a^x (a^b - 1).\n\\]\n\nWe must now develop the expression \\( a^b - 1 \\) into a series, the terms of which are arranged according to the successive powers of the increment \\( h \\). To effect this, let us put \\( b = a - 1 \\), so that \\( a = 1 + b \\), and \\( a^b = (1 + b)^b \\); but by the binomial theorem, this last expression may be expanded into the following series:\n\n\\[\n1 + hb + \\frac{h(h-1)}{2}b^2 + \\frac{h(h-1)(h-2)}{2 \\cdot 3}b^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\na^b = 1 + hb + \\frac{h(h-1)}{2}b^2 + \\frac{h(h-1)(h-2)}{2 \\cdot 3}b^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nAs the terms of this series are not arranged according to the powers of \\( h \\), but according to the powers of \\( b \\), it is necessary that we transform it into another having the required form; now this may be effected by actually multiplying together all the factors that constitute each term, and arranging the series anew in such a manner, that each of its terms may be a power of \\( h \\), multiplied by a coefficient composed only of the powers of \\( b \\), and given numbers;\n\nAccordingly we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nhb &= b^2 \\\\\n\\frac{h(h-1)}{2}b^2 &= \\frac{b^3}{2} + \\frac{b^2}{2} \\\\\n\\frac{h(h-1)(h-2)}{2 \\cdot 3}b^3 &= \\frac{b^4}{3} + \\frac{b^3}{2} + \\frac{b^2}{6} \\\\\n&\\&c.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, by taking the sum of all the quantities on each side of these equations, we get the series,\n\n\\[\n1 + hb + \\frac{h(h-1)}{2}b^2 + \\frac{h(h-1)(h-2)}{2 \\cdot 3}b^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\notherwise expressed thus,\n\n\\[\n1 + A h + B h^2 + C h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A \\) is equal to the infinite series \\( b - \\frac{b^2}{2} + \\frac{b^3}{3} - \\frac{b^4}{4} + \\&c. \\)\n\nthat is, to\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a-1}{1} = \\frac{(a-1)^2}{2} + \\frac{(a-1)^3}{3} - \\frac{(a-1)^4}{4} + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nand \\( B, C, \\&c. \\) are also quantities composed of the powers of \\( b \\), and consequently are independent of \\( h \\); but as these are all to disappear in the course of the investigation, it is not necessary to express them otherwise, than by a general symbol. Therefore, we have now got\n\n\\[\na^b = 1 + A h + B h^2 + C h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nand consequently,\n\n\\[\nu' - u = a^x (a^b - 1) = a^x (A h + B h^2 + C h^3 + \\&c.)\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\frac{u' - u}{h} = A a^x + B a^x h + C a^x h^2 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nHence, when \\( h \\) is conceived to be continually diminished, we have the limit of \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\), expressed by \\( A a^x \\), and therefore \u00a7 21,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{u'}{x} = A a^x, \\text{ and } u = A a^x.\n\\]\n\n54. In the preceding investigation, we have had occasion to develop the exponential expression \\( a^b \\) into a series of this form,\n\n\\[\n1 + A h + B h^2 + C h^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nthat is, a series the terms of which are the successive powers of the exponent, each multiplied by a coefficient, which is independent of the exponent.\n\nWe have however only determined the coefficients of the first two terms of the series, these being the only ones we had occasion to employ.\n\nThe result of the investigation however may be applied to determine all the coefficients by the very same kind of process as that which we have employed in \u00a7 53, to determine the coefficients of the terms of the series which constitutes the other expansion of \\( a^b \\).\n\nInstead of denoting the exponent by \\( h \\), let us consider it as a variable quantity, and express it by \\( x \\), then, from what has been shewn it appears that\n\n\\[\na^x = 1 + A x + B x^2 + C x^3 + D x^4 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A, B, C, \\&c. \\) express constant quantities. Let the operation of taking the fluxions be now performed on both sides of this equation, (observing that the fluxion of \\( a^x \\) is \\( A a^x \\)) and let all the terms be divided by \\( x \\), which is common to each, thus we obtain\n\n\\[\nA a^x = A + 2B x + 3C x^2 + 4D x^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nand, dividing by \\( A \\),\n\n\\[\na^x = 1 + 2 \\frac{B}{A} x + 3 \\frac{C}{A} x^2 + 4 \\frac{D}{A} x^3 + \\&c.\n\\]\n\nLet the coefficients of the same powers of \\( x \\) in each of the two series expressing \\( a^x \\) be put equal to each other, then,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2B}{A} = A, \\text{ hence, } B = \\frac{A^2}{2},\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3C}{A} = B, \\text{ } \\frac{3C}{A} = \\frac{A^3}{2 \\cdot 3},\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4D}{A} = C, \\text{ } \\frac{4D}{A} = \\frac{A^4}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4},\n\\]\n\n\\&c.\n\nTherefore,\nTherefore, substituting these values of B, C, D, &c., in the original series, we have\n\n\\[ a^x = 1 + A x + \\frac{A^2 x^2}{2} + \\frac{A^3 x^3}{2 \\cdot 3} + \\frac{A^4 x^4}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} + \\ldots \\]\n\nthe same result as has been found in the article ALGEBRA, \u00a7 293, by proceeding in a different manner.\n\n55. If we suppose \\( x = 1 \\), then the preceding equation becomes\n\n\\[ a = 1 + A + \\frac{A^2}{2} + \\frac{A^3}{2 \\cdot 3} + \\frac{A^4}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} + \\ldots \\]\n\nand if we suppose \\( x = \\frac{1}{A} \\), it becomes\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{a} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3} + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} + \\ldots \\]\n\nthus the quantity \\( a^{\\frac{1}{A}} \\) is equal to a constant number which is the value of \\( a \\) when \\( A = 1 \\), and which, by taking the sum of the first ten terms of the series, is found to be \\( 2.7182818 \\), or, by taking the sum of a greater number of terms, more accurately\n\n\\[ 2.718281828459045\\ldots \\]\n\nWe shall, in the remainder of this treatise, denote this number always by \\( e \\), then \\( a^{\\frac{1}{A}} = e \\), and \\( a = e^A \\), and taking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">logarithms</a>, \\( \\log_a = A \\times \\log_e \\), hence\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{\\log_a}{\\log_e}. \\]\n\n56. If we now substitute this value of \\( A \\) in the expression for the fluxion of \\( u = a^x \\), found in \u00a7 53, it becomes\n\n\\[ \\dot{u} = \\frac{\\log_a}{\\log_e} \\cdot a^x \\cdot \\dot{x}. \\]\n\nHence it appears, that the fluxion of the function \\( ax \\) is equal to the fluxion of \\( x \\) multiplied by the function itself, and by the quotient arising from the division of the logarithm of \\( a \\) by the logarithm of \\( e \\), where \\( e \\) denotes \\( 1 + \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{1}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\frac{1}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} + \\ldots \\)\n\nseries whose sum is \\( 2.7182818 \\) nearly.\n\n57. Let us now consider the third simple function of \\( x \\), namely \\( u = \\log_x \\). Let \\( a \\) be the radical number of the particular system, in which \\( u \\) is a logarithm, and \\( x \\) the corresponding number; then from the nature of logarithms (see ALGEBRA, \u00a7 277), we have \\( a^u = x \\). Now, whether we consider \\( u \\) as a function of \\( x \\), or \\( x \\) as a function of \\( u \\), the limiting ratio of their simultaneous increments, and consequently the ratio of their fluxions will be the very same. But by considering \\( x \\) as a function of \\( u \\), we have immediately, from what has been shown in \u00a7 53, and \u00a7 55,\n\n\\[ \\frac{dx}{du} = A \\cdot a^x = Ax, \\]\n\nand therefore, \\( \\dot{u} = \\frac{1}{A} \\cdot \\log_a \\cdot \\dot{x} \\), but as \\( a \\) is the radical number of the system, \\( \\log_a = 1 \\), therefore\n\n\\[ \\dot{u} = \\log_e \\cdot \\dot{x}. \\]\n\nThe number which we have denoted by \\( e \\) occurs very often in analytical investigations; it is the radical number of the system of logarithms first invented by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Napier, and called by some writers Hyperbolic logarithms, but by others, with more propriety, Napierian logarithms.\n\nThe expression \\( \\frac{\\log_e}{\\log_a} \\) is called the modulus of the system of logarithms whose radical number is \\( a \\). In the Napierian system \\( \\frac{\\log_e}{\\log_a} = \\log_e \\cdot \\log_e = 1 \\), that is, the modulus is unity; but in the common system, or that in which \\( a = 10 \\), the modulus \\( \\frac{\\log_e}{\\log_a} = 0.434294482 \\). The rule for finding the fluxion of the logarithm of a variable quantity may now be expressed thus:\n\nMultiply the fluxion of the variable quantity by the modulus of the system, and divide the product by the variable quantity itself, the result is the fluxion required.\n\n58. By the application of the rule for finding the fluxion of the logarithm of a variable quantity we may readily find the fluxions of exponential functions in general. Thus, for example, if \\( u = y^x \\), \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) being both functions of any variable quantity \\( z \\), then \\( \\dot{u} = y \\times \\log_z \\times \\dot{z} \\); and taking the fluxions (considering \\( y \\times \\log_z \\) as the product of two functions \\( y \\) and \\( \\log_z \\), and proceeding by the rules of \u00a7 37 and last),\n\n\\[ \\dot{u} = y \\cdot \\log_z \\cdot \\dot{z} + y \\cdot \\frac{\\dot{z}}{z}, \\]\n\nand hence\n\n\\[ \\dot{u} = n \\left( y \\cdot \\log_z \\cdot \\dot{z} + y \\cdot \\frac{\\dot{z}}{z} \\right), \\]\n\n\\[ = z^y \\left( y \\cdot \\log_z \\cdot \\dot{z} + y \\cdot \\frac{\\dot{z}}{z} \\right). \\]\n\n59. We are next to consider the functions \\( u = \\sin x \\) and \\( u = \\cos x \\).\n\nSuppose \\( x \\) to change its value, and to become \\( x + h \\), and \\( u \\) to become \\( u' \\), then, since\n\n\\[ u = \\sin x, \\text{ and } u' = \\sin (x + h), \\]\n\n\\[ u' - u = \\sin (x + h) - \\sin x; \\]\n\nbut by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a> of sines (see ALGEBRA, \u00a7 353),\n\n\\[ \\sin (x + h) = \\sin x \\cdot \\cos h + \\cos x \\cdot \\sin h, \\text{ therefore, } \\]\n\n\\[ u' - u = \\cos x \\cdot \\cos h + \\cos x \\cdot \\sin h - \\sin x, \\]\n\n\\[ = \\cos x \\cdot \\sin h - \\sin x \\cdot (1 - \\cos h). \\]\n\nIn this case, as when treating formerly of other functions, we might consider the above expression for \\( u' - u \\), as resolvable into a series \\( p h + q h^2 + \\ldots \\) proceeding by the powers of the increment, and thence we might\nmight find the limit of \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\) as before. But we may discover the limit otherwise, by proceeding as follows;\n\nBecause\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 h = 1 - \\cos^2 h = (1 + \\cos h)(1 - \\cos h)\n\\]\n\ntherefore,\n\n\\[\n1 - \\cos h = \\frac{\\sin^2 h}{1 + \\cos h}\n\\]\n\nLet this value of \\( 1 - \\cos h \\) be substituted in the expression for \\( u' - u \\), and it becomes\n\n\\[\nu' - u = \\cos x \\sin h - \\frac{\\sin x \\sin^2 h}{1 + \\cos h}\n\\]\n\nAnd hence, dividing by \\( h \\), and arranging the terms so as to exhibit the ratio \\( \\frac{\\sin h}{h} \\), we get\n\n\\[\n\\frac{u' - u}{h} = \\frac{\\sin h}{h} \\left\\{ \\cos x \\cdot \\frac{\\sin h \\sin x}{1 + \\cos h} \\right\\}\n\\]\n\nConceive now \\( h \\) to be continually diminished, and we shall have the limit of \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\) equal to the limit of \\( \\frac{\\sin h}{h} \\) multiplied by the limit of the following expression\n\n\\[\n\\cos x \\cdot \\frac{\\sin h \\sin x}{1 + \\cos h}\n\\]\n\nNow, the sine of an arch being less than the arch itself, we have \\( \\frac{\\sin h}{h} < 1 \\). Again, the arch being less than its tangent, \\( \\frac{\\sin h}{h} > \\frac{\\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAN\">tan</a> h}{h} \\); but \\( \\tan h = \\frac{\\sin h}{\\cos h} \\)\n\nand therefore \\( \\frac{\\sin h}{\\tan h} = \\cos h \\); consequently \\( \\frac{\\sin h}{h} > \\cos h \\). Hence it appears, that the expression for the ratio \\( \\frac{\\sin h}{h} \\) is less than 1, or radius, but greater than \\( \\cos h \\). But \\( h \\) being conceived to be continually diminished, \\( \\cos h \\) continually approaches to 1, and may come nearer to it than by any assignable difference; therefore, the limit of \\( \\frac{\\sin h}{h} \\) is 1. As to the other expression, \\( \\cos x \\cdot \\frac{\\sin h \\sin x}{1 + \\cos h} \\); when \\( h \\) is supposed to be continually diminished, its second term, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>, \\( \\frac{\\sin h \\sin x}{1 + \\cos h} \\) may become less than any assignable quantity; therefore the limit of the expression is simply \\( \\cos x \\); thus, upon the whole, we have found that the limit of \\( \\frac{u' - u}{h} \\) is \\( \\cos x \\), and therefore\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\cos x, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\dot{x} = \\dot{x} \\cos x\n\\]\n\nThe fluxion of the other function, \\( u = \\cos x \\), is easily deduced from that which we have just found, by proceeding thus:\n\nPut \\( c \\) to denote a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a>, then \\( \\cos x = \\sin(c - x) \\), and therefore\n\n\\[\nu = \\sin(c - x)\n\\]\n\nNow, it has been just shewn that\n\n\\[\n\\text{<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a>. of } \\sin(c - x) = \\cos(c - x) \\times \\text{flux. of } (c - x)\n\\]\n\nbut \\( \\cos(c - x) = \\sin x \\), and the fluxion of \\( c - x \\) is \\( \\dot{x} \\),\n\ntherefore\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = -x \\sin x\n\\]\n\nThus it appears, that the fluxion of the sine of a variable arch is equal to the fluxion of the arch multiplied by its cosine; and that the fluxion of the cosine is equal to the fluxion of the arch (taken with a negative sign) multiplied by the sine.\n\n60. We can now very readily find the fluxion of any other function of an arch of a circle. Thus, suppose \\( u = \\tan x \\); then, because \\( \\tan x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} \\), we have \\( u = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} \\). This expression being considered as a fractional function of \\( x \\), we have, by \u00a7 39, and what has been just now shewn,\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{\\dot{x} \\cos^2 x + \\dot{x} \\sin^2 x}{\\cos^2 x}\n\\]\n\nor, since \\( \\cos^2 x + \\sin^2 x = 1 \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{\\cos x} = \\sec x \\),\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\cos^2 x} = \\dot{x} \\sec^2 x\n\\]\n\nHence also we have \\( \\dot{x} = \\frac{\\dot{u}}{\\sec^2 x} = \\frac{\\dot{u}}{1 + \\dot{u}^2} \\).\n\nIn like manner, if we suppose \\( u = \\sec x \\), then, because \\( \\sec x = \\frac{1}{\\cos x} \\), we have \\( u = \\frac{1}{\\cos x} \\), and\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{\\dot{x} \\sin x}{\\cos^2 x}\n\\]\n\nor, since \\( \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} = \\tan x \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{\\cos x} = \\sec x \\),\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\tan x \\sec x\n\\]\n\nProceeding in this manner, we find that when \\( u = \\cotan x \\), then\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{-\\dot{x}}{\\tan^2 x \\cos^2 x} = \\frac{-\\dot{x}}{\\tan^2 x}\n\\]\n\nAnd when \\( u = \\cosec x \\), then\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{-\\dot{x} \\cos x}{\\sin^2 x} = \\frac{-\\dot{x} \\cotan x \\cosec x}{\\sin^2 x}\n\\]\n\n61. Let us now consider the fluxions of geometrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> magnitudes: And first let it be required to find the expression for the fluxion of BDPC the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> bounded fig. 1. by CP, a curve line, and by CB, PD, the ordinates at its extremities, and BD, the portion of AE, the line of the abscissas, which lies between those ordinates. Let the numerical measures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">AD</a> and PD, the co-ordinates at the point P, be denoted by \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), and the numerical measure of the area BDPC by \\( s \\); then\nthen \\( y \\) and \\( x \\) may both be considered as functions of the abscissa \\( x \\).\n\nLet \\( x \\), or \\( AD \\), be supposed to change its value, and to become \\( AD' \\), and let \\( DP' \\) and \\( BD'PC \\) be the corresponding new values of \\( y \\) and \\( s \\); then \\( DD' \\) and \\( DD'P'P \\) will be the geometrical expressions for the simultaneous increments of the abscissa and area. But, as one of these quantities is a line, and the other a space, they cannot be compared in respect of their ratio. Therefore, let us consider \\( a \\) as denoting a line whose numerical value is unity, and then the numerical values of the increments of the abscissa and area may be considered as analogous to the geometrical quantities \\( DD' \\times a \\), and the area \\( DD'P'P \\) respectively, which quantities being homogeneous may now be compared with each other. We are now to investigate the limit of\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{area } DD'P'P}{a \\times DD'}\n\\]\n\nthe general expression for the ratio of the increments of \\( s \\) and \\( x \\). Draw \\( PM \\) and \\( PN \\) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to \\( AE \\), meeting the ordinates in \\( M \\) and \\( N \\). The curvilinear area \\( DD'P'P \\) is greater than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTANGLE\">rectangle</a> \\( DD'MP \\), that is greater than \\( PD \\times DD' \\); but less than the rectangle \\( DD'PN \\), that is, less than \\( PD' \\times DD' \\), therefore\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{area } DD'P'P}{a \\times DD'} > \\frac{PD \\times DD'}{a \\times DD'} > \\frac{PD'}{a}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{area } DD'P'P}{a \\times DD'} < \\frac{PD' \\times DD'}{a \\times DD'} < \\frac{PD'}{a}\n\\]\n\nBut the increments being supposed to be continually diminished, \\( \\frac{PD}{a} \\) is the limit of \\( \\frac{PD'}{a} \\), therefore \\( \\frac{PD}{a} \\) is also the limit of \\( \\frac{\\text{area } DD'P'P}{a \\times DD'} \\), and hence (\u00a7 21.)\n\n\\[\n\\frac{s}{x} = \\frac{PD}{a} = \\frac{y}{1} = y, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\dot{s} = \\dot{y} \\dot{x}.\n\\]\n\nThat is, the fluxion of a curvilinear area is equal to the product of the ordinate, and the fluxion of the abscissa.\n\n62. Before we proceed to investigate the expression for the fluxion of an arch of a curve, it is necessary that we should inquire what is the limiting ratio of an arch of a curve to its chord.\n\nLet \\( APB \\) be any curve line, all the parts of which are concave towards its chord \\( AP \\). Let \\( AQ, QP \\) be tangents at the extremities of the arch, and let \\( aq \\rho \\) be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> similar to \\( APQ \\), but having its base \\( ap \\) of a given magnitude, then\n\n\\[\nAQ + QP : AP :: aq + q \\rho : ap.\n\\]\n\nSuppose now the point \\( P \\) to approach to \\( A \\), then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> at \\( A \\) and \\( P \\), and consequently the angles at \\( a \\) and \\( \\rho \\), which are equal to them, will decrease, and may become less than any assignable angles; therefore, the limit of the ratio of \\( aq + q \\rho \\) to \\( ap \\) is evidently a ratio of equality; hence also the limit of the ratio of \\( AQ + QP \\) to \\( AP \\) is the ratio of equality; and since the arch \\( AP \\) is less than \\( AQ + QP \\), but greater than its chord \\( AP \\), the limit of the arch \\( AP \\) to its chord \\( AP \\) must also be the ratio of equality.\n\n63. We proceed now to find the fluxion of an arch of a curve. Let \\( APP' \\) be a curve line of any kind, and \\( <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a>, BP \\) any two co-ordinates at a point \\( P \\) in the curve. Put \\( x \\) for \\( AB \\), the abscissa, \\( y \\) for \\( BP \\), the ordinate, and \\( z \\) for the curve line \\( AP \\), then \\( z \\) and \\( y \\) may be considered as each a function of \\( x \\). Draw \\( P'B' \\) another ordinate, and draw \\( PM \\) parallel to \\( AB \\), meeting \\( P'B' \\) in \\( M \\); and draw the chord \\( PP' \\); then \\( PM, MP' \\) and the arch \\( PP' \\) are the simultaneous increments of \\( x, y, \\) and \\( z \\) respectively. Now we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{arch } PP'}{PM} = \\frac{\\text{arch } PP'}{\\text{chord } PP'} \\times \\frac{\\text{chord } PP'}{PM}.\n\\]\n\nBut chord \\( PP' = \\sqrt{(PM^2 + MP'^2)} = PM \\sqrt{(1 + \\frac{MP'^2}{PM^2})} \\);\n\ntherefore,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{arch } PP'}{PM} = \\frac{\\text{arch } PP'}{\\text{chord } PP'} \\times \\sqrt{(1 + \\frac{MP'^2}{PM^2})}.\n\\]\n\nSuppose now the increments to be continually diminished, then, as \\( \\frac{z}{x} = \\text{limit of } \\frac{\\text{arch } PP'}{PM} \\), and \\( \\frac{y^2}{x^2} = \\text{limit of } \\frac{\\text{chord } PP'}{\\text{chord } PP'} \\) (inf. \u00a7) we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{z}{x} = \\sqrt{(1 + \\frac{y^2}{x^2})}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\dot{z} = \\sqrt{(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2)}.\n\\]\n\nHence it appears that the square of the fluxion of a curve line of any kind is equal to the sum of the squares of the fluxions of the co-ordinates.\n\n64. The expression for the fluxion of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> may be found by the same mode of reasoning as that which we have employed, \u00a7 61., to find the fluxion of a curvilinear area. Let \\( APQP \\) be a portion of a solid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by the revolution of \\( APB \\), a curve line, about \\( AC \\), a line taken in the plane of the curve, as an axis. Let \\( PD \\rho, P'D' \\rho' \\) be the lines in which \\( BA \\rho \\), a plane passing along the axis \\( AC \\), meets \\( PQ \\rho, P'Q' \\rho' \\), the planes of two circles formed by sections of the solid perpendicular to its axis. Draw \\( PM \\) and \\( PN \\) parallel to \\( AD \\). Put \\( AD = x, DP = y \\), let \\( s \\) denote the solid \\( APQP \\), having \\( y \\) for the radius of its circular base, and \\( x \\) for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a>; put \\( \\pi \\) for the number \\( 3^{14159} \\), viz. the circumference of a circle having its diameter \\( = 1 \\), and let \\( a \\) denote an area, having its numerical measure expressed by unity; then, \\( DD', \\) or \\( a \\times DD' \\) being considered as the increment of \\( x \\), the portion of the solid comprehended between the parallel planes \\( PQ \\rho, P'Q' \\rho' \\) will be the corresponding increment of \\( s \\), which we are to consider as a function of \\( x \\); hence (\\$ 21.) \\( \\frac{s}{x} \\) is equal to the limiting ratio of the portion of the solid, comprehended between the planes \\( PQ \\rho, P'Q' \\rho' \\) to the solid \\( a \\times DD' \\). But the former of these solids being evidently greater than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> \\( Pm \\), having the circle \\( PQ \\rho \\) for its base, and \\( DD' \\) for its altitude, that is greater than \\( \\pi PD^2 \\times DD' \\), and less than a cylinder \\( N \\rho' \\), having the circle \\( P'Q' \\rho' \\) for its base, and \\( DD' \\) for its altitude, that is less than \\( \\pi P'D'^2 \\times DD' \\);\nDirect Method. It follows, that as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as DD' has an assignable magnitude,\n\n\\[ \\frac{s}{x} > \\pi PD' \\times DD' \\times \\frac{1}{a \\times DD'} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{s}{x} > \\frac{\\pi PD'^2}{a} \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ \\frac{s}{x} < \\pi P'D'^2 \\times DD' \\times \\frac{1}{a \\times DD'} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{s}{x} < \\frac{\\pi P'D'^2}{a} \\]\n\nbut the increment DD' being continually diminished, \\( \\frac{\\pi P'D'^2}{a} \\), the greater limit of \\( \\frac{s}{x} \\) approaches continually to its lesser limit \\( \\frac{\\pi y^2}{a} = \\frac{\\pi y^2}{a} \\) (because \\( a = 1 \\)) \\( \\pi y^2 \\),\n\nso as to come nearer to it than by any assignable difference, therefore \\( \\frac{s}{x} = \\pi y^2 \\), and \\( s = \\pi y^2 x \\). Now, if we observe that \\( \\pi y^2 \\) is the area of the circle PQ, it will appear, that the fluxion of a solid generated by the revolution of a curve about its axis is equal to the fluxion of the axis multiplied by the general expression for the area of a circle formed by supposing the solid to be cut by a plane perpendicular to its axis.\n\n65. To find the fluxion of the surface of the solid, let us denote that surface by \\( s \\), and let \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) denote as before; then the surface contained between the circles PQ and P'Q' will be the increment of \\( s \\), corresponding to DD' the increment of \\( x \\). Draw the chord PP'; then, the curve line PP' being supposed to revolve about the axis AC, and thus to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> the increment of the surface of the solid, the chord PP' will generate at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the convex surface of a frustum of a cone; now the limiting ratio of the curve line PP' to its chord PP' being the ratio of equality, the limiting ratio of the surfaces generated by the revolution of those lines will also be the ratio of equality; therefore \\( \\frac{s}{x} \\), which is equal to the limit of\n\n\\[ \\text{surf. gener. by arch PP'} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{x \\times DD'} \\]\n\nwill also be equal to the limit of\n\n\\[ \\text{surf. gener. by chord PP'} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{DD'}{DD'} \\]\n\nbut the convex surface of a frustum of a cone is equal to the product of its slant side into half the sum of the circumferences of its two bases (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">Geometry</a>), and in the present case these circumferences are equal to \\( 2 PD \\times \\pi \\), and \\( 2 P'D' \\times \\pi \\), therefore \\( \\frac{s}{x} \\) is equal to the limit of\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\pi (PD + P'D') PP'}{DD'} = \\pi (PD + P'D') \\frac{PP'}{DD'} \\]\n\nbut the point D' being supposed to approach to D, the limit of \\( PD + P'D' \\), will manifestly be \\( 2 PD = 2 y \\); and since\n\n\\[ \\frac{PP'}{DD'} = \\sqrt{(DD'^2 + P'M^2)} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{DD'}{DD'} = \\sqrt{(1 + \\frac{P'M^2}{DD'^2})} \\]\n\nthe limit of this expression (if we consider that P'M and DD' are the simultaneous increments of \\( y \\) and \\( x \\)) is evidently equal to \\( \\sqrt{(1 + \\frac{y^2}{x^2})} \\), therefore\n\n\\[ \\frac{s}{x} = 2 \\pi y \\sqrt{(1 + \\frac{y^2}{x^2})} \\]\n\nand consequently\n\n\\[ s = 2 \\pi y \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)} \\]\n\nIf we now observe that \\( 2 \\pi y \\) is the circumference of the circle PQ, and \\( \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)} \\) is the fluxion of the curve line AP, \u00a7 63, it will appear, that the fluxion of the surface of a solid generated by the revolution of a curve about its axis is equal to the fluxion of the curve line multiplied by the general expression for the circumference of a circle formed by supposing the curve to be cut by a plane perpendicular to its axis.\n\nSect. III. The Application of the Direct Method of Fluxions.\n\nHaving explained the principles of the direct method of fluxions at as great a length as we think suitable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of which this treatise forms a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>, we proceed to show how the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a> may be applied to the resolution of some general problems in Analysis and Geometry.\n\nInvestigation of a general formula for expanding a Function into a Series.\n\n66. In treating of the principles of the method of fluxions, we have from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of particular functions, inferred by induction, that \\( u \\) being any function of a variable quantity \\( x \\), which was either actually expressed, or capable of being expressed by a combination of the powers of \\( x \\), then, \\( x \\) being supposed to change its value, and to become \\( x + h \\), the new value which the function \\( u \\) will acquire when \\( x + h \\) is substituted in it instead of \\( x \\) will always be capable of being expanded into a series of this form,\n\n\\[ u + p h + q h^2 + r h^3 + &c. \\]\n\nwhere \\( p, q, &c. \\) denote functions of \\( x \\) that are quite independent of \\( h \\).\n\nWe have shewn that, from the particular form of this development, it happens that the ratio of \\( p h + q h^2 + r h^3 + &c. \\) the increment of the function, to \\( h \\) the increment of the variable quantity \\( x \\) itself, admits of a limit, which is always expressed by \\( p \\), the coefficient of its second term; and as we have defined this limit to be the expression for the ratio of the fluxions of \\( u \\) and \\( x \\), so that \\( p = \\frac{u}{x} \\), the new value of the function may also be expressed thus\n\n\\[ u + \\frac{u}{x} h + q h^2 + r h^3 + &c. \\]\nAnd this expression may be considered as indicating not only the general form of the series, but also the particular relation subsisting between \\( u \\), the original function, and \\( p \\), the coefficient of the second term of the series, the latter being in every case that function of \\( x \\) which results from the operation of taking the fluxion of the former, and dividing by \\( x \\).\n\nWe are now to investigate the relation that fulfills between each of the remaining coefficients and the original function.\n\n67. First let us suppose the function \\( u \\) to have the particular form \\( x^n \\), \\( n \\) being a constant number. When \\( x \\) changing its value to \\( x + h \\), \\( u \\) changes to \\( u' = (x + h)^n \\), therefore, by the binomial theorem (\\$52),\n\n\\[\nu' = x^n + nx^{n-1}h + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}x^{n-2}h^2 + \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3!}x^{n-3}h^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nBut since \\( u = x^n \\), by taking the successive fluxions of \\( u \\), and considering \\( x \\) as constant, we have,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{u}{x} &= nx^{n-1}, \\\\\n\\frac{u}{x^2} &= n(n-1)x^{n-2}, \\\\\n\\frac{u}{x^3} &= n(n-1)(n-2)x^{n-3}, \\\\\n\\frac{u}{x^4} &= n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)x^{n-4}, \\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nLet \\( u, \\frac{u}{x}, \\frac{u}{x^2}, \\ldots \\) be now substituted for \\( x^n, nx^{n-1}, n(n-1)x^{n-2}, \\ldots \\) respectively, in the series for \\( u' \\), and we have\n\n\\[\nu' = u + \\frac{u}{x}h + \\frac{u}{x^2}h^2 + \\frac{u}{x^3}h^3 + \\frac{u}{x^4}h^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\n68. This manner of expressing the development of \\( u' \\), or \\( (x + h)^n \\), indicates directly the relation that each of the coefficients of the successive powers of \\( h \\) has to the original function.\n\nThe first term of the series is the original function \\( u \\), or \\( x^n \\) itself, or it is what the function \\( (x + h)^n \\) becomes upon the supposition that \\( h = 0 \\). The second term is \\( h \\), or \\( \\frac{h}{1} \\), multiplied by the coefficient \\( \\frac{u}{x} \\), which coefficient is a function of \\( x \\) derived from the original function by the operation of taking its fluxion, and dividing the result by \\( x \\). The third term is \\( \\frac{h^2}{1 \\cdot 2} \\) multiplied by the coefficient \\( \\frac{u}{x^2} \\), that is, by a function of \\( x \\) derived from the preceding coefficient \\( \\frac{u}{x} \\) by the same operation as that coefficient was derived from the original function, namely by taking the fluxion of \\( \\frac{u}{x} \\), considering \\( x \\) as constant, and dividing by \\( x \\). The fourth term is \\( \\frac{h^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} \\) multiplied by \\( \\frac{u}{x^3} \\), that is, by a function of \\( x \\) deduced from the third coefficient by the very same operation as that by which the third was derived from the second, or the second from the first. And so on with respect to all the other terms of the series, the \\( n \\)th term being the product of \\( \\frac{h^{n-1}}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots (n-1)} \\), and the \\( (n-1) \\)th fluxion of the function \\( u \\) divided by \\( x^{n-1} \\).\n\n69. Let us now suppose that \\( u \\) denotes any other function of \\( x \\), then, whatever be its nature, it may always be conceived as capable of being expressed by a series, the terms of which are powers of \\( x \\), in this manner;\n\n\\[\nA x^a + B x^b + C x^c + D x^d + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A, B, C, \\ldots \\) denote constant numbers. Thus we have\n\n\\[\nu = A x^a + B x^b + C x^c + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nThen, \\( x \\) being supposed to become \\( x + h \\), and (in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the change in the value of \\( x \\)) \\( u \\) to become \\( u' \\), we have\n\n\\[\nu' = A (x + h)^a + B (x + h)^b + C (x + h)^c + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nLet us now denote \\( A x^a \\) by \\( P \\), \\( B x^b \\) by \\( Q \\), \\( C x^c \\) by \\( R \\), &c., then by last \u00a7\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nA (x + h)^a &= P + \\frac{P}{x}h + \\frac{P}{x^2}h^2 + \\frac{P}{x^3}h^3 + \\ldots \\\\\nB (x + h)^b &= Q + \\frac{Q}{x}h + \\frac{Q}{x^2}h^2 + \\frac{Q}{x^3}h^3 + \\ldots \\\\\nC (x + h)^c &= R + \\frac{R}{x}h + \\frac{R}{x^2}h^2 + \\frac{R}{x^3}h^3 + \\ldots \\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, substituting these developments in the series expressing \\( u' \\),\n\n\\[\nu' = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{l}\nP + Q + R + \\ldots \\\\\n+ \\left( \\frac{P}{x} + \\frac{Q}{x} + \\frac{R}{x} + \\ldots \\right) h \\\\\n+ \\left( \\frac{P}{x^2} + \\frac{Q}{x^2} + \\frac{R}{x^2} + \\ldots \\right) \\frac{h^2}{2} \\\\\n+ \\left( \\frac{P}{x^3} + \\frac{Q}{x^3} + \\frac{R}{x^3} + \\ldots \\right) \\frac{h^3}{2 \\cdot 3} \\\\\n+ \\ldots\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\]\nBut\n\n\\[ u = P + Q + R + \\&c. \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} = \\frac{\\dot{P}}{x} + \\frac{\\dot{Q}}{x} + \\frac{\\dot{R}}{x} + \\&c. \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2} = \\frac{\\ddot{P}}{x^2} + \\frac{\\ddot{Q}}{x^2} + \\frac{\\ddot{R}}{x^2} + \\&c. \\]\n\n\\&c.\n\nTherefore, substituting \\( u, \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x}, \\&c. \\) for the series to which they are respectively equal,\n\n\\[ u' = u + \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} \\cdot \\frac{h}{1} + \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2} \\cdot \\frac{h^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^3} \\cdot \\frac{h^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\&c. \\]\n\nHence it appears that \\( u \\) being any function of \\( x \\) whatever, if \\( x + h \\) be substituted in that function instead of \\( x \\), the series expressing the development of this new value of the function will have the general properties which have been thrown, in last \\( \\&c. \\) belong to it in the case of the function having the particular value \\( x^n \\).\n\nThe very general theorem which we have just now investigated is one of the most elegant and important in analysis. It was first published by Dr Brooke Taylor in a work entitled Methodus Incrementorum, which made its appearance about the year 1716. The theorem itself is generally known by the name of Taylor's theorem. It is more general than the celebrated Binomial theorem, inasmuch as this last, and innumerable others, are comprehended in it as particular cases.\n\n70. We shall now give some examples to shew the manner of applying Taylor's theorem, as well as its great utility as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of analysis.\n\nExample 1. Suppose \\( u = a^x \\), \\( a \\) being constant and \\( x \\) variable. Then \\( x \\) becoming \\( x + h \\), \\( u \\) becomes \\( u' = a^{x+h} \\).\n\nNow from the equation \\( u = a^x \\) we derive (\\$ 56.)\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} = A \\cdot a^x \\] (here \\( A \\) denotes \\( \\log_a e \\)).\n\nAgain, considering \\( x \\) as constant, and repeating the operation of taking the fluxion on \\( \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} = A \\cdot a^x \\), we get \\( \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2} = A^2 \\cdot a^x \\), and hence again \\( \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2} = A^3 \\cdot a^x \\), \\&c. Therefore, substituting for \\( u', \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x}, \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2}, \\&c. \\) their values in the general theorem\n\n\\[ u' = u + \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} \\cdot \\frac{h}{1} + \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2} \\cdot \\frac{h^2}{2} + \\&c. \\] it becomes\n\n\\[ a^{x+h} = a^x \\left( 1 + A \\cdot h + \\frac{A^2}{2} \\cdot h^2 + \\frac{A^3}{2 \\cdot 3} \\cdot h^3 + \\&c. \\right) \\]\n\nSuppose now, that \\( x = 0 \\), then, as in this case \\( a^x = 1 \\), we have\n\n\\[ d^h = 1 + A \\cdot h + \\frac{A^2}{2} \\cdot h^2 + \\frac{A^3}{2 \\cdot 3} \\cdot h^3 + \\&c. \\]\n\nor, exchanging \\( h \\) for \\( x \\)\n\n\\[ a^x = 1 + A \\cdot x + \\frac{A^2}{2} \\cdot x^2 + \\frac{A^3}{2 \\cdot 3} \\cdot x^3 + \\&c. \\]\n\nthe same result as we formerly obtained in \u00a7 54.\n\nEx. 2. Suppose \\( u = \\log_x x \\). Then, \\( x \\) becoming \\( x + h \\), \\( u \\) becomes \\( u' = \\log_x (x + h) \\). Now from the equation \\( u = \\log_x x \\), we find (by \u00a7 57.) \\( \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} = \\frac{M}{x} \\).\n\nHere \\( M \\) denotes the modulus of the system. Again, supposing \\( x \\) constant, we find by \u00a7 26, \\( \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2} = -\\frac{M}{x^2} \\),\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^3} = -\\frac{2M}{x^3}, \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^4} = -\\frac{3M}{x^4} \\&c. \\]\n\nTherefore, substituting as before the values of \\( u', \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x}, \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2}, \\&c. \\) in the general formula \\( u' = u + \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} \\cdot \\frac{h}{1} + \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2} \\cdot \\frac{h^2}{2} + \\&c. \\) it becomes\n\n\\[ \\log_x (x + h) = \\log_x x + \\frac{M}{x} \\cdot \\frac{h}{1} - \\frac{M}{2x^2} \\cdot \\frac{h^2}{2} + \\frac{M}{3x^3} \\cdot \\frac{h^3}{3} + \\&c. \\]\n\nIf we suppose \\( x = 1 \\), and change \\( h \\) into \\( y \\), we have, because \\( \\log_1 x = \\log_1 x = 0 \\),\n\n\\[ \\log_1 (1 + y) = M \\left( y - \\frac{y^2}{2} + \\frac{y^3}{3} - \\&c. \\right) \\]\n\nFor the particular method of applying these two series to the calculation of logarithms, see Algebra \u00a7 285 to \u00a7 291. See also Logarithms.\n\nEx. 3. Suppose now \\( u = \\sin x \\). Then \\( u' = \\sin (x + h) \\). From \\( u = \\sin x \\), by the application of the rule in \u00a7 59, we deduce \\( \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x} = \\cos x, \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2} = -\\sin x, \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^3} = -\\cos x, \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^4} = \\sin x, \\&c. \\)\n\nTherefore, substituting for \\( u', \\frac{\\dot{u}}{x}, \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{x^2}, \\&c. \\) their values in the general formula as before, we have\n\n\\[ \\sin (x + h) = \\sin x + \\cos x \\cdot \\frac{h}{1} - \\sin x \\cdot \\frac{h^2}{1 \\cdot 2} - \\cos x \\cdot \\frac{h^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\&c. \\]\n\nor \\( \\sin (x + h) \\) is equal to\n\n\\[ \\sin x \\left( 1 - \\frac{h^2}{2} + \\frac{h^4}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} - \\&c. \\right) + \\cos x \\left( \\frac{h^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\frac{h^5}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5} - \\&c. \\right) \\]\n\nIf we suppose \\( x = 0 \\), then, as in that case \\( \\sin x = 0 \\), the preceding formula becomes\nNow, \\( u' \\) being the value that \\( u \\) assumes when \\( x + h \\) is substituted in it instead of \\( x \\), if we suppose \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( u' \\) becomes the very same function of \\( h \\) that \\( u \\) is of \\( x \\).\n\nLet us denote the values which each of the functions \\( u, \\frac{u}{x}, \\frac{u}{x^2}, \\ldots \\) acquire, when \\( x = 0 \\), by \\( U, U', U'' \\ldots \\) respectively.\n\nThen \\( (x) u' \\) (considered as the same function of \\( h \\) that \\( u \\) is of \\( x \\)) is equal to\n\n\\[\nU + U' \\frac{h}{1} + U'' \\frac{h^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + U''' \\frac{h^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nLet \\( x \\) be now supposed to be substituted both in \\( u' \\) and the series which is its development instead of \\( h \\); then \\( u' \\) becomes \\( u \\), and we have\n\n\\[\nu = U + U' \\frac{x}{1} + U'' \\frac{x^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + U''' \\frac{x^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nand in this formula it is to be considered, as already stated, that \\( U, U', U'' \\ldots \\) denote the particular values which the functions \\( u, \\frac{u}{x}, \\frac{u}{x^2}, \\ldots \\) acquire respectively, by supposing that in each of them \\( x \\) is taken \\( = 0 \\).\n\n72.

The theory of tangents to curve lines furnishes a good illustration of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of the principle which we have considered as the foundation of the method of fluxions, namely, that whatever be the form of a function, the ratio of its increment to the increment of the variable quantity from which the function is formed, is in every case susceptible of a limit.\n\nLet \\( AB \\), the abscissa of a curve, be the geometrical expression of a variable quantity \\( x \\), and let \\( BP \\) the corresponding ordinate, be the expression for \\( y \\), any function of \\( x \\); then the curve line itself is the locus of the equation expressing the relation between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Let \\( PT \\), a tangent to the curve at \\( P \\), meet \\( AB \\) the abscissa in \\( T \\); through \\( P \\) draw any straight line meeting the abscissa in \\( D \\), and the curve in \\( P \\); draw the ordinate \\( PB \\), and from \\( P \\) draw \\( PN \\) parallel to the abscissa, meeting the ordinate \\( BD \\) in \\( N \\).\n\nThe triangles \\( DBP, PN \\) are similar; therefore\n\n\\[\nPN : NP :: PB : BD.\n\\]\n\nNow \\( PN \\), and \\( NP \\), or \\( BB \\), are the increments of \\( PB \\) and \\( BA \\), or of \\( y \\) and \\( x \\) respectively, therefore the ratio of the simultaneous increments of \\( PB \\) and \\( BA \\), or \\( y \\) and \\( x \\), whatever be their magnitudes, is equal to the ratio of \\( PB \\) to \\( BD \\). Conceive now the point \\( P \\) to approach continually to \\( P \\), then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> contained by the straight line \\( PD \\), and the tangent \\( PT \\), will decrease, and the point \\( D \\) will approach to \\( T \\); at the same time \\( NP \\), and \\( NP \\), the increments of \\( y \\) and \\( x \\) will be continually diminished; still, however, they will have to each other the ratio of \\( PB \\) to \\( BD \\), but this ratio approaches continually to the ratio of \\( PB \\) to \\( BT \\), and becomes at last more nearly equal to it than any assignable ratio; therefore the ratio of \\( PB \\) to \\( BT \\) is the limit of the ratio of \\( PB \\) to \\( BD \\), and consequently is also the limit of the ratio of \\( p \\) to \\( n \\), the increment of \\( y \\) to \\( n \\), the increment of \\( x \\). And as this conclusion does not depend upon the particular nature of the curve, or upon any particular relation supposed between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we may conclude, that whatever be the form of the function, the ratio of the simultaneous increments of the function, and the variable quantity from which it is formed, has a limit to which it approaches when the increments are conceived to be continually diminished.\n\nIt is now easy to see how the method of fluxions may be applied to the determination of tangents to curves, for since the ratio of the ordinate \\( PB \\) to the subtangent \\( BT \\) is always the limiting ratio of the increments of the ordinate and abscissa, it is equal to the ratio of their fluxions, that is\n\n\\[\n\\dot{y} : \\dot{x} :: y : \\text{subtan. } BT.\n\\]\n\nHence in any curve whatever, referred to an axis, the subtangent, (that is, the segment of the abscissa between the ordinate and tangent) is equal to \\( \\frac{\\dot{y}}{\\dot{x}} \\) where \\( x \\) denotes the abscissa, and \\( y \\) the ordinate at the point of contact; and the subtangent being found, the position of the tangent is thereby determined.\n\nLet us apply the above general formula to some examples.\n\nExample 1. Let the proposed curve be a circle. It is required to determine the position of \\( PT \\), a tangent Fig. 7- at any point \\( P \\) in its circumference.\n\nPut \\( 2a \\) for \\( AE \\) the diameter, also \\( x \\) for \\( AB \\) the abscissa, and \\( y \\) for \\( BP \\) the ordinate at the point of contact.\n\nFrom the nature of the curve, we have\n\n\\[\nAB \\times BE = BP^2, \\text{ that is }\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx(2a - x) = y^2.\n\\]\n\nHence taking the relations of the fluxions of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we have\n\n\\[\n2ax - 2x\\dot{x} = 2y\\dot{y},\n\\]\n\ntherefore \\( \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\dot{y}} = \\frac{y}{a-x}, \\)\n\nand \\( BT = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\dot{y}} = \\frac{y^2}{a-x}; \\)\n\nfrom which it appears that \\( BT \\) the subtangent is a third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to \\( a-x \\) and \\( y \\), that is, to \\( CB \\) the distance of the ordinate from the centre, and \\( BP \\) the ordinate, agreeing with what is known from the elements of geometry.\n\nEx. 2.

If \\( PT \\) be a tangent to the curve \\( AP \\) at the point \\( P \\), and \\( PC \\) be drawn perpendicular to the tangent, meeting \\( AC \\) the axis of the curve in \\( C \\), then the line \\( PC \\) is called a normal to the curve at the point \\( P \\); and \\( BC \\), the distance between the ordinate and the extremity of the normal, is called the sub-normal.\n\nThe triangles \\( TBP \\), \\( BPC \\) being similar, we have\n\n\\[\nTB : BP :: BP : BC; \\quad \\text{or, since } TB : BP :: \\dot{x} : \\dot{y}, (\\$ 73)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\dot{x} : \\dot{y} :: y : BC, \\quad \\text{hence in any curve, BC the sub-normal}\n\\]\n\nis equal to \\( \\frac{y}{\\dot{x}} \\), and from this expression, we may find the sub-normal in the same way as we have found the sub-tangent in the examples of last \u00a7.\n\n75. As by plane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">trigonometry</a>\n\n\\[\nTB : BP :: \\text{rad. : tangent of } T,\n\\]\n\nand from \u00a7 73, \\( TB : BP :: \\dot{x} : \\dot{y} \\),\n\n\\[\n\\dot{x} : \\dot{y} :: 1 : \\tan. T,\n\\]\n\nhence it appears that \\( \\frac{\\dot{y}}{\\dot{x}} \\) expresses the numeral tangent of the angle \\( T \\), that is the angle contained by a tangent to the curve, and the axis of the curve. In like manner we have\n\n\\[\n\\dot{y} : \\dot{x} :: BP : BD :: CB : BP :: 1 : \\tan. C,\n\\]\n\ntherefore \\( \\frac{\\dot{y}}{\\dot{x}} \\) expresses the tangent of the angle \\( C \\), that is the angle contained by a normal to the curve and its axis.\n\nApplication\nApplication of Fluxions to Problems relating to Maxima and Minima.\n\n76. If a variable quantity be supposed to change its magnitude, then any function of that quantity will also change its magnitude. When the variable quantity is supposed to increase continually so as to acquire successively all degrees of magnitude, there are some functions of such a form, that they either increase continually, or decrease continually; but there are others again which either increase to a certain limit, after which they decrease; or else they decrease to a certain limit, after which they increase.\n\nIf, in consequence of the continual increase of a variable quantity, a function of that quantity first increases to a certain limit, and afterwards decreases, when it arrives at that limit it is then said to be a maximum. Or if it decrease to a certain limit, and afterwards increase, when it arrives at that limit, it is then said to be a minimum.\n\n77. Let us consider the function \\( y = b - (x-a)^2 \\). If we suppose \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( y = b - a^2 \\). Suppose now \\( x \\) to be at first very small, and to increase; then as \\( (x-a)^2 \\) will decrease, \\( y \\) will also increase, till \\( x \\) become \\( a \\), and then \\( y \\) will become \\( b \\), when it is a maximum; for \\( x \\) being supposed to become greater than \\( a \\), \\( y \\) will be less than \\( b \\). By supposing \\( x \\) to increase till \\( (x-a)^2 \\) become equal to \\( b \\), then \\( y \\) will decrease to \\( 0 \\); and \\( x \\) being still supposed to increase, \\( y \\) will become negative.\n\nLet us next suppose \\( y = b + (x-a)^2 \\). In this case when \\( x = 0 \\), \\( y = b + a^2 \\); as \\( x \\) increases, \\( (x-a)^2 \\) decreases, and consequently \\( y \\) decreases, till \\( x = a \\), and then \\( y = b \\), a minimum; for \\( x \\) becoming greater than \\( a \\), \\( y \\) becomes greater than \\( b \\).\n\n78. Every function that either increases or decreases continually has neither maximum nor minimum; for whatever value such a function may acquire, in the one case it may always have a greater, and in the other a less value.\n\nThe characteristic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of a maximum value of a function, by which it is made the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of analytical inquiry, consists in its being greater than the values immediately preceding, and also greater than the values immediately following it; and that of a minimum consists in its being less than the values immediately preceding, and also less than the values immediately following it.\n\nIn some cases a function may increase to a certain limit and then decrease, and afterwards increase again indefinitely; or the contrary. Hence it may happen that such a function may have values greater than its maximum or less than its minimum as they have been here defined. And indeed it is easy to conceive that a function may increase and decrease alternately several times; in such a case it must be considered as having several maxima and minima.\n\n79. Since \\( y \\) any function of a variable quantity \\( x \\) may be considered as the ordinate of a curve, of which \\( x \\) is the abscissa, it is evident that to determine the greatest or least value of such a function, we have only to seek the greatest or least ordinate of the curve which is the locus of the equation expressing the relation between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Let us suppose this curve to be \\( DPE \\), and that \\( AB \\) is the value of \\( x \\), corresponding to \\( BP \\), the maximum or minimum value of the ordinate \\( y \\); it is evident, that in the case of a maximum, the curve must be concave towards \\( AC \\), at least to a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, on each side of the point \\( P \\), as in fig. 12, but that in the case of a minimum it must be convex towards \\( AC \\), as in fig. 13; and also, that in either case, if a straight line be drawn through \\( P \\) parallel to \\( AC \\), the curve must be wholly on one side of that line, to a certain extent on each side of the point \\( P \\), and therefore, that the line \\( PQ \\) must be a tangent to the curve at the point \\( P \\).\n\nNow when \\( PQ \\) a tangent to a curve at \\( P \\) (fig. 8) meets the axis in \\( T \\), it has been shewn, \u00a7 75, that \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\) is the expression for the tangent of the angle \\( T \\), radius being unity; but this angle vanishes, when \\( PQ \\), instead of meeting \\( AC \\), is parallel to it, as in fig. 12, and fig. 13; therefore, as in this case the tangent of the angle is \\( = 0 \\), we have \\( \\frac{y}{x} = 0 \\).\n\nHence it appears, that to determine the maximum or minimum of \\( y \\), a function of \\( x \\), we must find the fluxion of the function, and divide it by \\( x \\), and put the result equal to \\( 0 \\).\n\n80. We proceed to illustrate this rule by some examples.\n\nEx. 1. To divide a given number \\( a \\) into two such parts, that their product may be the greatest possible.\n\nLet \\( x \\) denote the one part, then \\( a-x \\) will be the other part, and \\( x(a-x) \\) the product of the two parts. Therefore, by the question\n\n\\[\ny = x(a-x) = ax - x^2, \\text{ a maximum},\n\\]\n\nhence, taking the fluxion of the function,\n\n\\[\n\\dot{y} = a - 2x, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\dot{y}}{x} = a - 2x,\n\\]\n\ntherefore, \\( a - 2x = 0 \\), and \\( x = \\frac{a}{2} \\).\n\nThus it appears that the product of the parts will be the greatest possible, when each is half the given number.\n\nEx. 2. To find the fraction which shall exceed its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a> by the greatest quantity possible.\n\nLet \\( x \\) denote the fraction, then its cube is \\( x^3 \\), so that we have\n\n\\[\ny = x - x^3, \\text{ a maximum};\n\\]\n\ntherefore, taking the fluxion of the function,\n\n\\[\n\\dot{y} = 1 - 3x^2, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\dot{y}}{x} = 1 - 3x^2 = 0,\n\\]\n\nhence \\( 3x^2 = 1 \\), and \\( x = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} \\), the fraction required.\n\nEx. 3. To determine the greatest rectangle that can be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> in a given triangle.\n\nPut the base \\( AC \\) of the triangle \\( = b \\), and its altitude \\( BD = a \\), and let \\( B \\) \\( n \\), the altitude of the rectangle Fig. 14. \\( pqr \\), considered as variable, be denoted by \\( x \\), then, because\nbecause of the parallel lines AC, pq, it will be, as BD : AC :: Dn : pq, that is \\(a : b : a - x : pq\\), hence \\(pq = \\frac{b(a-x)}{a}\\), and the area of the rectangle, or \\(pq \\times Bn\\), will be \\(\\frac{b(a-x)x}{a}\\), therefore \\(y = \\frac{b(a-x)x}{a}\\) must be a maximum, and hence \\(y' = \\frac{ba - 2bx}{a} :\\) thus we have,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{ba - 2bx}{a} = 0,\n\\]\n\nand \\(ba - 2bx = 0\\), and \\(x = \\frac{a}{2}\\); hence it appears that the greatest inscribed rectangle is that whose altitude is half the altitude of the triangle.\n\n81. It is proper to observe that the value of a quantity, when a maximum or minimum may often be determined more readily by considering that any given multiple, or part of the function, likewise any power or root of it, must then be also a maximum or minimum. Thus in the preceding example, in which the function to be a maximum is \\(\\frac{b(a-x)x}{a}\\), we may reject the constant multiplier \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\), and then the function to be a maximum is \\(y = (a-x)x = ax - x^2\\), the fluxion of which being taken, we have \\(y' = ax - 2x\\) and \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = a - 2x = 0\\), hence \\(x = \\frac{a}{2}\\), the same value as before.\n\nEx. 4. Of all the right-angled plane triangles having the same given hypotenuse, to find that whose area is greatest.\n\nLet ABC be the triangle; put AB = a, and AC, the given hypotenuse, = a, then BC = \\(\\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)}\\), and consequently the area of the triangle is \\(\\frac{x^2(a^2 - x^2)}{4}\\), which being a maximum, its square \\(\\frac{x^2(a^2 - x^2)}{4}\\), also four times that square, or \\(x^2(a^2 - x^2)\\), will likewise be a maximum, therefore, \\(y = x^2(a^2 - x^2) = ax^3 - x^4\\), a max., hence \\(y' = 2ax^2 - 4x^3 = 0\\), and\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = 2ax^2 - 4x^3 = 0,\n\\]\n\nhence \\(2x^2 = a^2\\), and \\(x = a\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{2}}\\).\n\nEx. 5. To determine the greatest cylinder that can be inscribed in a given cone.\n\nPut AC the base of the cone = b, BH its altitude = a, and DF, the diameter of the end of the cylinder DIGF inscribed in the cone, = x. From the similar triangles BAC, BDF, we have AC : BH :: DF : BE, that is \\(b : a :: x : BE\\), hence \\(BE = \\frac{ax}{b}\\), and \\(EH = BH - BE = a - \\frac{ax}{b} = \\frac{ab - ax}{b}\\). Put c for the number .78539, then the area of the base of the cylinder is (by the Elements of Geometry) \\(c \\times DF^2\\), and its solid content \\(c \\times DF^2 \\times EH = \\frac{ca^3(b-x)}{b}\\), hence \\(\\frac{ca^3(b-x)}{b}\\) is to be a maximum, therefore, leaving out the constant multiplier \\(\\frac{ca}{b}\\), we have \\(y = x^2(b-x) = bx^2 - x^3\\), a maximum; taking now the fluxions, we get\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = 2bx - 3x^2, \\text{ and } \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 2b - 3x = 0,\n\\]\n\nhence \\(3x^2 = 2bx\\), and \\(x = \\frac{2b}{3}\\), and consequently HE = \\(\\frac{1}{3}BH\\).\n\nEx. 6. To find the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>'s place in the ecliptic, when that part of the equation of time which arises from the obliquity of the ecliptic is a maximum.\n\nLet EQ be the equator, EC the ecliptic, S the sun's place, and SA his declination, then this part of the equation of time is the difference of the sun's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> ES, and right ascension EA, turned into time. Put the arch ES = x, the arch EA = v, which is to be considered as a function of x, and put a for the cosine of the angle E = 23\u00b0 28'. Then, by Spherical Trigonometry, in the right-angled spherical triangle LAS, we have tan. EA = cot. EX tan. ES; therefore, to determine x we have tan. v = a tan. x, and \\(y = x - v\\), a maximum.\n\nFrom the second of these equations we get\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{v}{x} = 1 - \\frac{v}{x} = 0,\n\\]\n\nand from the first, by \u00a7 60,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v}{x} \\sec^2 v = ax \\sec^2 x, \\text{ and } \\frac{v}{x} = \\frac{a \\sec^2 x}{\\sec^2 v},\n\\]\n\ntherefore, \\(1 + \\frac{a \\sec^2 x}{\\sec^2 v} = 0\\), and \\(\\sec^2 v = a \\sec^2 x\\),\n\nor \\(1 + \\tan^2 v = a - a \\tan^2 x\\), but from the first equation \\(\\tan^2 v = a \\tan^2 x\\), therefore,\n\n\\[\n1 + a^2 \\tan^2 x = a + a \\tan^2 x,\n\\]\n\nor \\(a(a - 1) \\tan^2 x = a - 1\\),\n\nhence \\(\\tan x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}} = 1.04416\\), the tangent of 46\u00b0 14', the sun's longitude when this part of the equation is a maximum.\n\n83. We have deduced the rule of \u00a7 79. for determining when a function is a maximum, or minimum, from the consideration of curve lines. The whole theory of maxima and minima may however be explained in a manner purely analytical, as follows:\n\nLet us suppose that \\(y\\) is any function whatever of \\(x\\), and that \\(x\\) has acquired the value that produces the maximum or minimum of the function; then, if we suppose \\(x = h\\) and \\(x + h\\) to be substituted successively in the function instead of \\(x\\), the two resulting values ought to be both less than the maximum or both greater than the minimum value.\nLet us denote the value of the function that results from the substitution of \\( x - h \\) by \\( y \\) and that which results from the substitution of \\( x + h \\) by \\( y' \\), then by the theorem given in \u00a7 69,\n\n\\[\ny = y - \\frac{y}{x} h + \\frac{y}{x^2} h^2 + \\frac{y}{x^3} h^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny' = y + \\frac{y}{x} h + \\frac{y}{x^2} h^2 + \\frac{y}{x^3} h^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nIn each of these values, \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\), the coefficient of \\( h \\), must either be equal to some quantity, positive or negative, or else it must \\( = 0 \\). Let us suppose, if possible, that it is equal to some quantity, positive or negative; now as \\( h \\) may be conceived to be so small that the term \\( \\frac{y}{x} h \\),\n\nor any other term, shall exceed the sum of all the terms that follow it in each series, (n) if we suppose \\( h \\) to have such a value, then, because of the term \\( \\frac{y}{x} h \\) having the sign \u2014 in the one series, and + in the other, it follows that the one value of the function is greater, and the other less than \\( y \\), the maximum or minimum value: But this conclusion is inconsistent with the nature of a maximum or minimum, therefore \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\) cannot in the case of a maximum or minimum be equal to any positive or negative quantity whatever.\n\nIf however we assume \\( \\frac{y}{x} = 0 \\), so that the two values are,\n\n\\[\ny = y + \\frac{y}{x^2} h^2 + \\frac{y}{x^3} h^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny' = y + \\frac{y}{x^2} h^2 + \\frac{y}{x^3} h^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nthen as the second term \\( \\frac{y}{x^2} h^2 \\) has the same sign in both, when that term is greater than all the terms that follow\n\nit, we shall have both values greater than \\( y \\) when \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\) is positive, and both less when it is negative, the first case corresponding to a maximum, and the second to a minimum.\n\nHence, to determine the maximum or minimum of the function \\( y \\), it appears that we must take the fluxion of \\( y \\), and divide it by \\( x \\), and put the result equal to 0, which agrees with what was shown in \u00a7 79.\n\n84. Although in the case of a function admitting of a maximum or minimum we have always \\( \\frac{y}{x} = 0 \\), yet we must not conclude that conversely the one or the other of these has place every time that \\( \\frac{y}{x} = 0 \\). For if it happens that the value of \\( x \\) that renders \\( \\frac{y}{x} = 0 \\), causes also \\( \\frac{y}{x^2} \\) to vanish, without at the same time making \\( \\frac{y}{x^3} \\) to disappear, then we have\n\n\\[\ny = y - \\frac{y}{x^2} h^2 + \\frac{y}{x^3} h^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny' = y + \\frac{y}{x^2} h^2 + \\frac{y}{x^3} h^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nand as by giving a proper value to \\( h \\), \\( \\frac{y}{x^2} h^2 \\) may be rendered greater than the sum of all the following terms in each series, it follows, that \\( \\frac{y}{x^3} \\) being supposed to be any quantity either positive or negative, because of its sign being different in the two values, the one of them will be greater, and the other less than \\( y \\), the maximum or minimum value, which result is inconsistent with the nature of a maximum or minimum. If however \\( \\frac{y}{x^3} \\) be assumed \\( = 0 \\), then\n\n(d) If this should not appear sufficiently obvious, let\n\n\\[\nA + Bh + Ch^2 + Dh^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nbe such a series, where \\( A, B, C, D, \\ldots \\) denote quantities either positive or negative, but which are independent of \\( h \\). Then, writing the series thus,\n\n\\[\nh(A + Bh + Ch^2 + Dh^3 + \\ldots)\n\\]\n\nit is obvious that if \\( h \\) be conceived to be continually diminished, and at last to become \\( = 0 \\), the part\n\n\\[\nBh + Ch^2 + Dh^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwill also become \\( = 0 \\), therefore before it vanishes it will be less than \\( A \\), or any other assignable quantity, therefore \\( Bh + Ch^2 + Dh^3 + \\ldots \\) may become less than \\( A/h \\).\n\\[ y = y + \\frac{y}{x^4} \\cdot \\frac{h^4}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} + \\text{&c.} \\]\n\n\\[ y' = y + \\frac{y}{x^4} \\cdot \\frac{h^4}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} + \\text{&c.} \\]\n\nhere again, the coefficient of the second term having in both values the same sign, the conditions of the maximum or minimum are fulfilled, and the sign of \\( \\frac{y}{x^4} \\) shews when the one or the other is to have place.\n\nIt must now be sufficiently evident, without proceeding any further, that a function can only admit of a maximum or a minimum when the first of its fluxions that does not vanish, is of an even order (or is its second or fourth fluxion, &c.), and that the sign of that fluxion is negative in the case of a maximum, but positive in the case of a minimum.\n\n85. We shall conclude this theory by applying it to an example. Let \\( y \\) be such a function of \\( x \\) that\n\n\\[ y^2 - 2mxy + x^2 - a^2 = 0, \\]\n\nthen by \u00a7 49,\n\n\\[ (y - mx)y' - (my - x)x' = 0, \\]\n\nand hence\n\n\\[ \\frac{y'}{x} = \\frac{my - x}{y - mx} = 0, \\]\n\ntherefore \\( my - x = 0 \\), and \\( y = \\frac{x}{m} \\).\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), let this value of \\( y \\) be substituted in the original equation, it thus becomes\n\n\\[ x^2 - x^2 - a^2 = 0, \\]\n\nhence we find\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{ma}{\\sqrt{(1 - m^2)}}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{(1 - m^2)}}. \\]\n\nWe must now examine what is the nature of the expression for \\( \\frac{y}{x^2} \\). Taking the fluxion of the equation\n\n\\[ \\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{my - x}{y - mx}, \\]\n\nand considering that \\( x \\) is constant, we have\n\n\\[ \\frac{y'}{x} = \\frac{(1 - m^2)(xy - yx')}{(y - mx)^2}, \\]\n\ntherefore, dividing by \\( x \\),\n\n\\[ \\frac{y'}{x^2} = \\frac{x - m^2}{(y - mx)^2} \\left\\{ \\frac{y'}{x} - y \\right\\}, \\]\n\nbut as in the present case \\( \\frac{y'}{x} = 0 \\), and \\( y = \\frac{x}{m} \\), this expression becomes simply\n\n\\[ \\frac{y'}{x^2} = \\frac{-m}{x(1 - m^2)}, \\]\n\nwhich equation, by putting instead of \\( x \\) its value \\( \\frac{ma}{\\sqrt{(1 - m^2)}} \\), becomes\n\n\\[ \\frac{y'}{x^2} = \\frac{1}{a \\sqrt{(1 - m^2)}}, \\]\n\nand as this result is negative, we conclude that the value which we have found for \\( y \\) is a maximum.\n\nOf the values of fractions, the numerators and denominators of which vanish at the same time.\n\n86. There are some fractional functions of such a nature, that by giving a particular value to the variable quantity, both the numerator and denominator of the fraction vanish, and thus the fraction is reduced to this form \\( \\frac{O}{O} \\), an expression from which nothing can be concluded. We have an example of this in the fraction \\( \\frac{x-a}{x^2-a^2} \\), which, by supposing \\( x = a \\) becomes \\( \\frac{a-a}{a^2-a^2} = \\frac{0}{0} \\); we must not however conclude that the fraction has no determinate value in this particular case, for if we consider that its numerator and denominator have a common divisor, viz. \\( x-a \\), it is evident that by taking this divisor out of both, the fraction \\( \\frac{x-a}{x^2-a^2} = \\frac{x-a}{(x-a)(x+a)} \\)\n\nbecomes \\( \\frac{1}{x+a} \\), an expression, which in the case of \\( x = a \\) is equal to \\( \\frac{1}{2a} \\).\n\n87. In general, if we make \\( x = a \\) in an expression of this form \\( \\frac{P(x-a)^m}{Q(x-a)^n} \\), it becomes \\( \\frac{0}{0} \\); however its true value is either nothing, or finite, or infinite, according as \\( m > n \\), or \\( m = n \\), or \\( m < n \\); for by taking out the factors common to the numerator and denominator, the fraction becomes \\( \\frac{P(x-a)^{m-n}}{Q} \\) in the first case, \\( \\frac{P}{Q} \\) in the second, and \\( \\frac{P}{Q(x-a)^{n-m}} \\) in the third; here we suppose that \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are such functions as neither become nothing, nor infinite, by the supposition of \\( x = a \\).\n\n88. Therefore, when by giving a particular value to \\( x \\) a function of that quantity assumes the form \\( \\frac{0}{0} \\), to discover the true value of the function in this particular case, we must disengage the factors which are common to the numerator and denominator. This may be done in most cases by finding their common measure (Algebra, \u00a7 49.) but the direct method of fluxions furnishes us with another method.\n\nIn the expression \\( P(x-a) \\), where \\( P \\) denotes any function of \\( x \\) that is independent of \\( x-a \\), if we suppose \\( x = a \\), then the expression vanishes; the fluxion however of the expression, viz. \\( (x-a)P + Px \\), is a quantity which does not vanish when \\( x = a \\), but is then reduced to its last term, that is to \\( Px \\).\nDirect Method.\n\nAgain, the function \\( P(x-a)^n \\) vanishes by supposing \\( x = a \\), but if we take its fluxion, viz. \\((x-a)^n \\dot{P} + 2(x-a) \\dot{P} x + 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot P \\ddot{x}^2 \\), an expression which does not vanish upon the hypothesis of \\( x = a \\), but is reduced to its last term, viz. \\( 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot P \\ddot{x}^2 \\). By proceeding in this manner, it is easy to see that by taking the fluxion of a function of the form \\( P(x-a)^m \\) \\( m \\) times successively (\\( m \\) being a whole number) we shall finally obtain an expression, all the terms of which, except the last, vanish by supposing that \\( x = a \\); and that the last term will be \\( 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots m \\cdot P \\ddot{x}^m \\), an expression free from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTOR\">factor</a> \\((x-a)^m \\), and involving only the function \\( P \\).\n\n89. It is not necessary that we should know the number \\( n \\), nor that we should exhibit the factor \\((x-a)^n \\), in order to determine when the expression \\( P(x-a)^n \\) is freed from that factor. We have only to ascertain after each operation of taking the fluxion, whether the result vanishes or not, when we substitute \\( a \\) instead of \\( x \\); for in the last case the operation is finished, and the result is the quantity \\( 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots P \\ddot{x}^m \\). Suppose for example the function to be \\( x^3 - ax^2 - a^2x + a^3 \\), which vanishes when \\( x = a \\); its first fluxion also vanishes when \\( x = a \\), but not its second fluxion, which is \\((6x-2a)x^2 \\), hence we may conclude that the function has the form \\( P(x-a)^2 \\), which is besides obvious, because\n\n\\[ x^3 - ax^2 - a^2x + a^3 = (x+a)(x-a)^2. \\]\n\n90. In applying these observations to the fraction \\( \\frac{P(x-a)^m}{Q(x-a)^n} \\), it appears, that by repeating the operation of taking the fluxions of its numerator and denominator, they will be freed at once from the factor \\( x-a \\), if \\( m=n \\). If a result, which does not vanish, be obtained first from the numerator, then we may be assured, that the factor \\((x-a)\\) is found in the numerator raised to a less power than in the denominator, and in this case the fraction is infinite when \\( x=a \\). If on the contrary the first result that does not vanish is found from the denominator, then the numerator contains a higher power of \\((x-a)\\) than the denominator, and in this case, when \\( x=a \\), the fraction vanishes.\n\nThe rule for finding the value of a function which becomes \\( \\frac{0}{0} \\) by giving a particular value to \\( x \\) may therefore be expressed thus. Take the successive fluxions of both the numerator and denominator until a result which does not vanish be obtained from either the one or the other, or from both at the same time; in the first case the function is infinite, in the second it is equal to 0, and in the last case its value is finite.\n\n91. We proceed to illustrate this rule by a few examples.\n\nEx. 1. The value of the function \\( \\frac{x^3-1}{x^2-1} \\) is required when \\( x=1 \\).\n\nThe fluxion of the numerator is \\( 3x^2 \\), and that of the denominator is \\( 2x \\), neither of which quantities vanish when \\( x=1 \\), therefore in this particular case, the value of the fraction is \\( \\frac{3x^2}{2x} = \\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\nEx. 2. Suppose the fraction to be \\( \\frac{ax^2-2acx+ac^2}{bx^2-2bcx+bc^2} \\), which vanishes when \\( x=c \\).\n\nBy taking the fluxions of the numerator and denominator we obtain \\( \\frac{2ax-2ac}{2bx-2bc} = \\frac{a-x-ac}{b-x-bc} \\), a fraction, the numerator and denominator of which still vanish upon the hypothesis of \\( x=c \\), we therefore take the fluxions a second time, and get \\( \\frac{2ax^2}{2bx^2} = \\frac{a}{b} \\) for the value of the proposed fraction in the particular case of \\( x=c \\).\n\nEx. 3. Suppose the fraction to be \\( \\frac{x^3-ax^2+a^2x-a^3}{x^2-a^2} \\), which vanishes when \\( x=a \\). In this example, by taking the fluxions of the numerator and denominator once, we get\n\n\\[ \\frac{3x^2-2ax+a^2}{2x} = \\frac{3x^2-2ax+a^2}{2x}, \\]\n\nan expression, of which only the numerator vanishes upon the supposition of \\( x=a \\), hence we may conclude the true value of the fraction in this case to be 0.\n\nThe contrary happens in the fraction\n\n\\[ \\frac{ax-n^2}{a^2-2an+2an^2-n^4}; \\]\n\nwe may therefore conclude that when \\( x=a \\) this last fraction becomes infinite.\n\n92. The rule of \u00a7 90 can only be applied when the factors common to the numerator and denominator are integer powers of \\( x-a \\), or as by taking the fluxions, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a> of \\((x-a)^m\\) is diminished by an unit at each operation; when \\( m \\) is a fraction we shall at last arrive at a result containing negative powers of \\( x-a \\), which therefore, when \\( x=a \\), will become infinite. The following mode of proceeding will however apply to all cases whatever.\n\nLet \\( X \\) be a fraction of which the numerator and denominator both vanish when \\( x=a \\); by substituting in it \\( a+h \\) instead of \\( x \\), the functions \\( X \\) and \\( X' \\) may be expanded into a series of this form,\n\n\\[ A h^\\alpha + B h^\\beta + \\&c., \\quad A' h'^\\alpha + B' h'^\\beta + \\&c. \\]\n\nwhich are ascending, that is, having the exponents of the powers positive and increasing; because the series must become 0, upon the hypothesis that \\( h=0 \\). We have therefore\n\n\\[ \\frac{A h^\\alpha + B h^\\beta + \\&c.}{A' h'^\\alpha + B' h'^\\beta + \\&c.} \\]\n\ninstead of the proposed fraction.\nNow if \\(a = a'\\), by dividing the numerator and denominator of this expression by the factor \\(h\\), which is common to all the terms of each, it becomes\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A + B h^2 - a'}{A' + B h^3 - a'} + \\text{&c.}\n\\]\n\na quantity which, by supposing \\(h = 0\\), is reduced to \\(\\frac{0}{A'}\\), that is to 0. If again \\(a = a'\\), the expression for the fraction, after dividing the numerator and denominator by \\(h\\), is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A + B h^2 - a'}{A' + B h^3 - a'} + \\text{&c.}\n\\]\n\nwhich, by supposing \\(h\\) to be \\(= 0\\), becomes simply \\(\\frac{A}{A'}\\), a finite quantity. If, however, \\(a < a'\\), then the expression for the fraction is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A + B h^2 - a'}{A h^2 - a'} + \\text{&c.}\n\\]\n\nwhich, when \\(h = 0\\), becomes \\(\\frac{A}{0}\\), an expression which may be considered as infinite. Thus it appears that in each case the true value of the fraction depends only on \\(A\\) and \\(A'\\), the first terms of the series.\n\nThe following rule is applicable to every function that can appear under the indeterminate form \\(\\frac{0}{0}\\).\n\nFind the first term of each of the ascending series which express the developments of the numerator and denominator when \\(a + h\\) is substituted in them instead of \\(x\\). Reduce the new function formed of these first terms to its most simple form, and make \\(h = 0\\); the results shall be the different values of the proposed function when \\(x\\) is made equal to \\(a\\).\n\nExample. Suppose the function to be\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{x} - \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{(x-a)}}{\\sqrt{(x^2-a^2)}},\n\\]\n\nwhich, when \\(x = a\\), becomes \\(\\frac{0}{0}\\). By substituting \\(a + h\\) instead of \\(x\\), and developing the results into series, the numerator becomes \\(h^2 + \\frac{h}{2\\sqrt{a}} + \\text{&c.}\\) and the denominator \\(\\sqrt{2a} h^2 + \\frac{h}{2\\sqrt{2a}} + \\text{&c.}\\). Taking now the first term of each series, we have \\(\\frac{h^2}{2\\sqrt{2a}} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2a}}\\), an expression in which \\(h\\) is not found; therefore the value of the function is \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2a}}\\), when \\(x = a\\).\n\nOf the Radii of Curvature.\n\n93. Let HC'CF represent a material curve, or mould. Let a thread be fastened to it at H, and made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> along the curve, so as to coincide with it in its whole extent from H to F. Let the thread be now unlooped or evolved from the curve, then its extremity F will describe another curve line FAPP'. The curve HCF is called the Evolute of the curve FAP; and the curve FAP is called the Involute of the curve HCF.\n\n94. From this mode of conceiving the curve to be generated, we may draw the following conclusions.\n\n1st. Suppose PC to be a portion of the thread detached from the evolute, then PC will be a tangent to the evolute at C.\n\n2dly. The line PC will be perpendicular to a tangent to the curve FAP at the point P, or will be a normal to the curve at that point. For the point P may be considered as describing at the same time an element of the curve FAP, and an element of a circle \\(qPq'\\) whose momentary centre is C, and which has PC for its radius.\n\n3dly. That part of the curve between F and P, which is described with radii all of which are shorter than CP is more incurvated than a circle described on P as a centre, with a radius equal to CP. And in like manner PP', the part of the curve on the other side of P, which is described with radii greater than PC, is less incurvated than that circle.\n\n4thly. The circle \\(qPq'\\) has the same curvature as the curve APP' itself has at P; hence it is called an Equicurve circle, and its radius PC is called the Radius of Curvature at the point C.\n\n95. We are now to investigate how the radius of curvature at any point in FAP any proposed curve may be found.\n\nLet AB and BP be the co-ordinates at P any point in the curve, and PC its radius of curvature; and let PC meet AB in E. Put the abscissa \\(AB = x\\), the ordinate \\(BP = y\\), the arch \\(AP = z\\), the angle AEP (that is, the arch which measures that angle, radius being unity) \\(= v\\), the radius of curvature \\(PC = r\\). Take P' another point in the curve, and let \\(P'C'\\) be the radius of curvature at that point. Let \\(P'C'\\) meet \\(AB\\) in \\(E'\\), and PC in D, and on D as a centre, with a radius \\(= r\\), describe an arch of a circle, meeting the radii PC, \\(P'C'\\) in m and n. Then the arch \\(PP'\\) will be the increment of \\(z\\); and since the angle \\(PDP'\\) is the difference of the angles \\(<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEA\">PEA</a>, P'E'A\\), the arch \\(m n\\) will be the corresponding increment of \\(v\\).\n\nSuppose now the point \\(P'\\) to approach continually to \\(P\\), then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> \\(C'\\) and \\(D\\) will approach to \\(C\\), and the ratio of the arch \\(PP'\\), the increment of \\(z\\), to the arch \\(m n\\) the increment of \\(v\\), will approach to the ratio of CP to \\(C m\\), that is to the ratio of \\(r\\) to 1; therefore the ratio of \\(r\\) to 1 is the limit of the ratio of \\(PP'\\) to \\(mn\\), or \\(r = \\lim_{PP' \\to mn} \\frac{PP'}{mn}\\), and passing to the ratio of the fluxions, \\(r = \\lim_{PP' \\to mn} \\frac{PP'}{mn}\\), thus we have obtained a formula expressing the radius of curvature, by means of the fluxion of the arch of the curve, and the fluxion of the angle which a normal to the curve makes with the line of the abscissas. We proceed to deduce from this formula other\nother expressions which may involve the fluxions of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) only.\n\n96. Because PE is a normal to the curve at E, the tangent of the angle PEA or \\( v \\) is equal to \\( \\frac{x}{y} \\) (\\$75.), put \\( \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\dot{y}} = i \\), then because tan. \\( v = t \\), we have by taking the fluxions (\\$60.), \\( \\dot{v} \\) fec. \\( ^2 \\) \\( v = i \\), but fec. \\( ^2 \\) \\( v = -\\frac{1}{t} \\tan. \\( ^2 \\) \\( v \\) \\( = 1 + \\frac{\\dot{x}^2}{\\dot{y}^2} = \\frac{x^2 + y^2}{y^2} \\) (\\$63.), therefore \\( \\frac{\\dot{v}}{\\dot{y}^2} = i \\)\n\nand \\( \\dot{v} = \\frac{\\dot{y}^2}{x^2} \\).\n\nSubstituting now this value of \\( \\dot{v} \\) in the formula \\( r = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\dot{v}} \\)\n\nit becomes \\( r = \\frac{\\dot{x}^3}{\\dot{y}^3} \\).\n\nIf we now recollect that \\( t = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\dot{y}} \\), and that \\( \\dot{x}^2 = \\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 \\), it will appear that this other expression which we have found for \\( r \\) involves in effect the fluxions of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) only.\n\n97. In computing the values of \\( t = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\dot{y}} \\), and \\( \\frac{\\dot{x}^3}{\\dot{y}^3} \\) we may consider any two of the three quantities \\( x, y, z \\), as a function of the remaining quantity; and upon that hypothesis compute their fluxions.\n\nThus if we suppose that \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) are functions of \\( x \\), then, as in taking the fluxions of \\( y, t, \\) and \\( z \\), we must consider \\( x \\) as a given or constant quantity, from the equation \\( t = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\dot{y}} \\) we have \\( i = -\\frac{\\dot{x}^2}{\\dot{y}^2} \\) (\\$39.), and substituting this value of \\( i \\) in \\( \\frac{\\dot{x}^3}{\\dot{y}^3} \\), the value last found for \\( r \\), it becomes\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{\\dot{x}^3}{\\dot{y}^3} = \\frac{(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{\\dot{x}^2} \\]\n\nIf again, instead of considering \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) as functions of \\( x \\), we consider \\( x \\) and \\( z \\) as functions of \\( y \\), then from the equation \\( t = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\dot{y}} \\) (as \\( \\dot{y} \\) must now be reckoned constant),\n\nwe get \\( i = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\dot{y}} \\), thus the formula \\( r = \\frac{\\dot{x}^3}{\\dot{y}^3} \\) becomes\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{\\dot{x}^3}{\\dot{y}^3} = \\frac{(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{\\dot{x}^2} \\]\n\nWe shall now apply these formulae to some examples.\n\n98. Example 1.\u2014It is required to find the general expression for the radius of curvature of a parabola.\n\nThe equation of the parabola is \\( y = a^{\\frac{1}{2}} x^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\), there-\n\nfore, \\( \\dot{y} = \\frac{a^{\\frac{1}{2}} x^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{2 x^{\\frac{1}{2}}} \\), and, making \\( \\dot{x} \\) constant,\n\n\\[ \\dot{y} = \\frac{-a^{\\frac{1}{2}} x^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{4 x^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\]\n\ntherefore, \\( \\dot{x} = \\sqrt{(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2)} \\)\n\n\\[ \\dot{x} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{4a^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x} \\right) \\]\n\nand, putting \\( r \\) for the radius of curvature,\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{\\dot{x}^3}{\\dot{y}^3} = \\frac{(a + 4x)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{2 \\sqrt{a}} \\]\n\nIf in this general expression, we put \\( x = 0 \\), we find \\( \\frac{a^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{2 \\sqrt{a}} = \\frac{1}{2} a \\) for the radius of curvature at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a> of the curve.\n\nEx. 2. Suppose the curve to be an ellipse, required as in the last example.\n\nPutting \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) to denote the two axes, the equation of the ellipse is \\( a^2 y^2 = c^2 (a x - x^2) \\). Therefore taking the first and second fluxions, we have \\( 2 a^2 y \\dot{y} = c^2 \\dot{x} (a - 2x) \\),\n\nand \\( 2 a^2 \\dot{y}^2 + 2 a^2 y \\ddot{y} = -2 c^2 x \\dot{x} \\); whence \\( \\dot{y} = \\frac{c^2 \\dot{x} (a - 2x)}{2 a^2 y} \\), and \\( \\dot{y} = \\frac{a^2 \\dot{y}^2 + c^2 \\dot{x}^2}{a^2 y} \\), which expressions, by substituting the values of \\( y \\) and \\( \\dot{y} \\) become\n\n\\[ \\dot{y} = \\frac{c \\dot{x} (a - 2x)}{2a \\sqrt{(ax - x^2)}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\dot{y} = \\frac{a^2 c^2 \\dot{x} (a - 2x)^2}{4 a^3 c (a x - x^2) \\sqrt{(a x - x^2)}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\dot{y} = \\frac{c \\dot{x} (a - 2x)^2}{4 (a x - x^2) \\sqrt{(a x - x^2)}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\dot{y} = \\frac{c \\dot{x}^3}{4 (a x - x^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\]\n\ntherefore,\n\n\\[ \\dot{x} = \\sqrt{(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2)} \\]\n\n\\[ \\dot{x} = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{c^2 \\dot{x}^2 (a - 2x)^2}{4 a^2 (a x - x^2)} + \\dot{x}^2 \\right)} \\]\n\n\\[ \\dot{x} = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{2a} \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{c^2 \\dot{x}^2 + (a^2 - c^2) (a x - x^2)^2}{a x - x^2} \\right)} \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{\\dot{x}^3}{\\dot{y}^3} = \\frac{(a^2 c^2 + 4 (a^2 - c^2) (a x - x^2)^2)}{2 a^4 c} \\]\n\nwhich expression, when \\( x = 0 \\), becomes simply \\( \\frac{c^2}{2a} \\), the radius of curvature at the vertices of the transverse axis; but when \\( x = \\frac{a}{2} \\), it becomes \\( \\frac{a^2}{2c} \\), the radius of curvature at the vertices of the conjugate axis.\nPART II. THE INVERSE METHOD OF FLUXIONS.\n\n99. AS the Direct Method of fluxions treats of finding the relation between the fluxions of variable quantities, having given the relation subsisting between the quantities themselves; so the Inverse Method treats of finding the relation subsisting between the variable quantities, having given the relation of their fluxions.\n\nWhatever be the relation between variable quantities, we can in every case assign the relation of their fluxions; therefore the direct method of fluxions may in this respect be considered as perfect. But it is not the same with the inverse method, for there are no direct and general rules, by which we can in every case determine from the relation of the fluxions, that of their flowing quantities or fluents. All we can do is to compare any proposed fluxion with such fluxions as are derived from known fluents by the rules of the direct method, and if we find it to have the same form as one of these, we may conclude that the fluents of both, or at least the variable parts of these fluents, are identical.\n\n100. In the direct method we have shewn, that by proper transformations, the finding of the fluxion of any proposed function is reducible to the finding of the fluxions of a few simple functions, and of the sums, or products, or quotients of such functions. In like manner, in the inverse method we must endeavour to transform complex fluxionary expressions into others more simple, so as to reduce them, if possible, to some fluxion, the fluent of which we already know.\n\nSect. I. Of the Fluents of Fluxions involving one variable quantity.\n\n101. As when $y$ is such a function of a variable quantity $x$, that $y = A x^m + C$, where $A$, $m$ and $C$ denote constant quantities, we find by the direct method (\u00a7 36. and \u00a7 26.) that $\\dot{y} = m A x^{m-1} \\dot{x}$, or (putting $a$ instead of $m A$, and $n$ instead of $m-1$), $\\dot{y} = a x^n \\dot{x}$; so on the contrary, as often as we have the fluxional equation\n\n$$\\dot{y} = a x^n \\dot{x},$$\n\nwe may conclude that the relation of the fluents is expressed by the equation\n\n$$y = \\frac{a x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C,$$\n\nfor by substituting $m A$ instead of $a$, and $m-1$ instead of $n$ in this equation, it becomes $y = A x^m + C$, the same equation as that from which the fluxional equation was derived.\n\n102. The value of the constant quantity $C$, which is generally called by writers on fluxions, the correction of the fluent, is to be determined from the particular inquiry in which the fluxional equation $\\dot{y} = a x^n \\dot{x}$ occurs. If it be known that $y = 0$, when $x$ acquires some known magnitude, which may be denoted by $b$, then the general equation $y = \\frac{a x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$, becomes in that particular case\n\n$$0 = \\frac{a b^{n+1}}{n+1} + C;$$\n\nHence, by subtracting each side of this last equation from the corresponding side of the former, we get\n\n$$y = \\frac{a (x^{n+1} - b^{n+1})}{n+1}$$\n\nan equation that is independent of the constant and arbitrary quantity $C$.\n\n103. By giving particular values to $n$ in the fluxional equation $\\dot{y} = a x^n \\dot{x}$, and in that of the fluents $y = \\frac{a (x^{n+1} - b^{n+1})}{n+1}$, we may obtain particular fluxional equations, and corresponding equations of the fluents. There is, however, one case which requires to be noticed; it is when $n = -1$; then the equation of the fluxions is $\\dot{y} = a x^{-1} \\dot{x} = \\frac{a \\dot{x}}{x}$, and that of the fluents, according to the general formula $y = \\frac{a (x^{n+1} - b^{n+1})}{n+1}$\n\n$$= \\frac{a (x^0 - b^0)}{0} = \\frac{a (1 - 1)}{0} = 0,$$\n\nbut from this expression it is manifest, that nothing can be concluded. The value of the function $\\frac{a (x^{n+1} - b^{n+1})}{n+1}$, in the particular case of $n+1 = 0$, may be found by the rule given in \u00a7 90 for determining the value of a function when it assumes the form $\\frac{0}{0}$; but it may be otherwise found by proceeding thus. Put $n+1 = m$, and let $p = \\log_e x$, and $q = \\log_e b$; then, by the formula of \u00a7 54,\n\n$$x^m = 1 + p m + \\frac{p^2 m^2}{2} + &c.,$$\n\n$$b^m = 1 + q m + \\frac{q^2 m^2}{2} + &c.,$$\n\nand therefore\n\n$$x^m - b^m = (p-q) m + \\left(\\frac{(p-q)^2}{2}\\right) m^2 + &c.,$$\n\nand $$\\frac{x^m - b^m}{m} = (p-q) + \\left(\\frac{(p-q)^2}{2}\\right) m + &c.$$\nThus we have $\\frac{a^m - b^m}{m}$ or $\\frac{a^{n+1} - b^{n+1}}{n+1}$ expressed generally by a series, all the terms of which, except the first, being multiplied by $m$ or $n+1$, will vanish when $n+1=0$, or when $n=-1$, hence it appears, that the general equation $y = \\frac{a(x^n + bx^{n+1})}{n+1}$ becomes in the particular case of $n=-1$, $y = a(p-q)$, which, substituting for $p$ and $q$ their values, and observing that\n\n$$\\log_e x \\log_e b = \\frac{1}{\\log_e e} \\times \\log_e \\frac{x}{b},$$\n\nbecomes\n\n$$y = \\frac{a}{\\log_e e} \\times \\log_e \\frac{x}{b},$$\n\nwhere $\\log_e e$, and $\\log_e \\frac{x}{b}$ are to be taken according to the same system, which may be any system of logarithms whatever. So that if we take the Napierian system, in which $\\log_e e = 1$, then\n\n$$y = a \\cdot \\frac{x}{b} = a \\cdot x - a \\cdot b = a \\cdot x + C,$$\n\nwhere $C$ denotes a constant quantity, and where the letter $l$, in this formula, and in others in which it may occur, is put as an abbreviation of the words Napierian logarithm, so that by $a \\cdot l \\cdot x$ is meant $a$ multiplied by the Napierian logarithm of $x$, &c.\n\nThis expression which we have found for the value of $y$ in the particular case of $y = ax^{-1}x$, or $\\frac{ax}{x}$, coincides with what we might have found by considering that when $y = 1 \\cdot x$, it has been shewn ($\u00a7 57$) that $y = \\frac{x}{x}$; so that conversely, when $y = \\frac{ax}{x}$, we may conclude that $y = a \\cdot x + C$ where $C$ denotes a constant quantity, to be determined from the particular question in which the fluxional equation may occur.\n\n104. It must now be evident that if\n\n$$y = ax^m + bx^n + cx^p + \\ldots + C,$$\n\nwhere $m$, $n$, $p$, &c. are constant numbers, then\n\n$$y = \\frac{ax^{m+1}}{m+1} + \\frac{bx^{n+1}}{n+1} + \\frac{cx^{p+1}}{p+1} + \\ldots + C;$$\n\nhere $C$ denotes a constant arbitrary quantity that may be considered as the sum of the constant quantities which ought to be added to the terms $\\frac{ax^{m+1}}{m+1}$, $\\frac{bx^{n+1}}{n+1}$, &c., each being regarded as a distinct fluent.\n\n105. In general, since that when\n\n$$y = at + bv + cu + \\ldots + C,$$\n\nwhere $t$, $v$, $u$, &c. denote any functions of a variable quantity, and $C$ a constant quantity, we have ($\u00a7 35$, and \u00a7 36.)\n\n$$y = at + bv + cu + \\ldots + C.$$\n\nSo on the contrary, if we have any fluxional equation of this last form, we may conclude that\n\n$$y = at + bv + cu + \\ldots + C.$$\n\nAnd since that when $u = v + C$, where $u$, $v$ and $t$ denote any function of a variable quantity, and $C$ a constant quantity, we have ($\u00a7 37$), $u = v + tv$, so on the contrary, if\n\n$$u = v + tv,$$\n\nwe may conclude that\n\n$$u = v + C,$$\n\nand in like manner if we have,\n\n$$\\frac{tv}{t} = \\frac{v}{t},$$\n\nwe may infer from ($\u00a7 39$) that\n\n$$u = \\frac{v}{t} + C.$$\n\n106. It is often convenient to denote the fluent of a fluxional expression without actually exhibiting that fluent. For this purpose we shall employ the sign $\\int$, putting it before the fluxion whose fluent we mean to denote. Thus, by the expression $\\int ax^n x$, is to be understood the fluent of $ax^n x$; and as this fluent has been found to be $\\frac{ax^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$, we may express this conclusion in symbols shortly thus,\n\n$$\\int ax^n x = \\frac{ax^{n+1}}{n+1} + C.$$\n\n107. Suppose we have $y = (ax + b)^m x$, we may expand $(ax + b)^m$ into a series, and multiply the series by $x$, and find the fluent of each term of the result. But we may also find the fluent of this expression without employing the development of $(ax + b)^m$, by proceeding thus. Put $ax + b = z$, then $x = \\frac{z-b}{a}$, and $x = \\frac{z}{a}$.\n\nSubstitute now these values of $ax + b$, and $x$, in the expression for $y$, and it becomes $y = \\frac{z^{m+1}}{a}$; hence we have ($\u00a7 101$) $y = \\frac{z^{m+1}}{a(m+1)} + C$, and consequently, by substituting $(ax + b)$ for $z$,\n\n$$y = \\frac{(ax + b)^{m+1}}{a(m+1)} + C.$$\n\n108. Suppose that $y = (ax^n + b)^m x^n - 1$. By putting as before $ax^n + b = z$, we have $nax^n - 1x^n = z$, and $x^n = \\frac{z}{na}$; hence $y = \\frac{z^{m+1}}{na} + C$, and, substituting for $z$ its value $ax^n + b$,\nLet us now consider fractional functions, and to begin with a simple case, let us suppose that \\( y = \\frac{Ax^n}{(ax+b)^n} \\). Put \\( ax + b = z \\), then \\( x = \\frac{z - b}{a} \\), and consequently,\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{A(z-b)^n}{a^n + z^n};\n\\]\n\nWe have now only to find the development of \\((z-b)^n\\), to multiply each of its terms by \\( z \\) and divide it by \\( z^n \\), and take the fluent of the result.\n\nLet us take for example the case of \\( m = 3 \\), and \\( n = 2 \\), then\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{A(z-b)^3}{a^4 z^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{A}{a^4} \\left\\{ z^3 - 3b^2z + 3b^3z^{-1} - b^4z^{-2} \\right\\}\n\\]\n\nHence, taking the fluents of the several terms, as in \u00a7 105, we have\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{A}{a^4} \\left\\{ \\frac{z^3}{2} - 3b^2z + 3b^3z^{-1} + b^4z^{-2} \\right\\} + C.\n\\]\n\nLet us now restore the value of \\( z \\), and then it appears, that when\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{Ax^n}{(ax+b)^m},\n\\]\n\nthen, we may write the equation thus,\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{Ax^n}{(ax+b)^m} + \\frac{Bx^n}{(ax+b)^m} + \\frac{Cx^n}{(ax+b)^m} + \\ldots + C,\n\\]\n\nand take the fluent of each term, in the same manner as we have found the fluent of \\( \\frac{Ax^n}{(ax+b)^m} \\).\n\nOf the Fluents of rational Fractions.\n\nEvery fluxion that is a rational fraction is comprehended under this general formula,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(Ax^n + Bx^n + Cx^n + \\ldots + C)}{Ax^n + Bx^n + Cx^n + \\ldots + C},\n\\]\n\nwhich, by putting \\( U \\) to denote the expression between the parentheses in the numerator, and \\( V \\) the denominator, may be represented by \\( \\frac{Ux}{V} \\). Now in the first place, we remark that the greatest exponent of the powers of \\( x \\) in the numerator may be supposed to be less than that of its powers in the denominator. For if it were not so, by dividing \\( U \\) by \\( V \\), and calling \\( Q \\) the quotient, and \\( R \\) the remainder, we should have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Ux}{V} = Qx + \\frac{R}{V},\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{Ux}{V} = \\int Qx + \\int \\frac{R}{V}.\n\\]\n\nNow, \\( Q \\) being a rational and integer function, \\( \\int Qx \\) may be found, as in \u00a7 101, and it only remains to find \\( \\int \\frac{R}{V} \\), an expression in which the highest exponent of the powers of \\( x \\) in \\( R \\) is less by unity than in \\( V \\); so that the fraction \\( \\frac{R}{V} \\) may be generally expressed thus,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(Ax^n + Bx^n + Cx^n + \\ldots + T)x}{x^n + A'x^{n-1} + B'x^{n-2} + C'x^{n-3} \\ldots + T'}.\n\\]\n\nThe general method of finding the fluent of a fractional expression of this form consists in decomposing it into a series of other fractions, the denominators of which are more simple. These fractions may be found by proceeding as follows: By putting the denominator of the proposed fraction equal to 0, we get this equation,\n\n\\[\nx^n + A'x^{n-1} + B'x^{n-2} \\ldots + T' = 0.\n\\]\n\nSuppose now that the roots of this equation are found, and that they are denoted by\n\n\\[\n-a, -a', -a'', -a''', \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhich quantities we shall suppose in the first place, are all unequal. Then the expression which has been assumed as equal to 0, may (ALGEBRA, Sect. X.) be considered as the product of \\( n \\) factors\n\n\\[\nx + a, x + a', x + a'', x + a''',\n\\]\n\nLet the proposed fraction \\( \\frac{R}{V} \\) be now assumed as equal to the sum of the simple fractions\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N}{x+a}, \\frac{N'}{x+a'}, \\frac{N''}{x+a''}, \\ldots\n\\]\n\nhaving for their denominators the simple factors of the denominator of the proposed fraction, and for their numerators quantities which are constant, but as yet are indetermined.\n\nThat we may avoid complicated calculations, and present a determinate object to the mind, let us suppose that the fluxion of which we are to find the fluent is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(Ax^2 + Bx + C)x}{x^3 + A'x^2 + B'x + C'},\n\\]\n\nand that we have by the resolution of the cubic equation \\( x^3 + A'x^2 + B'x + C' = 0 \\) found\n\n\\[\nx^3 + A'x^2 + B'x + C' = (x+a)(x+a')(x+a'').\n\\]\nThe fractions\n\n\\[ \\frac{N}{x+a}, \\frac{N'}{x+a'}, \\frac{N''}{x+a''} \\]\n\nwhen reduced to a common denominator are\n\n\\[ \\frac{N(x+a')(x+a'')}{(x+a)(x+a')(x+a'')}, \\frac{N'(x+a)(x+a'')}{(x+a)(x+a')(x+a'')} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{N''(x+a)(x+a')}{(x+a)(x+a')(x+a'')} \\]\n\nThe common denominator of these fractions is the same as that of the proposed fraction, and each of the numerators, as well as their sum, is a function of \\( x \\) of a degree lower than the denominator, that is, in the present case, it is a function of the second degree. By taking the actual products of the factors in the numerators, and adding the results, we find the sum of the fractions equal to\n\n\\[ V = \\left\\{ \\frac{(N+N'+N'')x^3}{x+a} + \\left\\{ N(a+a') + N'(a+a') + N''(a+a') \\right\\} x \\right\\} \\]\n\nwhere \\( V \\) denotes the common denominator \\((x+a)(x+a')(x+a'')=x^3+A'x^2+B'x+C'\\). Setting aside the factor \\( \\frac{x}{V} \\) of the above expression, we are now to compare that part of it which involves the three indeterminate quantities \\( N, N', N'' \\), with \\( A'x^2+B'x+C' \\), the numerator of the proposed fraction, thus we obtain these three equations\n\n\\[ N+N'+N''=A, \\]\n\\[ N(a+a') + N'(a+a') + N''(a+a')=B, \\]\n\\[ Na'a''+N'a'a''+N''a'=C. \\]\n\nBy these equations, which are all of the first degree, we may determine the values of \\( N, N', N'' \\), and thus we have the proposed fraction\n\n\\[ \\frac{(Ax^2+Bx+C)x}{x^3+A'x^2+B'x+C'} \\]\n\nequal to\n\n\\[ \\frac{Nx}{x+a} + \\frac{N'x}{x+a'} + \\frac{N''x}{x+a''} \\]\n\nwhere \\( N, N', N'' \\), and \\( a, a', a'' \\), are constant and known quantities.\n\nPut \\( x+a=z \\), then \\( x=z-a \\), and the fraction \\( \\frac{Nx}{x+a} \\) is transformed to \\( \\frac{Nz}{z} \\), of which the fluent is \\( N1.z=N1. \\)\n\n\\[ (x+a) (\\S 103). \\] In like manner we find \\( \\int \\frac{N'x}{x+a'} = N'1.(x+a') \\), and \\( \\int \\frac{N''x}{x+a''} = N''1.(x+a'') \\), and consequently\n\n\\[ \\int \\frac{(Ax^2+Bx+C)x}{x^3+A'x^2+B'x+C'} = N1.(x+a)+N'1.(x+a') + N''1.(x+a'') + \\text{const}. \\]\n\n\\[ = 1. \\left\\{ (x+a)^N(x+a')^{N'}(x+a'')^{N''} \\right\\} + \\text{const}. \\]\n\nwhere by const. is meant a constant quantity.\n\nIt is easy to extend this mode of proceeding to the general formula given at the beginning of this \u00a7; and it is obvious, that as often as the denominator of a rational fraction can be decomposed into real and unequal factors, the determination of the fluent of that fraction is attended with no other difficulty than this decomposition, which requires the numerical resolution of equations.\n\n112. We have supposed that the factors of the denominator of the proposed fraction are unequal among themselves, and it is only when this is the case that the fraction can be decomposed into others, having all this form \\( \\frac{N}{x+a} \\). If we suppose that the denominator \\( x^n+A'x^{n-1}+B'x^{n-2}+\\ldots+T' \\) has a factor of the form \\((x+a)^p\\), then the proposed fraction\n\n\\[ \\frac{(Ax^{n-1}+Bx^{n-2}+Cx^{n-3}+\\ldots+T)x}{x^n+A'x^{n-1}+B'x^{n-2}+C'x^{n-3}+\\ldots+T} \\]\n\nmust be assumed equal to\n\n\\[ \\frac{(P_{x^{p-1}}+Q_{x^{p-2}}+R_{x^{p-3}}+\\ldots+Y)x}{(x+a)^p} \\]\n\n\\[ + \\frac{N'x}{x+a'} + \\frac{N''x}{x+a''} \\ldots \\]\n\nwhere \\( P, Q, R, \\ldots, Y, N, N', \\ldots \\) denotes indeterminate but constant quantities, and \\( x+a, x+a', x+a'' \\), &c., are the remaining factors of the denominator of the proposed fraction. To determine the quantities \\( P, Q, R, \\ldots, Y, N, N', \\ldots \\) we must now proceed in all respects as in last \u00a7, that is, we must reduce the fractions involving these quantities to a common denominator, which will be the same as the denominator of the proposed fraction; then we must add the numerators, and put the coefficient of each power of \\( x \\) in the sum equal to the coefficient of the same power in the numerator of the proposed fraction. Thus we shall have as many equations as indeterminate quantities, and by resolving these equations, the values of these quantities will be found.\n\nHaving thus determined all the quantities \\( P, Q, R, \\ldots, Y \\), which enter into the fraction\n\n\\[ \\frac{(P_{x^{p-1}}+Q_{x^{p-2}}+\\ldots+Y)x}{(x+a)^p} \\]\n\nits fluent may be found as shown in \u00a7 109. But we may also assume it equal to\n\n\\[ \\frac{Mx}{(x+a)^p} + \\frac{M'x}{(x+a)^{p-1}} + \\frac{M''x}{(x+a)^{p-2}} \\ldots + \\frac{M''''x}{x+a} \\]\n\nand, it is easy to see, that by reducing these fractions to\na common denominator and adding them, the numerator of their sum will have the same form as that of the fraction whose fluent we are seeking; so that the values of the indeterminate quantities $M$, $M'$, &c. will be found by putting the coefficients of the same power of $x$ in both numerators equal to each other. To find the fluent of\n\n$$\\frac{M \\dot{x}}{(x+a)^p}$$\n\nwe may assume $x+a=z$, then $\\dot{x}=\\dot{z}$, and\n\n$$\\int \\frac{M \\dot{x}}{(x+a)^p} = \\int \\frac{M \\dot{z}}{z^p} = M \\frac{1}{1-p}.$$ \n\nIn like manner\n\n$$\\int \\frac{M' \\dot{x}}{(x+a)^{p-1}} = \\frac{M'}{(2-p)(x+a)^{p-2}}$$\n\nand so on, all the fluents being algebraic, except the last $\\int \\frac{M'' \\dot{x}}{x+a}$ which is $M''(x+a)$, a logarithmic function.\n\n113. In resolving the equation\n\n$$x^n + A'x^{n-1} + B'x^{n-2} + \\ldots + T = 0,$$\n\nit may happen that some of its roots $a, a', a''$, &c. are imaginary quantities, and then some of the simple factors $x+a, x+a', x+a''$, &c. will be imaginary. These factors always occur in pairs (ALGEBRA, \u00a7 179.) and have this form\n\n$$x+a+\\beta \\sqrt{-1}, \\quad x+a-\\beta \\sqrt{-1},$$\n\nso that their product\n\n$$x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2$$\n\nis a real factor of the second degree. As every corresponding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of imaginary simple factors may be united in this manner into a real factor of the second degree, if these factors are all unequal, we may avoid introducing imaginary quantities into the fluent of the proposed fraction by proceeding thus. Let $x+a+\\beta \\sqrt{-1}$ and $x+a-\\beta \\sqrt{-1}$ denote two corresponding imaginary simple factors of the denominator. Instead of the two simple fractions\n\n$$\\frac{N \\dot{x}}{x+a+\\beta \\sqrt{-1}}, \\quad \\frac{N' \\dot{x}}{x+a-\\beta \\sqrt{-1}},$$\n\nwhich would have been assumed if the factors had been real, assume a single fraction\n\n$$\\frac{(Kx+L) \\dot{x}}{x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2}$$\n\nthe denominator of which is a real function of $x$ of the second degree, viz. that which is the product of the two imaginary factors. Here $K$ and $L$ denote two constant but indeterminate coefficients, the values of which, as\n\nVOL. VIII. Part II.\n\nalso those of the other indeterminate coefficients are to be found as before.\n\nIf the denominator of the proposed fraction have several equal factors of the second degree resulting from its imaginary simple factors, so that the product of those equal factors is\n\n$$(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2)^q;$$\n\nthen, corresponding to this product, we must, among the fractions having indeterminate coefficients, assume one of this form\n\n$$\\frac{(Q'x^{2q-1} + R'x^{2q-2} + \\ldots + Y') \\dot{x}}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2)^q},$$\n\nwhere $Q', R', \\ldots Y'$ denote constant and indeterminate coefficients, the values of which will be found in all respects as those of the others.\n\nWe are now to find the fluents of these two fluxional expressions, beginning with the first, viz.\n\n$$\\frac{(Kx+L) \\dot{x}}{x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{(Kx+L) \\dot{x}}{(x+a)^2 + \\beta^2}.$$\n\nPut $x+a=z$, then it becomes\n\n$$\\frac{(Kz+L-Ka) \\dot{z}}{z^2 + \\beta^2};$$\n\nand this again, by putting $L-Ka=M$, is resolved into these two fluions\n\n$$\\frac{Kz \\dot{z}}{z^2 + \\beta^2} + \\frac{M \\dot{z}}{z^2 + \\beta^2}.$$\n\nWe can immediately find the fluent of the first of these, by putting $z^2 + \\beta^2=v$, for then $z \\dot{z} = \\frac{\\dot{v}}{2}$, and\n\n$$\\int \\frac{Kz \\dot{z}}{z^2 + \\beta^2} = \\frac{K}{2} \\int \\frac{\\dot{v}}{v} = K \\ln v, (\\S 103.),$$\n\n$$= K \\ln (z^2 + \\beta^2).$$\n\nWith respect to the other fluxion, if we put $z=\\beta y$, we have\n\n$$\\frac{M \\dot{z}}{z^2 + \\beta^2} = \\frac{M \\dot{y}}{1+y^2},$$\n\nbut we have seen ($\\S 60.$) that $\\frac{\\dot{y}}{1+y^2}$ is the fluxion of an arch of which the tangent is $y$, therefore\n\n$$\\int \\frac{M \\dot{y}}{1+y^2} = \\frac{M}{\\beta} \\arctan \\left(\\frac{y}{\\beta}\\right) + \\text{const.}$$\n\nIt is proper to remark that if $\\frac{z}{\\beta}$ be the tangent of an arch, then the sine of that arch is $\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{(z^2 + \\beta^2)}}$, and its cosine is $\\frac{\\beta}{\\sqrt{(z^2 + \\beta^2)}}$, thus we may express the fluent under\nunder different forms, by introducing the fine or cofine of the arch instead of its tangent.\n\nIf instead of \\( x \\) we substitute in these two fluents \\( x + a \\), we find that the fluent of \\( \\frac{(Kx + L)x}{x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2} \\) is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L - Kx}{b} \\arctan \\left( \\tan \\frac{x}{b} \\right) + \\text{const}.\n\\]\n\n114. To find the fluent of the expression\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(Qx^{2q-1} + R'x^{2q-2} + \\cdots + Y')x}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2)^q},\n\\]\n\nwe first transform it to\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(Kx + L)x}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2)^q} + \\frac{(K'x + L')x}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2)^{q-1}} + \\cdots + \\frac{(K''x + L''x)}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2)^3},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( K, L, K', L' \\), &c. denote indeterminate but constant coefficients, which may be determined by reducing these fractions to a common denominator, and proceeding as in the two preceding \u00a7\u00a7. Then the whole difficulty is reduced to the finding of the fluxion of the expression\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(Kx + L)x}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2)^q} = \\frac{(Kx + L)x}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2)^q},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( q \\) denotes some integer number. To simplify this expression put \\( x + a = z \\), and \\( L - K = M \\), then it becomes \\( \\frac{(Kz + M)z}{(z^2 + b^2)^q} \\), which we shall now show may be reduced to \\( \\int \\frac{H'z}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-1}} \\). To effect this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> we decompose its fluent into two parts\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{Kz}{(z^2 + b^2)^q} + \\int \\frac{Mz}{(z^2 + b^2)^q}.\n\\]\n\nThe fluent of the first part may be immediately found by putting \\( z^2 + b^2 = v \\); for then \\( z = \\frac{\\sqrt{v}}{2} \\) and\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{Kz}{(z^2 + b^2)^q} = \\int \\frac{Kv}{2v^q} = \\frac{K}{2(1-q)}.\n\\]\n\nLet us now suppose that the fluent of the second part \\( \\frac{Mz}{(z^2 + b^2)^q} \\) is equal to the sum of the algebraic function\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Gz}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-1}}, \\quad \\text{and another function, which is the fluent of } \\frac{H'z}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-1}}, \\text{ that is, let us assume}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{Mz}{(z^2 + b^2)^q} = \\frac{Gz}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-1}} + \\int \\frac{H'z}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-1}},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( G \\) and \\( H \\) are constant but indeterminate coefficients. To determine these let the fluxion of each side of this equation be taken (observing that the fluxion of a quantity having the sign \\( \\int \\) prefixed to it is the same quantity only without that sign); thus we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Mz}{(z^2 + b^2)^q} = \\frac{Gz}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-1}} - \\frac{2(q-1)Gz^2z}{(z^2 + b^2)^q} + \\frac{H'z}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-1}},\n\\]\n\nand from this equation, by rejecting what is common to each term, we find\n\n\\[\nM = G(z^2 + b^2) - 2(q-1)Gz^2 + H(z^2 + b^2),\n\\]\n\nand hence\n\n\\[\nM = Gz^2 + Hb^2 + (G - 2(q-1)G + H)z^2;\n\\]\n\nTherefore by comparing together like terms we find\n\n\\[\nM = Gz^2 + Hb^2, \\quad G - 2(q-1)G + H = 0;\n\\]\n\nand from these equations we get\n\n\\[\nG = \\frac{M}{(2q-2)b^2}, \\quad H = \\frac{(2q-3)M}{(2q-2)b^2}.\n\\]\n\nLet these values of \\( G \\) and \\( H \\) be now substituted in our assumed equation, and it becomes\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{Mz}{(z^2 + b^2)^q} = \\frac{M}{(2q-2)b^2} \\frac{z}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-1}} + \\frac{M(2q-3)}{(2q-2)b^2} \\int \\frac{z}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-1}}.\n\\]\n\nThus we have reduced the determination of the fluent of \\( \\frac{Mz}{(z^2 + b^2)^q} \\) to that of \\( \\frac{z}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-1}} \\), and by proceeding in the same manner with this last fluxion, its fluent may be made to depend on that of \\( \\frac{z}{(z^2 + b^2)^{q-2}} \\); but this will be more readily effected by simply substituting \\( q-1 \\) instead of \\( q \\), and supposing \\( M = 1 \\) in the preceding equation.\n\nThus\nThus we shall obtain\n\n\\[ \\int \\frac{z}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-1}} = \\frac{1}{(2q-4)\\beta^3} \\left( \\frac{x}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-2}} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ + \\frac{(2q-5)}{(2q-4)\\beta^3} \\int \\frac{z}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-2}} \\]\n\nSubstituting now this value of \\( \\int \\frac{z}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-1}} \\) in the former equation, we have \\( \\int \\frac{M}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^q} \\) equal to\n\n\\[ \\frac{M}{(2q-2)\\beta^3} \\left( \\frac{x}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-1}} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ - \\frac{(2q-3)M}{(2q-2)(2q-4)\\beta^4} \\left( \\frac{x}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-2}} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ + \\frac{(2q-3)(2q-5)M}{(2q-2)(2q-4)\\beta^4} \\int \\frac{z}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-2}} \\]\n\nIt is easy to see, that like as we obtained an expression for the fluent of \\( \\frac{z}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-1}} \\) by substituting \\( q-1 \\) for \\( q \\), and supposing \\( M=1 \\), in the equation preceding the last; so by substituting \\( q-2 \\) for \\( q \\), we shall obtain an expression for the fluent of \\( \\frac{z}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-2}} \\), which expression will consist of two terms, one an algebraic function of \\( x \\), and the other \\( \\int \\frac{z}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-3}} \\) multiplied by a constant and given coefficient. This value of \\( \\frac{z}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-2}} \\) when substituted in the last equation will produce an expression for \\( \\int \\frac{M}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^q} \\) consisting of algebraic quantities and \\( \\int \\frac{z}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^{q-3}} \\). By continuing this process it is evident that we shall at last have \\( \\int \\frac{M}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^q} \\) expressed by a series of algebraic quantities, and \\( \\int \\frac{z}{x^2 + \\beta^2} \\), and here we must stop, for if we repeat the process with a view to make the fluent depend on \\( \\int \\frac{z}{(x^2 + \\beta^2)^q} \\), that is on \\( \\int z \\), or \\( z \\), we shall find that the coefficient of this quantity becomes infinite. As to the fluent of \\( \\frac{z}{x^2 + \\beta^2} \\) we have exhibited the expression for it in last \u00a7.\n\nIn comparing together the results which have been obtained in the preceding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>, it must appear that when a fluxion is expressed by a rational fraction, if we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> the resolution of equations, the fluent may always be assigned either algebraically, or by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> of a circle or logarithms; and that to prepare it for a solution, we must decompose the fraction into others whose denominators may be either binomial or trinomial quantities. This decomposition may always be effected by the method of indeterminate coefficients. There are, however, several analytical artifices by which the labour of calculation may be greatly shortened. These we now proceed to explain.\n\n115. Let us recur to the fraction \\( \\frac{U}{V} \\) and suppose that \\( x+a \\) is one of the unequal factors of the denominator \\( V \\), so that we have \\( V=(x+a)Q \\); let us now put \\( \\frac{U}{V} = \\frac{A}{x+a} + \\frac{P}{Q} \\), \\( A \\) being supposed a constant quantity, and \\( P \\) an indeterminate function of \\( x \\), but such as not to be divisible by \\( x+a \\). Then we have \\( U=AQ+P(x+a) \\), and hence \\( P=\\frac{U-AQ}{x+a} \\). As \\( P \\) is an integer function with respect to \\( x \\), it follows from this equation that \\( U-AQ \\), which is also a rational and integer function of \\( x \\), is divisible by \\( x+a \\), and consequently has \\( x+a \\) for a factor; therefore, the function \\( U-AQ \\) will vanish when we substitute \\(-a\\) in it instead of \\( x \\), seeing that \\(-a\\) is the value of \\( x \\) that makes the factor \\( x+a=0 \\). Let us denote by \\( u \\) and \\( q \\), what \\( U \\) and \\( Q \\) become by this substitution, which however will not affect the indeterminate quantity \\( A \\), because it is independent of \\( x \\). We have therefore \\( u-Aq=0 \\), and consequently \\( A=\\frac{u}{q} \\).\n\nThis value of \\( A \\) requires that we should know the function \\( Q \\) given by the equation \\( V=(x+a)Q \\), and we may always find it by dividing \\( V \\) by \\( a+x \\). The direct method of fluxions affords also a very simple method of determining it. For by taking the fluxion of the above equation we have\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{V}}{x}=Q+(x+a)\\frac{\\dot{Q}}{x} \\]\n\nif in this result we make \\( x+a=0 \\), or \\( x=-a \\), and denote by \\( v \\) what \\( \\frac{\\dot{V}}{x} \\) becomes by that substitution, we shall have \\( v=q \\), and consequently \\( A=\\frac{u}{v} \\).\n\nThe expression \\( A=\\frac{u}{q} \\) has always a finite value, for the numerator and denominator can never become \\( =0 \\), because we suppose the fraction \\( \\frac{U}{V} \\) reduced to its lowest terms, and consequently, that the numerator \\( U \\) has not for a factor \\( x+a \\), which is a factor of the denominator, but which being contained in it only once does not enter into \\( Q \\).\n\n116. Let us now consider how the numerators of the fractions, into which the proposed fraction \\( \\frac{U}{V} \\) is to be decomposed, are to be found in the case of the denominator.\nThe direct method of fluxions facilitates greatly the preceding operations. For the numerator of \\( P \\) being divisible by \\((x+a)^n\\) is necessarily of this form \\( X(x+a)^n \\), \\( X \\) being an integer function of \\( x \\), but which does not contain the factor \\( x+a \\). Now agreeably to what has been shown in \u00a7 88, the successive fluxions of this numerator, as far as the \\( n-1 \\) order inclusive, vanish when \\( x+a \\) is supposed \\( =0 \\). By giving to the numerator the following form\n\n\\[\nQ \\left( \\frac{U}{Q} - A - B(x+a) - C(x+a)^2 \\ldots \\right)\n\\]\n\nand observing that the function \\( Q \\) does not contain the factor \\( x+a \\), it is manifest that it is only the part of this expression between the parentheses which ought to be divisible by \\((x+a)^n\\). Let us put \\( \\frac{U}{Q} = Z \\), then the successive fluxions of that part are\n\n\\[\nZ - Bx - 2C(x+a)x^2 - 3D(x+a)^3x^3 \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\\[\nZ - 2C(x+a)x^2 - 3D(x+a)^3x^3 \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\\[\nZ - 2 \\cdot 3D(x+a)^3x^3 \\ldots\n\\]\n\n&c.\n\nand these results brought all to vanish when we put \\( x+a=0 \\). Thus we have\n\n\\[\nZ - A = 0, \\quad A = \\frac{u}{q},\n\\]\n\n\\[\nZ - Bx = 0, \\quad B = \\frac{Z}{x},\n\\]\n\n\\[\nZ - 2C(x+a)x^2 = 0, \\quad C = \\frac{Z}{2x^2},\n\\]\n\n\\[\nZ - 2 \\cdot 3D(x+a)^3x^3 = 0, \\quad D = \\frac{Z}{2 \\cdot 3x^3},\n\\]\n\n&c. &c.\n\nobserving that in each of these functions \\( \\frac{Z}{x}, \\frac{Z}{2x^2}, \\ldots \\) we must substitute \\(-a\\) instead of \\( x \\).\n\nThe most simple way to find the value of \\( Q \\) in this case is to divide \\( V \\) by \\((x+a)^n\\), but we may also find it by the direct method of fluxions, as in the preceding \u00a7; for, since \\( V = Q(x+a)^n \\), if we take the fluxion of each side of this equation \\( n \\) times, and then make \\( x+a=c \\), we shall find, \u00a7 88, the \\( n \\)th fluxion of \\( V \\) equal to \\( 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots n \\cdot Q \\cdot x^n \\), and consequently\n\n\\[\nQ = \\frac{n \\text{th flux. of } V}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdots n \\cdot x^n}.\n\\]\n\n117. Let us now consider how we are to find the numerator of the fraction which forms a part of \\( \\frac{U}{V} \\) when it has this form\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A(x+B)}{x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2}.\n\\]\n\nAssume\nAssume\n\n\\[ \\frac{U}{V} = \\frac{Ax + B}{x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2} + \\frac{P}{Q}; \\]\n\nthen, reducing the latter part of this equation to a common denominator, we find\n\n\\[ U = Q(Ax + B) + P(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2). \\]\n\nHence we deduce\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{U - Q(Ax + B)}{x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2}. \\]\n\nAs \\( P \\) is supposed to be an integer function with respect to \\( x \\), it follows that \\( U - Q(Ax + B) \\) is divisible by \\( x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2 \\); therefore, the former of these quantities must contain among its factors those of the latter, and the quantities, which, being substituted for \\( x \\), cause the latter to vanish, must also make the former vanish. But the factors of \\( x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2 \\) are \\( x + a + \\beta \\sqrt{-1} \\), and \\( x + a - \\beta \\sqrt{-1} \\), and these, being put each equal to zero, give us \\( x = -(a + \\beta \\sqrt{-1}) \\), and \\( x = -(a - \\beta \\sqrt{-1}) \\); therefore, each of these values of \\( x \\) being substituted in \\( U - Q(Ax + B) \\) ought to make that quantity vanish. Let us denote by \\( u = u' \\sqrt{-1} \\), and by \\( q = q' \\sqrt{-1} \\) what \\( U \\) and \\( Q \\) respectively become when \\( -(a + \\beta \\sqrt{-1}) \\) is substituted in each instead of \\( x \\), then, after this transformation, we have\n\n\\[ \\frac{u - u'}{\\sqrt{-1}} \\left\\{ -A(a + \\beta \\sqrt{-1}) + B \\right\\} = 0. \\]\n\nThis equation is twofold, because of the sign \\( \\pm \\) with which several of its terms are affected, and it is equivalent to those which would be formed by putting the real part equal to zero, and the imaginary part equal to zero; from this consideration we have\n\n\\[ u + q = A - q' \\beta A - q B = 0, \\]\n\\[ u' + q' \\beta A + q' \\beta A - q' B = 0, \\]\n\ntwo equations which give us the values of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nThe function \\( Q \\) may be found as in \u00a7 115. For, if we take the fluxions of each side of the equation\n\n\\[ Q(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2) = V, \\]\n\nand afterwards make\n\n\\[ x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2 = 0, \\]\n\nwe find \\( Q(2x + 2a) = \\dot{V} \\) and hence\n\n\\[ Q = \\frac{\\dot{V}}{2x + 2a}. \\]\n\nLet the two values of \\( x \\), to wit \\( -(a + \\beta \\sqrt{-1}) \\), be substituted instead of \\( x \\) in this equation, then, putting \\( v = v' \\sqrt{-1} \\) to denote what the expression becomes by that substitution, and writing \\( q = q' \\sqrt{-1} \\) instead of \\( Q \\), we have\n\n\\[ q = q' \\sqrt{-1} = \\frac{v - v'}{\\sqrt{-1}}, \\]\n\nwhich, by multiplying the terms of the fraction on the latter side of the equation by \\( \\sqrt{-1} \\), becomes\n\n\\[ q = q' \\sqrt{-1} = \\frac{v - v'}{\\sqrt{-1}}. \\]\n\nHence, by putting the real part of each side of this equation equal to each other, and also the imaginary parts equal to each other, we find\n\n\\[ q = -\\frac{v'}{\\beta}, \\quad q' = \\frac{v}{\\beta}. \\]\n\n118. If the factor \\( x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2 \\) is found several times in the denominator of \\( V \\), so that\n\n\\[ V = Q(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2)^n, \\]\n\nthen, \u00a7 113, we assume in this case\n\n\\[ \\frac{U}{V} \\text{ equal to } \\frac{Ax + B}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2)^n} + \\frac{A'x + B'}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2)^n-1} + \\cdots + \\frac{P}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2)^n}. \\]\n\nReducing this expression to a common denominator, and ordering the equation as to bring \\( P \\) to stand alone on one side, we find \\( P \\) equal to\n\n\\[ U - Q \\left\\{ \\frac{Ax + B + (A'x + B')(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2)}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2)^n} + \\cdots \\right\\}. \\]\n\nBy reasoning in this as in the preceding case, it may be concluded that the numerator of this expression ought to vanish when \\( -(a + \\beta \\sqrt{-1}) \\) is substituted in it instead of \\( x \\); therefore, putting \\( u = u' \\sqrt{-1} \\), and \\( q = q' \\sqrt{-1} \\) to denote the same things as before, we deduce from that substitution\n\n\\[ \\frac{u - u'}{\\sqrt{-1}} \\left\\{ -A(a + \\beta \\sqrt{-1}) + B \\right\\} = 0. \\]\n\nThe very same equation for the determination of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), as we have already found in last \u00a7.\n\nHaving found the values of these quantities, they may be substituted in the numerator of \\( P \\), and the terms \\( U - Q(Ax + B) \\) becoming divisible by \\( x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2 \\), the whole expression becomes divisible by the same quantity. Calling therefore \\( U' \\) the quotient arising from the division of \\( U - Q(Ax + B) \\) by \\( x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2 \\), we have \\( P \\) equal to\n\n\\[ U' - Q \\left\\{ \\frac{Ax + B + (A'x + B')(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2)}{(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2)^n} \\right\\}. \\]\n\nIf in this numerator we substitute instead of \\( x \\) its values deduced from the equation \\( x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2 = 0 \\), and put the result \\( = 0 \\), we may determine \\( A' \\) and \\( B' \\) in the very same way that we have already determined \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), and by proceeding in this manner we shall find the remaining coefficients \\( A'' \\), \\( B'' \\), &c.\n\nThis case is quite analogous to that which has been already treated in \u00a7 116, and the direct method of fluxions applies to it in the same manner as to the other. For since \\( Q \\) does not contain the factor \\( x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + \\beta^2 \\), if the numerator of \\( P \\) be divided by the function \\( Q \\), the result, which may be denoted by \\( r \\), ought to be of this form\nform \\( r = X(x^3 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2) \\) and consequently ought to vanish, as well as all its fluxions, from the first order to the \\( n-1 \\) order, inclusively, when \\( x^3 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2 = 0 \\); this being the case, we have these equations\n\n\\[ r = c, \\quad r' = 0, \\quad r'' = 0, \\ldots \\]\n\nand so on to the \\( n-1 \\) fluxion of \\( r \\), which ought also to be \\( = 0 \\); each of these equations becomes twofold when we substitute instead of \\( x \\), the values of which it is susceptible in consequence of the equation \\( x^3 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2 = 0 \\). By putting the real and the imaginary parts separately \\( = 0 \\), we shall obtain as many equations as are sufficient to determine \\( A, B, A', B' \\), &c.\n\nIt may also be remarked, that from the equation\n\n\\[ V = Q(x^3 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2) \\]\n\nwe find \\( Q \\) equal to the quotient arising from the division of the \\( n \\)th fluxion of \\( V \\) by the \\( n \\)th fluxion of \\( x^3 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2 \\), observing to assume\n\n\\[ x^3 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2 = 0. \\]\n\n119. We shall now give some applications of what has been said relative to the fluents of rational fractions. Suppose the fraction to be\n\n\\[ \\frac{x^8 + x^7 - x^4 - x}{x^8 + x^7 - x^4 - x} ; \\]\n\nThe factors of its denominator are easily found, for it may be put under this form\n\n\\[ x^3(x^5 + x^4 - x - 1) = x^3(x + 1)(x^4 - 1), \\]\n\nthe factor \\( x^4 - 1 \\) may be decomposed into \\( x^2 - 1 \\) and \\( x^2 + 1 \\), or \\( x - 1, x + 1, \\) and \\( x^2 + 1 \\), thus we have the denominator equal to\n\n\\[ x^3(x - 1)(x + 1)^2(x^2 + 1) \\]\n\ntherefore (\\$ 111, \u00a7 112, and \u00a7 113.) the proposed fraction is to be decomposed as follows\n\n\\[ \\frac{A}{x - 1} + \\frac{B}{(x + 1)^2} + \\frac{C}{x + 1} + \\frac{D}{x^2} + \\frac{E}{x^3} + \\frac{F}{x^4} + \\frac{(Gx + H)}{x^5} \\]\n\nBy reducing these fractions to a common denominator, and comparing the numerator of their sum with that of the proposed fraction, we might determine the unknown quantities \\( A, B, C, \\) &c. we shall, however, rather employ the methods that have just been explained.\n\nBy comparing this particular example\n\n\\[ \\frac{x^8 + x^7 - x^4 - x^3}{x^8 + x^7 - x^4 - x^3} \\]\n\nwith the general expression \\( \\frac{U}{V} \\), it appears that \\( U = 1 \\), and \\( V = x^8 + x^7 - x^4 - x^3 \\). First let us investigate the numerator of the fraction \\( \\frac{A}{x - 1} \\), and for this purpose we employ the formula \\( A = \\frac{u}{v} \\) (\\$ 115.). As we have \\( U = 1 \\), it is evident that \\( u = 1 \\); and since \\( V = x^8 + x^7 - x^4 - x^3 \\)\n\n\\[ -x^4 - x^3, \\text{ therefore } \\frac{V}{x} = 8x^7 + 7x^6 - 4x^3 - 3x^4. \\]\n\nIf in this expression we substitute \\( -1 \\) instead of \\( x \\) (viz. the value of \\( x \\) deduced from the equation \\( x - 1 = 0 \\)) we find the result to be 8, therefore \\( v = 8 \\). So that\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{u}{v} = \\frac{1}{8}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{A}{x - 1} = \\frac{1}{8}. \\]\n\nLet us next investigate the values of \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) in the fractions \\( \\frac{B}{(x + 1)^2} \\) and \\( \\frac{C}{x + 1} \\), by means of the rule of \u00a7 116, and that we may make the symbols expressing the quantity under consideration agree with those employed in that formula, let us <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> the letters \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), so that we are to consider\n\n\\[ \\frac{A}{(x + 1)^2} + \\frac{B}{x + 1}. \\]\n\nIn the first place we have\n\n\\[ Q = \\frac{x^8 + x^7 - x^4 - x^3}{(x + 1)^2} = x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3; \\]\n\nPut \\( x + 1 = 0 \\), then \\( x = -1 \\); substituting now this value of \\( x \\) in the value of \\( Q \\), the result is \\( 4 = 9 \\), therefore \\( A = \\frac{u}{q} = \\frac{1}{4} \\). Let this value of \\( A \\) be substituted for \\( A \\) in the expression for \\( U' \\) in the \u00a7 above cited, and we have\n\n\\[ U' = \\frac{U - AQ}{x + 1} = \\frac{4 - x^6 + x^5 - x^4 + x^3}{4(x + 1)} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{-x^8 + 2x^7 - 3x^6 + 4x^5 - 4x^4 + 4}{4} \\]\n\nHence putting \\( -1 \\) instead of \\( x \\) in the expression for \\( U' \\), we have \\( u' = \\frac{9}{2} \\) and \\( B = \\frac{9}{8} \\). Thus the two fractions under consideration are found to be \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(x + 1)^2} \\) and \\( \\frac{9}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x + 1} \\). We might have deduced the value of \\( B \\) from the formula \\( B = \\frac{Z}{x} \\), \u00a7 116, where \\( Z \\) is put for \\( \\frac{U}{Q} \\) for we have\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{U}{Q} = \\frac{x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3}{x^8 + x^7 - x^4 - x^3} \\]\n\nand \\( \\frac{Z}{x} = \\frac{6x^8 - 5x^7 + 4x^6 - 3x^5}{(x^8 + x^7 - x^4 - x^3)^2} \\).\n\nIf in this expression we substitute \\( -1 \\) instead of \\( x \\), it becomes \\( \\frac{18}{16} = \\frac{9}{8} \\), the same value for \\( B \\) as before.\n\nLet us now consider the fractions \\( \\frac{D}{x^2} + \\frac{E}{x^3} + \\frac{F}{x^4} \\), or exchanging the symbols \\( D, E, F \\) for \\( A, B, C \\),\n\n\\[ \\frac{A}{x^2} + \\frac{B}{x^3} + \\frac{C}{x^4}. \\]\n\nThe numerators \\( A, B, C \\) may all be found from these formulas of \u00a7 116.\nThe union of all the algebraic terms produces the fraction \\(\\frac{2-2x-5x^2}{4x^2(1+x)}\\), and that of the logarithmic quantities gives\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{8}l.(x-1) + \\frac{1}{8}l.(x+1) + l.(x+1)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{8}l.\\left(\\frac{x^2-1}{x^2+1}\\right) + l.\\left(\\frac{x+1}{x}\\right).\n\\]\n\nWe have therefore upon the whole \\(f(x^6+x^7-x^4-x^3)\\) equal to\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2-2x-5x^2}{4x^2(1+x)} + \\frac{1}{8}l.\\left(\\frac{x^2-1}{x^2+1}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n+ l.\\left(\\frac{x+1}{x}\\right) - \\frac{1}{4} \\text{arc (tan. } x) + \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\n120. When a fluxion is a rational fraction having either of these forms\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^m}{x^n+a^n}, \\quad \\frac{x^m}{x^n+2\\rho a^n x^n+a^n},\n\\]\n\nwe can always, by the application of a particular theorem in analysis, resolve its denominator into real factors of the first and second degrees. The theorem to which we allude is this. Let \\(n\\) be any positive integer, and let \\(z\\) denote any arch of a circle, of which the radius is unity, then\n\n\\[\n(\\text{cof. } z = \\sqrt{-1} \\text{ fin. } z)^n = \\text{cof. } n z = \\sqrt{-1} \\text{ fin. } n z.\n\\]\n\nWe proceed to prove this theorem. Because\n\n\\[\n(\\text{cof. } z + \\sqrt{-1} \\text{ fin. } z)(\\text{cof. } z - \\sqrt{-1} \\text{ fin. } z)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\text{cof. } z + \\text{fin. } z = 1.\n\\]\n\nIf we put \\(\\text{cof. } z = \\sqrt{-1} \\text{ fin. } z = v\\),\n\nThen \\(\\text{cof. } z = \\sqrt{-1} \\text{ fin. } z = \\frac{1}{v}\\);\n\nTherefore taking the sum of these two equations,\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ cof. } z = v + \\frac{1}{v}.\n\\]\n\nNow by the arithmetic of lines (Algebra, \u00a7 358.)\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ cof. } 2 z = 2 (\\text{cof. } z \\times \\text{cof. } z - 1),\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ cof. } 3 z = 2 (\\text{cof. } z \\times \\text{cof. } 2 z - \\text{cof. } z),\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ cof. } 4 z = 2 (\\text{cof. } z \\times \\text{cof. } 3 z - \\text{cof. } 2 z),\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ cof. } 5 z = 2 (\\text{cof. } z \\times \\text{cof. } 4 z - \\text{cof. } 3 z).\n\\]\n\n&c.\n\nTherefore, substituting in the first of these equations \\(v + \\frac{1}{v}\\) instead of \\(2 \\text{ cof. } z\\), we have\n\\[2 \\text{ cof. } 2 z = (v + \\frac{1}{v})(v + \\frac{1}{v}) - 2\\]\n\n\\[= v^2 + \\frac{1}{v^2}.\\]\n\nIn like manner, substituting in the second equation, \\(v + \\frac{1}{v}\\) instead of \\(2 \\text{ cof. } z\\), and \\(v^2 + \\frac{1}{v^2}\\) instead of \\(2 \\text{ cof. } 2 z\\), we have\n\n\\[2 \\text{ cof. } 3 z = (v + \\frac{1}{v})(v^2 + \\frac{1}{v^2}) - (v + \\frac{1}{v})\\]\n\n\\[= v^3 + \\frac{1}{v^3}.\\]\n\nProceeding in the same way with the third and following equations, we find\n\n\\[2 \\text{ cof. } 4 z = v^4 + \\frac{1}{v^4},\\]\n\n\\[2 \\text{ cof. } 5 z = v^5 + \\frac{1}{v^5};\\]\n\nso that we may conclude in general that\n\n\\[2 \\text{ cof. } n z = v^n + \\frac{1}{v^n};\\]\n\nHence we have this quadratic equation\n\n\\[v^n - 2 \\text{ cof. } n z \\times v^n + 1 = 0,\\]\n\nfrom which, by completing the square, we find\n\n\\[v^n = \\text{ cof. } n z \\pm \\sqrt{(\\text{ cof. } n z - 1)};\\]\n\ntherefore, by substituting for \\(v\\) the quantity it was put to represent, and observing that \\(\\sqrt{(\\text{ cof. } n z - 1)} = \\sqrt{(-\\sin^2 n z)} = \\sqrt{-1} \\sin n z\\), we have\n\n\\[(\\text{ cof. } z \\pm \\sqrt{-1} \\sin n z)^n = \\text{ cof. } n z \\pm \\sqrt{-1} \\sin n z,\\]\n\nas was to be proved.\n\n121.

But besides, that it may contain algebraic terms only, it is necessary that none of the divisors \\( n-m-1, 2n-m-1, 3n-m-1, \\) &c. become \\( = 0 \\); this circumstance will take place as often as \\( m+1 \\) is a multiple of \\( n \\), and in which case\n\nthe series \\( \\frac{x^m}{x^n - a^n} + \\text{&c.} \\) which is the development of the fluxion will contain a term of this form \\( \\frac{a^n}{x^n} \\), the fluent of which is \\( a^n \\cdot 1 \\cdot x \\).\n\nIf in this result we put \\( m = 0, n = 2, \\) and \\( a = 1 \\) we get\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{dx}{1+x^2} = \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{3x^3} - \\frac{1}{5x^5} + \\text{&c.} + \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\nBut although the expression \\( \\frac{x}{1+x^2} \\) is the fluxion of the arch having \\( x \\) for its tangent, we must not conclude that this series is the development of that arch, for \\( x \\) being supposed \\( = 0 \\), each of the terms of the series becomes infinite.\n\nThe consideration of the constant quantity added to the fluent will remove this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> difficulty, if we remark, that to know the true value of a series, it is always necessary to begin with the case in which it is convergent. Now the series\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{3x^3} - \\frac{1}{5x^5} + \\text{&c.}\n\\]\n\nconverges so much the faster as \\( x \\) is greater, and it vanishes when \\( x \\) is infinite; but in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> case the equation\n\n\\[\n\\arctan(x) = \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{3x^3} - \\frac{1}{5x^5} + \\text{&c.} + \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\nbecomes simply \\( \\arctan(x) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\text{const.} \\) where \\( \\pi \\) denotes half the circumference of the circle; therefore, substituting this value of the constant quantity, we have\n\n\\[\n\\arctan(x) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{3x^3} - \\frac{1}{5x^5} + \\text{&c.}\n\\]\n\nWe may easily find an expression for the fluent of the rational fraction \\( \\frac{Ux}{V} \\) (\\$ III.) by expanding the quantity \\( \\frac{U}{V} \\) into a series, but the result thus obtained is in general very complicated, and seldom convergent; besides, this manner of finding the fluent is hardly of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, since it may be expressed by means of arches of a circle and logarithms, both of which are readily obtained from the common trigonometrical tables.\n\n139. The fluent of \\( x^m - x \\cdot (a + bx^n)^{\\frac{p}{q}} \\) is easily obtained by first expanding the quantity \\( (a + bx^n)^{\\frac{p}{q}} \\) into a series by the binomial theorem, then multiplying each term of that series by \\( x^{m-1} \\cdot x \\), and taking the fluents of the results by \u00a7 101.

Let it be required to express by a series the fluent of \\( \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\). That we may develop the radical quantity \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\) we put it under this form\nInverse Method.\n\n\\[(1-x^2)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\] an expression which when expanded by the binomial theorem is\n\n\\[1 + \\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \\frac{1}{24}x^4 + \\frac{1}{240}x^6 + \\&c.\\]\n\ntherefore, multiplying each term of this series by \\(x\\) and taking the fluent, we get\n\n\\[\\int \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}} = x + \\frac{1}{2}x^3 + \\frac{1}{24}x^5 + \\frac{1}{240}x^7 + \\&c.\\]\n\nIf we suppose \\(x\\) to denote the sine of an arch, then \\(\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}\\) is its cosine, and \\(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}}\\) is the fluxion of the arch itself (\\$59.). Therefore the series which we have just found expresses the length of the arch of a circle, radius being unity, and the sine of the arch \\(x\\). If we suppose the series to express the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> left arch that corresponds to the sine \\(x\\), then, as when the sine of that arch \\(=0\\), the arch itself \\(=0\\), the series expressing the arch must vanish when \\(x=0\\), therefore we must suppress the constant quantity added to complete the fluent; or suppose it \\(=0\\). The same series has already been found by the direct method of fluxions in \u00a772.\n\nLet \\(x\\) denote the same as in \u00a7137, then, as the sine of 30 degrees, or of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) radians, we have, by substituting \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) instead of \\(x\\) in the preceding series, and multiplying both sides by 6,\n\n\\[=3 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{24} \\cdot \\frac{1}{24} \\cdot \\frac{1}{24} + \\&c.\\right)\\]\n\nby means of this series, which involves only rational numbers, we may compute (but with more labour), the value of \\(\\pi\\) as before.\n\nSuppose the fluxion to be \\(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(ax-x^2)}}\\), which may be otherwise expressed thus, \\(\\frac{x}{a} \\cdot \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(1-\\frac{x^2}{a})}}\\).

By resolving a fluxion into an infinite series, the object in view is to transform it into a series of other fluxions, each of which may have its fluent determined by known methods; but it is not always necessary that the terms of the series should be each simply a power of \\(x\\) multiplied by \\(x\\) and constant quantities.\n\nIf for example we have this fluxion\n\n\\[\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(1-e^2x^2)}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}}\\]\n\nin which \\(e\\) is supposed to denote a small constant quantity, we may expand \\(\\sqrt{(1-e^2x^2)}\\) or \\((1-e^2x^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) into a series, which will thus become\n\n\\[1 - \\frac{e^2x^2}{2} - \\frac{1}{24}e^4x^4 - \\frac{1}{240}e^6x^6 + \\&c.\\]\n\nand the fluxion \\(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(1-e^2x^2)}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}}\\) will be transformed to\n\n\\[\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}} \\left\\{1 - \\frac{e^2x^2}{2} - \\frac{1}{24}e^4x^4 - \\frac{1}{240}e^6x^6 + \\&c.\\right\\}\\]\n\nthe series will converge very fast when \\(e\\) is small, for that \\(\\sqrt{(1-e^2x^2)}\\) may be a real quantity, \\(e^2\\) must be less than 1. We must now multiply each term of the series by the common factor \\(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}}\\) and take the fluents, which being all contained in the general expression\n\n\\[\\int \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}}\\]\n\nwill be found by \u00a7133. Thus, putting \\(A\\) to denote an arch of which \\(x\\) is the sine, we have\n\n\\[\\int \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}} = \\]\n\n\\[A + \\frac{1}{2}e^2 \\left\\{1 - \\frac{e^2x^2}{2} - \\frac{1}{24}e^4x^4 - \\frac{1}{240}e^6x^6 + \\&c.\\right\\}\\]\n\nOf the Fluents of such Fluxions as involve Logarithmic and Exponential Functions.\n\n142. Let it be required to find the fluent of \\(x^m \\cdot \\log(x)\\), where \\(x\\) denotes the Napierian logarithm of \\(x\\). In this case, as well as in some following examples, we shall have recourse to the principle already employed in \u00a7139, namely, that if \\(v\\) and \\(z\\) denote any functions of a variable quantity \\(x\\), then\n\n\\[\\int x^m \\cdot \\log(x) = \\int v \\cdot z.\\]\n\nLet us therefore assume \\(x^m \\cdot \\log(x) = v\\), and \\(1 \\cdot x = z\\), then, (\\$101), \\(x^{m+1} = v\\), and (\\$57), \\(x = z\\), therefore, substituting\nPart II.\n\nInverting substituting these values of \\( v, z, \\dot{v}, \\dot{z} \\) in the formula it becomes\n\n\\[\n\\int x^m \\dot{x} (1, x) = \\frac{x^{m+1}}{m+1} - \\int \\frac{x^m \\dot{x}}{m+1},\n\\]\n\nor, since \\( \\int \\frac{x^m \\dot{x}}{m+1} = \\frac{x^{m+1}}{(m+1)^2} + \\text{const.} \\),\n\n\\[\n\\int x^m \\dot{x} (1, x) = x^{m+1} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{m+1} - \\frac{1}{(m+1)^2} \\right\\} + \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\nLet us next suppose that the proposed fluxion is \\( x^m \\dot{x} (1, x)^n \\).

The formula however will not apply when \\( m = -1 \\), because of the denominator \\( m+1 = -1 + 1 = 0 \\).\n\nBut in this case we have\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{x^n \\dot{x}}{x} (1, x)^n = \\frac{1}{n+1} (1, x)^{n+1} + \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\nIf \\( n \\) be negative or fractional the fluent of \\( x^m \\dot{x} (1, x)^n \\) can only be expressed by an infinite series.\n\n143. As an example of an exponential function, let it be required to find the fluent of \\( ax^n \\dot{x} \\). Here we may put \\( v \\) for \\( ax^n \\), and \\( z \\) for \\( ax^n \\), then we have \\( v = \\frac{ax^n}{n+1} \\), \u00a7101, and \\( z = (1, a) ax^n \\), (\\$56.) therefore, substituting these values of \\( v, z, \\dot{v}, \\dot{z} \\) in the formula \\( \\int z \\dot{v} = vz - \\int v \\dot{z} \\) we get\n\n\\[\n\\int ax^n \\dot{x} = \\frac{ax^{n+1}}{n+1} - \\int \\frac{(1, a) ax^n \\dot{x}}{n+1},\n\\]\n\ntherefore, substituting \\( n = -1 \\) everywhere instead of \\( n \\),\n\n\\[\n\\int ax^n \\dot{x} = \\frac{ax^n}{n} - \\int \\frac{(1, a) ax^n \\dot{x}}{n},\n\\]\n\nhence, bringing \\( \\int ax^n \\dot{x} \\) to stand alone one side of the equation\n\n\\[\n\\int ax^n \\dot{x} = \\frac{ax^n}{1, a} - \\frac{n}{1, a} \\int ax^n \\dot{x} - \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\nIf we suppose \\( n = 1 \\), then, observing that \\( \\int ax^n \\dot{x} = \\frac{ax^n}{1, a} \\) Inverse Method.\n\n(\\$56.), \\( \\int ax^n \\dot{x} = \\frac{ax^n}{1, a} - \\frac{ax^n}{(1, a)^2} + \\text{const.} \\)\n\nIf \\( n = 2 \\), then\n\n\\[\n\\int ax^n \\dot{x} = \\frac{ax^n}{1, a} - \\frac{2}{1, a} \\int ax^n \\dot{x}.\n\\]\n\nIn this expression we substitute the value of \\( \\int ax^n \\dot{x} \\) just found, thus it becomes\n\n\\[\n\\int ax^n \\dot{x} = ax^n \\left\\{ \\frac{x^n}{1, a} - \\frac{2x^n}{(1, a)^2} \\right\\} + \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\nProceeding in this way we may find the fluent when \\( n = 3 \\), or when \\( n = 4 \\), or in general, when \\( n \\) is any integer number whatever, the number of terms in the fluent being in this case always finite; it is not so however when \\( n \\) is either negative or fractional.\n\nOf the Fluents of such Fluxions as contain functions related to a circle.\n\n144. Let us suppose that \\( z \\) is an arch whose fine is \\( x \\), and that it is required to find the fluent of \\( z^n \\dot{x} \\). Put \\( z^n \\dot{x} = v \\), then\n\n\\[\n\\int z^n \\dot{x} = \\int z \\dot{v} = vz - \\int v \\dot{z};\n\\]\n\nbut since \\( v = z^n \\dot{x} \\), we have \\( v = \\frac{zn+1}{n+1} \\), \u00a7101, and since \\( z = \\text{fin. } x \\), we have \\( \\dot{z} = \\text{col. } x = \\sqrt{1-x^2} \\) (\\$59.), and therefore \\( \\dot{z} = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\); thus we have\n\n\\[\n\\int z^n \\dot{x} = \\frac{zn+1}{n+1} - \\frac{1}{n+1} \\int \\frac{zn+1}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}};\n\\]\n\nhence the determination of the proposed fluent is reduced to \\( \\int \\frac{zn+1}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\) which we have already considered in \u00a7133.

It appears from \u00a759, that \\( n \\) being put to denote any arch of a circle to radius unity, the fluxion of the fine of that arch is \\( n \\cdot \\text{col. } n \\cdot z \\); therefore on the contrary,\n\n\\[\n\\int \\dot{z} \\cdot \\text{col. } n \\cdot z = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\text{fin. } n \\cdot z + \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\nIn like manner from the formulas of \u00a759, and \u00a760, we find\n\n\\[\n\\int \\dot{z} \\cdot \\text{fin. } n \\cdot z = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\text{col. } n \\cdot z + \\text{const.}\n\\]\n\\[ \\int \\dot{z} \\sin n z = -\\frac{1}{n} \\cos n z + \\text{const}. \\]\n\n\\[ \\int \\dot{z} \\cot n z = \\frac{1}{n} \\tan n z + \\text{const}. \\]\n\n\\[ \\int \\dot{z} \\sec n z = \\frac{1}{n} \\cot n z + \\text{const}. \\]\n\n\\[ \\int \\dot{z} \\csc n z = \\frac{1}{n} \\sec n z + \\text{const}. \\]\n\n146.

II. Application of the Inverse Method of Fluxions to the Resolution of Problems.\n\nTo find the Areas of Curves.\n\n152. It has been shown in \u00a761, that if the abscissa of a curve be denoted by \\( x \\), the ordinate by \\( y \\), and the area\narea by \\( s \\), then \\( s = y \\cdot x \\). Therefore the general formula expressing the area of any curve will be\n\n\\[\ns = \\int y \\cdot x \\, dx\n\\]\n\nHence, to find the area of any curve, we must either find from the equation of the curve the value of \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\), or else the value of \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\), and \\( y \\), and either the one or the other of these being substituted into the above formula, and the fluent found by the methods already explained, we shall have a general expression for the curvilinear area as required.\n\n**Ex. 1.** Let it be required to find the area of any curve of the parabolic kind, of which, putting the abscissa \\( AB = x \\), and the ordinate \\( BP = y \\), the equation is\n\n\\[\ny^n = ax^m\n\\]\n\nThen we have \\( y = ax^{m/n} \\), and\n\n\\[\ns = \\int y \\cdot x \\, dx = \\int ax^{m/n} \\cdot x \\, dx\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{na}{m+n} x^{m+n} + C,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) denotes the constant quantity that may be required to complete the fluent. As in the present case, it is required to find the area of the portion of the curve next its vertex, so that when \\( x = 0 \\), therefore also \\( C = 0 \\), and the area is simply\n\n\\[\n\\frac{na}{m+n} x^{m+n}\n\\]\n\nIf it be required to find the area comprehended between two ordinates \\( PB, PB' \\), put \\( AB = d \\), then when \\( x = d \\), therefore the general expression\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{na}{m+n} x^{m+n} + C\n\\]\n\nbecomes in this case\n\n\\[\n\\frac{na}{m+n} d^{m+n} + C,\n\\]\n\nand consequently the area \\( BP \\cdot PB' \\), or \\( s \\), is equal to\n\n\\[\n\\frac{na}{m+n} \\left( x^{m+n} - d^{m+n} \\right)\n\\]\n\nWhen \\( n \\) is an even number, the expression for the area, viz. \\( \\frac{na}{m+n} x^{m+n} \\), may be considered as negative as well as positive, on account of the radical quantity \\( x^{m+n} \\), or \\( \\sqrt{x^{m+n}} \\), which has then a twofold value, it may therefore have the sign \\( \\pm \\) prefixed to it; but in this case the same abscissa \\( AB \\) belongs to two branches of the curve \\( AP \\) and \\( AP' \\) as in fig. 19. N\u00b0 1, therefore the two values of the expression \\( \\frac{na}{m+n} x^{m+n} \\) may be considered as indicating the two areas \\( \\Delta PB, \\Delta PB' \\).\n\nOn each side of the axis, corresponding the one to the positive, and the other to the negative ordinates.\n\nWhen the exponents \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are both odd numbers,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m+n}{m+n}\n\\]\n\nthe quantity \\( x^{m+n} \\) has only one sign and remains always positive whatever be the sign of \\( x \\), but in this case one of the two branches of the curve has its abscissas and its ordinates negative at the same time (as in fig. 19. N\u00b0 2.) it follows therefore that the areas corresponding to the negative abscissas and ordinates ought to be regarded as positive.\n\nIf \\( n \\) alone is odd, then the quantity \\( x^{m+n} \\) becomes negative at the same time as \\( x \\), but in this case the two branches of the curve are on the same side of the line in which the abscissas are taken (as in fig. 19. N\u00b0 3.) and the ordinates remain always positive.\n\nUpon the whole it may be concluded, that the area of a curve is positive when the abscissas and the ordinates have the same sign, and negative when they have contrary signs.\n\nIf we suppose \\( m = 1 \\), and \\( n = 2 \\), then the curve is the common parabola, the area of which from the general formula is found to be\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} a^{1/2} x^{3/2} = \\frac{2}{3} xy;\n\\]\n\nhence it appears that the parabola is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of its circumscribing parallelogram.\n\n**Ex. 2.** Suppose the curve to be a circle. Put Fig. 20. \\( AB = x, BP = y \\), the diameter \\( AD = a \\), the area \\( ABP = s \\). From the nature of the circle \\( y^2 = a(x-x^2) \\), therefore \\( y = \\sqrt{(a-x-x^2)} \\), and\n\n\\[\ns = \\int y \\cdot x \\, dx = \\int \\sqrt{(a-x-x^2)} \\cdot x \\, dx\n\\]\n\nIn this case the fluxion is not of such a form as to admit of an algebraic fluent in finite terms, we must therefore have recourse to the method of series, but we have already found the fluent in this way in \u00a7 140, therefore, from the series there brought out we have\n\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{ax} \\left( \\frac{2x}{3} - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2x^2}{5a} - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2x^3}{7a^2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2x^4}{9a^3} - \\text{&c.} \\right)\n\\]\n\nthis expression does not require a constant quantity to be added to it, because when \\( x = 0 \\) we must also have \\( s = 0 \\).\n\nIf we suppose the arch \\( AP \\) to be \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the quadrant \\( AE \\), then it is known that \\( PB = \\frac{1}{4} \\) the rad. \\( AC = \\frac{1}{4} a \\), therefore, if we suppose the radius \\( = 1 \\), we have in this case \\( BC = \\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{3} \\), and \\( AB = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{3} = 0.1339746 \\) nearly. If this number be substituted instead of \\( x \\), and a few terms of the series computed, we shall find the area \\( ABP = 0.452931 \\); to this add the triangle \\( CRB = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 0.2165063 \\), and we have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTOR\">sector</a> \\( ACP = 0.2617994 \\), which number when multiplied by 3 gives \\( 7833882 \\) for the area of the quadrant. This number also expresses the area of a circle of which the diameter is 1.\n\n**Ex. 3.** Suppose the curve to be an ellipse. Put Fig. 21.\nInverse Method\n\nthe transverse axis \\( AD = a \\), the conjugate axis \\( 2CE = b \\), also \\( AB = x \\), \\( BP = y \\); then by the nature of the curve \\( y = \\frac{b}{a} \\sqrt{(ax - x^2)} \\), and \\( s = y \\dot{x} = \\frac{b}{a} \\dot{x} \\sqrt{(ax - x^2)} \\); but if a circle be described on \\( AD \\) as a diameter, and \\( BP \\) the ordinate of the ellipse be produced to meet the circle, it appears from last example that \\( \\dot{x} \\sqrt{(ax - x^2)} \\) is the fluxion of \\( AQ \\) the segment of the circle corresponding to the elliptic area \\( APB \\) or \\( s \\); therefore, putting \\( v \\) for the segment \\( AQ \\), we have\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{b}{a} \\dot{x}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s = \\frac{b}{a} \\dot{v}, \\]\n\nhere the constant quantity \\( c \\) must be suppressed because \\( s \\) and \\( v \\) must vanish together. Hence it appears that the area of any segment of an ellipse is to the area of the corresponding segment of its circumscribing circle as the lesser axis of the ellipse is to the greater; therefore the whole ellipse must be to the whole circle in the same ratio.\n\nEx. 4. Let the curve be a hyperbola, of which \\( C \\) is the centre. Put the semi-transverse axis \\( CA = a \\), the semiconjugate axis \\( CB = x \\), \\( BP = y \\), the area \\( APB = s \\). From the nature of the curve \\( y = \\frac{b}{a} \\sqrt{(x^2 - a^2)} \\), therefore\n\n\\[ s = \\int y \\dot{x} = \\frac{b}{a} \\int \\dot{x} \\sqrt{(x^2 - a^2)}. \\]\n\nBut it appears from formula B (\\$ 131.) that\n\n\\[ \\int \\dot{x} \\sqrt{(x^2 - a^2)} = \\frac{1}{2} x \\sqrt{(x^2 - a^2)} - \\frac{1}{2} a^2 \\int \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\sqrt{(x^2 - a^2)}} \\]\n\nand again by \\$ 127,\n\n\\[ \\int \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\sqrt{(x^2 - a^2)}} = 1 \\left\\{ x + \\sqrt{(x^2 - a^2)} \\right\\} + c, \\]\n\ntherefore\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{b}{2a} x \\sqrt{(x^2 - a^2)} - \\frac{ab}{2} l. \\left\\{ x + \\sqrt{(x^2 - a^2)} \\right\\} + c. \\]\n\nTo discover the value of the constant quantity \\( c \\) we must consider that when \\( x = a \\), then \\( s = 0 \\), and in this extreme case the general equation just found becomes\n\n\\[ 0 = \\frac{ab}{2} l. a + c \\]\n\nhence \\( c = \\frac{ab}{2} l. a \\), and consequently, observing that\n\n\\[ -\\frac{ab}{2} l. \\left\\{ x + \\sqrt{(x^2 - a^2)} \\right\\} + \\frac{ab}{2} l. a \\]\n\nwe get\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{b}{2a} x \\sqrt{(x^2 - a^2)} - \\frac{ab}{2} l. \\left\\{ x + \\sqrt{(x^2 - a^2)} \\right\\} \\]\n\nIt immediately follows from this formula that\n\n\\[ \\frac{b}{2a} x \\sqrt{(x^2 - a^2)} - s = \\frac{ab}{2} l. \\left\\{ x + \\sqrt{(x^2 - a^2)} \\right\\} \\]\n\nbut if a straight line be drawn from \\( C \\) to \\( P \\) so as form the triangle \\( CBP \\), it is manifest that \\( \\frac{b}{2a} x \\sqrt{(x^2 - a^2)} \\) is equal to \\( \\frac{1}{2} CB \\times BP \\), that is to the triangle \\( CBP \\), therefore the excess of the triangle \\( CBP \\) above the area \\( s \\), that is the hyperbolic sector \\( <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">CAP</a> \\) is equal to the logarithmic function\n\n\\[ \\frac{ab}{2} l. \\left\\{ x + \\sqrt{(x^2 - a^2)} \\right\\}. \\]\n\nEx. 5. Suppose the curve to be an equilateral hyperbola, that is a hyperbola whose axes are equal, and that it is required to find the curvilinear area \\( DCBP \\) comprehended between \\( DC \\), a perpendicular from \\( D \\) (a given point in the curve) to one of the asymptotes, and \\( PB \\), a perpendicular from any other point in the curve to the same asymptote.\n\nLet \\( A \\) be the centre, put \\( AC = a \\), \\( CD = b \\), \\( AB = x \\), \\( BP = y \\), the area \\( DCBP = s \\). From the property of the asymptotes we have \\( xy = ab \\), and therefore \\( y = \\frac{ab}{x} \\), hence (\\$ 103.)\n\n\\[ s = \\int y \\dot{x} = \\int \\frac{ab}{x} \\dot{x} = abl. x + c. \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( c \\), let us suppose \\( x = a \\), then \\( s = 0 \\) and the general formula becomes in this case\n\n\\[ 0 = abl. a + c, \\]\n\nand hence \\( c = -abl. a \\),\n\ntherefore\n\n\\[ s = abl. x - abl. a = abl. \\frac{x}{a}. \\]\n\nIf we suppose \\( a = b = 1 \\), then \\( s = 1 \\cdot x \\), from which it appears that in this case the hyperbolic area \\( DCBP \\) represents the Napierian logarithm of the number \\( x \\); it was from the consideration of this property that the logarithms originally invented by Napier were called hyperbolic logarithms.\n\nBut the logarithms of any other system may also be represented by areas of the same hyperbola; for this purpose it is only necessary to determine the magnitudes of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), so that \\( \\frac{b}{a} = M \\), where \\( M \\) denotes the modulus of the system, thus we shall have \\( ab = a^2 M \\), and \\( s = a^2 M l. \\frac{x}{a} \\), or, putting \\( a = 1 \\), \\( s = M l. x \\), an expression for the logarithm of \\( x \\) according to any system whatever of which the modulus is \\( M \\) (\\( \\text{ALGEBRA} \\), \u00a7 287.).\n\nEx. 6. Let the curve be the cycloid of which \\( AE \\) is the axis and \\( A \\) the vertex, let a semicircle be described on \\( AE \\) as a diameter, draw \\( AG \\) perpendicular to the axis, and from any point in the curve draw \\( PB \\) perpendicular to \\( AG \\) and \\( PD \\) perpendicular to \\( AE \\), meeting the circle in \\( Q \\) and draw \\( QC \\) to \\( C \\) the centre of the circle.

In some cases it is more convenient to refer a curve line to a fixed point than to an axis. Thus instead of expressing the nature of the circle by the equation \\( y^2 = a x - x^2 \\), where \\( y \\) denotes a perpendicular from any point of the curve upon \\( a \\) the diameter, and \\( x \\) the distance of that perpendicular from one end of the diameter, we may otherwise express it by the equation \\( z = v \\), where \\( z \\) denotes a variable arch of the circle reckoned from one end of its diameter, \\( r \\) its radius, and \\( v \\) the angle contained by a line drawn from the centre of the circle through the extremity of \\( z \\), which angle is measured by an arch of a circle having its radius unity.\n\nThe nature of the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONIC_SECTIONS\">conic sections</a> may be defined in the same manner. Let \\( P \\) be any point in a conic section, of which \\( F \\) is one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a>, and \\( FA \\) a part of the axis; let \\( DC \\) the directrix of the section meet \\( FA \\) in \\( C \\), join \\( PF \\), and draw \\( PB \\) perpendicular to the axis, and \\( PD \\) to the directrix; then from the nature of the curve (Conic Sections) \\( PF \\) has a given ratio to \\( PD \\), that is to \\( FC - FB \\); put \\( FC = a \\), \\( FP = r \\), the angle \\( PFC = v \\), and suppose \\( PF : PD :: n : 1 \\), then \\( PF = n \\cdot PD = n \\cdot FC - n \\cdot FB \\), hence, observing that \\( FB = FP \\times \\text{cof. } v \\), we get \\( r = a n - nr \\text{cof. } v \\), and \\( r = \\frac{an}{1 + n \\text{cof. } v} \\)","sp":330,"ep":384},{"h":"OINTMENTS","t":"Ointments are employed in farriery, merely as an application to sores, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of eruptions of the skin.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of applying a fomentation is, by wetting a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a> cloth in the warm liquor, wringing it slightly, and then applying it as warm as can easily be borne over the part to be fomented.\n\nIn the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of the veterinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MATERIA_MEDICA\">materia medica</a>, we shall call the substances by those names by which they are usually known to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> people; but we shall add by way of synonyms the scientific names, as derived from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> systems of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>. In fixing the doses of each article, we shall, unless particularly mentioned to the contrary, only specify the dose proper for horses and cattle; but it would be proper for the reader to keep in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a>, that the dose for a sheep or a dog <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be about one-half or one-third of that for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> or cow.\n\nIn classing the remedies we shall adapt the arrangement given in a late compendium of the materia medica. Most writers on the materia medica of horses, have arranged their articles in alphabetical order. Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">White</a> has done this, in his excellent veterinary materia medica and pharmacopeia. Such an arrangement does very well, if intended to answer the purpose of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DICTIONARY\">dictionary</a>; but for practice, it is better to have the articles classified according to the sensible effects which they appear to produce in the system; as in this way the practitioner has before him all those remedies that are of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and may select from among them such as he thinks will best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> the particular case that he has in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>.\n\nIt may be necessary to observe, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> intended in this part is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TROY_WEIGHT\"><a class=\"x</a>ref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">troy</a> weight divided according to the apothecaries, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> English wine measure.\n\nEmetics.\n\nIt will have appeared from our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the stomach of the horse, that this animal is in general incapable of vomiting. Emetics, therefore, as calculated for him, form <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> part of the veterinary materia medica. We do not know that emetics are given either to sheep or cattle, but to dogs they may be often given with advantage. A few substances, however, will answer this purpose, as in general a little gruel, or a little mustard mixed with warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, will be sufficient to vomit a dog. The following substances may be ranked in this class for dogs.\n\na. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">Antimony</a>. Sulphuret of Antimony.\n   Emetic Tartar. Tartrate of Antimony and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POTASH\">Potash</a>.\n   Dose from two to four grains.\n\nb. Antimonial Powder. Oxide of Antimony with Phosphate of Lime.

Also recommended in canine madness.\n\nReceipt.\n\n1. Take of turpith mineral, five grains;\n   And emetic tartar, one grain.\n   Give in a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> after bleeding.\n\n2. Expectorants.\n\nThese are remedies that are calculated to produce or keep up a discharge of mucus from the lungs, or windpipe, and are thus fitted to relieve coughs and thicknesses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, or asthma.\n\na. Ammoniac. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">Gum</a> Ammoniac.\n   A gum-resin, Dose from three to five drachms, in the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">Commonly</a> combined with squill, or some other powerful expectorant, preceded by a purging medicine. Particularly suited to chronic coughs.\n\nb. Asafoetida. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERULA\">Ferula</a> asafoetida. Lin.\n   A gum resin; dose about half a drachm, in a ball.\n\nc.

Take of camphor; powdered squill, each a drachm;\n   Balsam of copaiva, half an ounce;\n   Aromatic powder, two drachms.\n   With honey, mix into a ball.\n\n4. Take of balsam of sulphur, four ounces;\n   Barbadoes tar, two ounces;\n   <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">Oil</a> of aniseed, two drachms;\n   Powdered liquorice root, enough to make a mass, to be divided into balls, each weighing about an ounce and a half, for a dose.\n\n5. Take afaetida, half an ounce;\n   Powdered ginger, a drachm and a half;\n   Prepared <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMONIA\">ammonia</a>, half a drachm;\n   Honey, &c. enough to make a ball.\n\n3. SUDORIFICS.\n\nThese are such medicines as are intended, either to keep up or bring back the infensible perspiration, or to excite profuse sweating. They are also called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAPHORETICS\">diaphoretics</a>. See Materia Medica.\n\nFew medicines are employed in farriery with a view to excite sweat. In the dog, it is well-known that this effect can scarcely be produced by any means; and in the horse it is found extremely difficult to produce any sensible sudorific effect by means of medicine. This may indeed be excited by violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> and warm clothing; but these are ill suited to the cases in which sweating would be most desirable. The infensible perspiration may, however, be gently encouraged by some powerful sweating medicines; and in cattle these may not unfrequently be given with advantage.\n\na. AMMONIA.\n\nMINDERERUS'S SPIRIT. Acetate of Ammonia.\nRecommended by Mr White as a gentle diaphoretic. Dose from eight to ten ounces in form of a drench. In febrile complaints.\n\nb. CAMPHOR. Laurus camphora. Lin.\nDose from one to two drachms, in form of a ball. In fevers.\n\nc. ANTIMONY. Sulphuret of Antimony.\nVery commonly given to horses for the purpose of improving the fineness of their coat. Dose about an ounce, in powder mixed with the food.\n\nd. EMETIC TARTAR. Tartrate of Antimony and Potash.\nDose from one to two drachms; in a ball or drench.\n\nANTIMONIAL POWDER. Oxide of Antimony with Phosphate of Lime.\nDose about two drachms.\n\ne. UNWASHED <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALX\">CALX</a> OR OXIDE OF ANTIMONY.\nDose two or three drachms, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> as below.\n\nf. NITRE. Nitrate of Potash.\nDose about one ounce in a ball, with one or two drachms of camphor; or alone in a drench.\n\ng. OPIUM. Papaver somniferum. Lin.\nSeldom given alone, though it might probably be administered with great propriety, in doses of two scruples to a drachm.\n\nReceipts for Sudorifics.\n\n6. Take of nitre half an ounce;\n   Camphor, a drachm and a half;\n   <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALOMEL\">Calomel</a>, powdered opium, a scruple;\n   Molasses, enough to make a ball. In fever.\n\n7. Take of unwashed calx of antimony, two drachms;\n   Camphor, a drachm;\n   Opium, half a drachm;\n   <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">Compound</a> powder of tragacanth, two drachms.\n   Honey enough to make a ball.\n   In fever. To be repeated occasionally.\n\n8. Take of emetic tartar from one drachm to two;\n   Compound powder of tragacanth, three drachms;\n   Honey enough to make a ball.\n\n9. Take of emetic tartar, a drachm and a half;\n   Ginger, two drachms;\n   Camphor, half a drachm;\n   Opium, a scruple;\n   Oil of caraway, ten drops.\n   Molasses enough to make a ball.\n   For horses that are hide-bound, and have unhealthy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> coats.\n\n10. Take of antimonial powder, two drachms;\n    Caraway seeds powdered, half an ounce;\n    Ginger, a drachm;\n    Oil of aniseeds, twenty drops.\n    Honey enough to make a ball.\n\n11. Take of unwashed calx or oxide of antimony, two drachms;\n    Prepared ammonia, ginger, of each a drachm;\n    Opium, half a drachm;\n    Powdered aniseeds, half an ounce;\n    Molasses, enough to make a ball.\n\n4. DIURETICS.\n\nThese are remedies that are intended to produce a diuretic more than ordinary discharge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>. See Materia Medica.\n\nDiuretics.\nDiuretics are frequently given to horses, not only in cases of dropical swellings, especially of the legs, but in gout, and in many eruptive diseases; in running ulcers, cracks, or ulcers about the heels; in baldness of different parts of the body; and in some cases where there appears to be a difficulty in flaring.\n\nThey are usually given in the form of balls, but some of them by way of powder mixed with the food. Before exhibiting diuretics, bleeding is sometimes requisite. These cases will be stated in their proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. It is also proper, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of diuretics, that the animal should take regular exercise; and occasional drink should be given, to promote their operation. The use of them should not be continued too long, as they are found to produce considerable weakness.\n\na. Balsam of Copaiva. See Expectorants.\nThis medicine, when given as directed under expectorants, frequently acts as a diuretic.\n\nb. Camphor. See Sudorifics.\nDose about two drachms, mixed with nitre in a ball. In spasmodic difficulty of flaring.\n\nc. Nitre. Nitrate of Potash.\nDose about one ounce, in the form of powder, ball, or drench. In fevers and strangury.\n\nd. Potash. Subcarbonate of Potash, or Vegetable Alkali.\nDose a drachm or two.\n\ne. Rosin.\nDose from two to four drachms repeated occasionally, in the form of powder with the food.\nRosin is a good diuretic in cases of swollen legs and greasy heels, but is seldom given, except to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CART\">cart</a>-horses.\n\nf. Soap. Castile Soap.\nDose from two to six drachms, in composition.\n\ng. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">Tobacco</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NICOTIANA\">Nicotiana</a> tabacum. Lin.\nSometimes given by grooms for fining a horse's coat.\n\nh. Turpentine.\na. Common turpentine.\nb. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> turpentine. Dose from half an ounce to an ounce; in the form of emulsion.\n\ni. Oil or Spirit of Turpentine.\nDose from one ounce to two.\n\nReceipts for Diuretics.\n\n12. Take of Castile soap, powdered rosin, of each three drachms;\nNitre, half an ounce;\nOil of juniper, a drachm.\nFirst <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> the soap and oil of juniper together, and then add the other ingredients, to make a ball.\n\n13. Take of nitre in powder, half an ounce;\nCamphor, oil of juniper, of each one drachm;\nCastile soap, three drachms.\nRub the camphor and oil together, then add the soap and nitre, and as much flour as is sufficient to make it into a ball.\n\nTake of rosin and nitre, each half an ounce.\nMix into a powder, to be taken with the food.\n\n5. Purges.\nThese medicines are well known. They are generally considered of two kinds; laxatives, or such as gently move the bowels, and are intended merely to empty them of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCREMENT\">excrement</a>; and purges, or such as, besides this effect, are intended to stimulate the exhalent vessels of the intestines, and produce a considerable discharge of liquid stools. (See Materia Medica.) As either order may in general be given so as to produce either of these effects, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> in which it is administered, we shall consider them together.\n\nPurgative medicines are given with considerable advantage to all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> animals, in many cases of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, which will be pointed out hereafter. They are very commonly, however, given to horses, by grooms and ordinary farriers, by way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> or preventive of disease; or in order, as they think, the better to prepare them for some unusual exertion. The reason given for this practice is, that the horse is foul in the body, or full of humours, and the purgatives are given to expel this morbid accumulation of humours.\n\n\"This sort of evacuation (says Dr. Bracken, who is improperly one of the first that pointed out the absurdity of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> practice), seems very much to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUADRATURE\">quadrature</a> with the outward fumes, and makes the ignorant part of mankind, horses whose heads are fuller of humours than their horses, imagine that purging medicines carry off the offending <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> in most disorders; never considering the general rule, which ought still to be kept in mind, viz. that in proportion to any one evacuation being heightened or increased, most or all of the other natural evacuations are proportionally diminished.\n\nIt must be remembered that the intestines of the horse are exceedingly long, and the large intestines are so constructed as in many cases to retain the food or excrement for a very considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. Purgative medicines given to a horse are often retained for 24 or 36 hours; and if these have been of an irritating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, it is evident that the unnecessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of them may often produce considerable mischief. Mr. Blaine says, that when horses die after the exhibition of strong purges, which according to him is not unfrequently the case, he has always found the large intestines more or less inflamed.\n\nIt is found that after giving a horse a strong purge, he is often incapable of returning to his usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> for many days; it is even said for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>. Hence it will easily appear how absurd is the practice of those who physic their horses without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>. Mr. John Lawrence is, however, still an advocate for purging horses now and then, and is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that the mischief done by purges is to be attributed to the coarseness of the medicine, rather than to its purging effect. He declares, that after 30 years <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, he has never known purging do harm, if the aloes employed was of the finer sort.\n\nVeterinary practitioners differ with respect to the time of administering a purge. Mr. Blaine recommends it to be given in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, when the horse is to be allowed to fast from 9 or 10 o'clock to 12 or 1. Then a lock or two of hay, or about two handfuls, is to be given him, and after this he is to have the ball, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>...\nhorn full of warm ale, or water-gruel, immediately after it. He is then to fast for another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, when he is to be allowed the moderate use of hay. He should have all his drink a little warm; should be walked about gently during the remainder of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and should have a warm bath at night. Next day he is to be again moderately exercised at intervals, till the purge begins to operate; but if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> is severe, he must be covered with body clothes, and care must be taken not to have the stable too warm when he returns. Mr Clark recommends a bath of bran to be given about an hour before the bath, and says that in this way he has always found the medicine to operate in a gentle and easy manner.\n\nIt is a common practice with many people to ride their horses very hard before giving them a purging medicine, with the view, as they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> it, to stir up the humours, which being thus set afloat, will more easily be carried off by the purge. To say no more with respect to the absurdity of the doctrine, we may remark that the practice itself is highly dangerous, as a purge administered after such violent exercise, will seldom fail to produce inflammation in the bowels, fevers, or some other disorder, which, though it may not at the time prove fatal, may lay the foundation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLINDNESS\">blindness</a>, incurable lameness, or some other disorder that may render the horse useless. Violent exercise, after administering a purge, is equally to be avoided, as it may produce sweating, and thus counteract the purgative effect; or, what is as bad, it will tend to increase the weakness that seldom fails to be brought on by purging.\n\nWe have been the more particular in our observations on purging horses, as it is a matter of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, and as the effect of indiscriminate purging in this animal is little understood.\n\n**a. Aloes.** *Aloe perfoliata.* Lin.\n\n- Socotrine aloes. Dose from five to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> drachms.\n- Barbadoes aloes.

Calomel.** Sul-muriate, or mild muriate of mercury.\n\nDose from one to two drachms, usually mixed with other purgatives.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> complaints, obstinate cases of grease, chronic inflammation of the eyes, and dropical swellings of the hind-legs.\n\n**k. Glauber's Salt.** Sulphate of Soda.\n\nDose about a pound. Best given in the form of a clyster. In fevers, and inflammatory complaints.\n\n**l.

Introduction); it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be allowed that there is some ground for the surmise.\nDomestic animals are subject to eruptive diseases, both chronic, and such as are attended with fever; and both are very similar to those by which man is affected. It is pretty certain that the smallpox sometimes rages among sheep, as we shall see hereafter; and a complaint very like the measles often attacks swine. Some of them are transferable to man; and to this transference in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of the cowpox, a blessing which will render immortal the name of Jenner, we owe the probable annihilation of one of the most dreadful pests that ever afflicted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>.\n\nScrofula and consumption attack monkeys. Apoplexy, epilepsy, and many others of what are called nervous diseases, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGESTION\">indigestion</a>, and even mental derangement, are not uncommon among domestic animals; spasmodic affections are very frequent among them, and it is said, that for one case of tetanus or locked jaw among the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> in these climates, there are ten or twenty among horses.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> might be pursued much farther; but what has been stated is sufficient to show the advantages that medical men may derive from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of veterinary medicine. Many obscure and dangerous diseases may thus in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> be illustrated or mitigated; and the effect of doubtful remedies may be ascertained by experiments on the inferior animals. For, though there are a few instances of different effects following the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of the same medicines in man and animals; yet, on the whole, the analogy is nearly as complete with respect to remedies as diseases (B).\n\nIt will appear, from what has been said, that the reasoning, and much of the treatment, in the diseases of animals must be nearly the same as in man, and, of course, that the veterinary practitioner will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> much by acquiring a knowledge of human medicine. Were the practitioners in farriery generally instructed in the principles of medicine, little more would be required, in a treatise on farriery, than to point out the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in the structure and functions of domestic animals, to describe the diseases peculiar to them, and to mark the varieties that it is necessary to observe in the treatment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> and the administration of remedies. But, as many of these gentlemen have not the opportunity of attending medical lectures, and most of them have not received an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> that would enable them to understand the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> in which medical writings are usually composed; it becomes necessary in a treatise of this kind to accommodate the language to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and capacity of general readers, and to introduce much that will be found in other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> on subjects connected with medicine. To prevent repetition, as much as possible, and to avoid swelling this article to a greater length than is necessary, we shall, however, where the similarity of the subject will admit of it, occasionally refer to some of the medical articles in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DICTIONARY\">dictionary</a>.\n\nThe successful practice of farriery, like that of medicine in general, requires that the practitioner should possess a considerable share of knowledge. It is not sufficient to have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of managing the veterinary horses and cattle; this indeed, to a person of a strong mind, and attentive observation, will furnish a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of facts, with respect to the symptoms and progress of the diseases to which domestic animals are subject. But, to mark the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> differences between such as resemble each other, to investigate their causes, and to contrive a rational <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of treatment, requires a much greater share of abilities, and much more extensive information, than we can expect to find among grooms and shepherds, or falls to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> of most of those, who call themselves farriers and cattle-doctors.\n\nIt must be obvious to every thinking mind, that no Anatomy practice either in medicine or farriery can be rational, but such as is founded on a comprehensive knowledge of the structure and functions of those animals, the treatment of whose diseases is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of that practice. The first thing, therefore, necessary to the veterinary practitioner is, to acquire some idea of the anatomical structure of the domestic animals. We have already, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> part of the article Anatomy, given a general account of the structure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a>; and in exemplifying this, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> on the anatomy of a dog, we pointed out the most striking peculiarities that are to be found in this animal; as we have done with respect to ruminating animals, viz. the cow and sheep, in the succeeding chapter of that part. To that article we must refer our readers for the anatomical part of our subject, as far as relates to the ox, the sheep, and the dog. It will naturally be expected, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the structure of the horse should be given in this article; but this description must, in general, be concise, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> prevents us from enlarging on the subject, excepting in those parts where a pretty minute knowledge appears to be necessary.\n\nThose who wish to study the anatomy of the horse minutely, may consult Vitet's Medicine Veterinaire, tom. i.; Blaine's Outlines, and Stubb's elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> on the anatomy of the horse.\n\nThe practitioner should take every opportunity of inspecting the bodies of those animals that die of diseases, which are very important, or which are not very well understood. Morbid affections often throw considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the nature and treatment of diseases; and it fortunately happens, that with respect to domestic animals, these affections are very easy, and are not obstructed by those absurd prejudices, which, especially in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, are opposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> of human bodies. In treating of the diseases of domestic animals, in\n\n(B) One of the most remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of anomaly in the effect of remedies is that of arsenic, which, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of a few grains will prove a deadly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> to man and most animals, but may be given with impunity to horses to the amount of two drams or more. The story of the different effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a>, on hogs and monkeys, is well known. See Antimony. As to the example of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> vitriol, (fulphate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a>), which proves emetic in the human subject, but produces no such effect in the horse; it is owing to the different structure of the stomach in this animal, by which he is incapable of vomiting. Colocynthis, or bitter apple, is well known to be a most violent purgative to man, but in the horse it has produced no effect, in the enormous dose of four ounces.\na future part of this article, we shall give a concise view of the appearances on disease, as far as they have been ascertained, whenever they tend to illustrate the nature, causes, or treatment of the disease under consideration.\n\nThe study of the functions of domestic animals ought to go <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> in hand with that of their structure; and the student will find it of considerable advantage, to compare the functions of these animals with those of man. This comparative view will be given in some future article. In the present treatise, we can only speak of the functions of domestic animals, as far as it is necessary to illustrate the nature or the treatment of their diseases.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of these animals ought to form a part of the studies of the veterinary practitioner. It is a subject that is not only highly curious and interesting, but extremely useful. We find, that these animals, in their native fields, enjoy a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> and vigour, which is interrupted only by those accidents to which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> and wildness may expose them. It is only when they are received under the protection of man, that they become subject to disease. It is therefore an interesting inquiry, to examine into their native habits; as, in our endeavours to preserve their health, we should, as nearly as is compatible with convenience and economy, imitate the habits that are found to prevail among these animals in a state of nature. It is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of the naturalist to describe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> conformation of these animals, and the advantages, and defects dependant on it, that fit or disqualify them for the various purposes, for which they are destined under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of man; it is his business to describe the methods of breeding these animals in a state of nature, and how far this may be improved for the purposes of domestication, and to detail the method of training and managing them. Many of these circumstances are treated of by some of the writers on the veterinary art, in a complete system of which they ought not properly to be omitted. We shall, however, not treat of them in this article, as, according to the plan of our work, they more properly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to be considered under the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAMMALIA\">MAMMALIA</a>, in which will be given the natural history of all quadrupeds.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a> must form a necessary part of the studies of every man who engages in the practice of medicine, whether human or veterinary, as, without a knowledge of its principles, neither the functions of the animal economy, the intimate structure of its component parts, nor the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of many remedies, can be properly understood. In the article CHEMISTRY, we have prepared abundant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> for the reader to make himself acquainted with the elements of that admirable science.\n\nThe practitioner, whether of human or veterinary medicine, who is a proficient in anatomy, wants but a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> dexterity, and some practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, to make him a tolerable surgeon. The operations to be performed on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a> are few, and these are in general very clumsily executed. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">Humanity</a>, however, as well as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, will readily point out to the farrier the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of learning the best methods of performing these operations with dexterity and despatch, so as to give the least pain to the unfortunate animals that are placed under his care. We shall describe the usual operations immediately after treating of the anatomy of the horse.\n\nIt is of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, that the person who undertakes the management of domestic animals, should make himself acquainted with those circumstances which experience has shewn to be most favourable to the preservation of their health, and the prevention of their diseases. This subject forms what may be called veterinary hygeiology; and will be considered at some length in the fourth part of this article.\n\nBefore the practitioner can attempt to remove or alleviate the diseases to which domestic animals are subjected, he must acquire a competent knowledge of the remedies employed for that purpose, their nature, uses, and doses, as adapted to the different animals, in various situations, and various diseases; with the methods of preparing and compounding them into the several forms that are usually employed; and with the best means of administering them. This comprehends what is called the veterinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MATERIA_MEDICA\">materia medica</a>, and will form the subject of our fifth part.\n\nWith this previous knowledge, the veterinary practitioner is prepared to enter on the consideration of the diseases, which will be treated of in the sixth part of our article. He must be particularly attentive to the symptoms of each disease, as, on an accurate knowledge of these, will depend the means of distinguishing these complaints, which upon a superficial view bear considerable resemblance to each other, but which require a very different, and perhaps opposite mode of treatment. He must attend to the greater or less violence of these symptoms, to the nature of the part which they attack, and to the greater or less rapidity of their progress; as these circumstances must considerably influence the judgment he is to form of the danger, and probable termination, of the disease. He must, as far as possible, investigate the causes, that appear to have produced the disease in question, or which seem to aggravate or keep up the morbid symptoms; as on the removal or mitigation of these causes, must depend the only rational and scientific method of cure. Lastly, he must make himself acquainted with the treatment that experience has found most successful in the cure of each particular disease, as well as with that which has been found to be attended with little or no advantage.\n\nAs the proper means of attaining the best information is of the greatest importance, we shall here give Mr Blaine's instructions on this point.\n\n\"The mode in which any art is attained, must be in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> directed by the future views of the learners. It appears to me that there are three distinct classes of persons, who are likely to study this branch of useful knowledge. The first are persons of enlarged minds, and extended fortunes. The second are surgeons, whose situation in country villages may render their services in this art highly useful, upon occasions when no farrier is at hand, or, in the end, in cases in which farriers of the common class are unable to judge. The third are farriers themselves, or persons intending to profess veterinary medicine.\n\n\"Gentlemen and amateurs, who wish to accumulate information on this curious and interesting subject, within the reach of the veterinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, will find their account in attending a course of lectures there; if not,\nnot, they should apply themselves to the study of the more general parts of the body, both of the human and animal; the latter, I hope, they may attain by the following sheets. They may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the collar maker, huntsman, or tanner, to cut up their dead horses in their presence. They may study physiology in a pleasant and interesting manner, from the ingenious work on this subject by Mr Saumarez. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> parts of the veterinary art may be acquired with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, from the elegant publication of Mr Richard Lawrence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRMINGHAM\">Birmingham</a>, and a course of chemistry will amply reward them for their pains in acquiring it.\n\n\"A good surgeon has travelled three-fourths of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> towards making a good veterinarian, but he must diligently travel the remainder to arrive at excellence. He must by no means sit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> contented with the analogy between the human and brute; which, if he does, will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> him into very great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>; for though this analogy is in most cases very striking, yet there are others in which the similarity fails, and he is left to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> upon other principles. Hence those diseases that are conquered or mitigated by vomiting in the human; in the horse he must pursue another mode of treatment. In acute diseases removed by purging in the human, his attempts on the horse would probably fail; as before the effects were produced, the animal might be past relief. It must be remembered that the operations of medicines are very different in the one, and the other. It is not sufficient that a surgeon has an intimate acquaintance with the human frame; he must be equally conversant with the animal he treats, or he will treat in vain; particularly those diseases originating in a peculiarity of form from the human, as all the diseases of the feet. He should make himself particularly conversant with the specific diseases of the horse, which bear no analogy to anything in the human body; as farcy, glanders, strangles, greale, &c. From the great strength of the arterial system, he must ever be aware how prone the diseases of the horse are to a rapid termination, and hence that his treatment must be decisive and energetic; therefore, in all cases, he must be very attentive to diagnostics. But what will much embarrass a surgeon in practising the veterinary art, will be a want of knowledge of the general usages, nomenclature, and idioms, if I may so express it, among grooms and farriers; without an acquaintance with which, these people at once detect and despise the practitioner. It should be the business therefore of the surgeon, with his other acquisitions, to learn their manners, and to make himself acquainted with their terms. The third class of persons, either farriers already practising, or persons intending to practise, will easily gain that. When it is in their power, I would advise their taking the advantage of the veterinary college; but when they cannot, I would recommend the prosecution of their studies in a regular manner. Begin by first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> some general description of the human body, such as Symond's Anatomy, or the anatomical part of the present work, carefully; let them pay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the functions and uses of the parts, particularly where the same uses are brought about by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> in structure; this enlarges the mind, and prepares it to receive the benefits of dissection, which should now be proceeded to. Any small animal may be first dissected, to enable the learner to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> his instruments properly. He may then proceed to dissect the horse with some authorities by him, which will assist him at first to make out parts, but too scrupulous an attention to numerous descriptions will only bewilder. The necessary instructions for dissection, and the preservation of parts, may be gained, by a recourse to Poole's Anatomical Instructor, which is professedly written to instruct the pupil in these particulars. When he is well acquainted with the appearance of the animal in health, he should take every opportunity of examining diseased appearances, which are seldom wanting at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAN\">tan</a>-yard or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENNEL\">kennel</a>. He should now make himself acquainted more intimately with physiology, for which purpose he may read Haller's works; there is at present a translation of Cuvier's Treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARATIVE_ANATOMY\">Comparative Anatomy</a>, which he may likewise avail himself of. When he has become acquainted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATHOLOGY\">pathology</a>, as at present received, he may peruse the older authors on farriery; to this should succeed a knowledge in chemistry, preceded by an acquaintance with the materia medica; the proper works for which he may see by a reference to that article, and nothing will now be wanting, but experience and practice to perfect him.\"\n\nSince the establishment of a veterinary school in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, little is wanting to promote the progress and improvement of the veterinary art, as far as relates to the knowledge of farriery. But the art, with respect to the medical treatment of other animals, is still in the most deplorable state of imperfection. Proposals have been made for improving cattle medicine; and among these, we think the following of Mr John Lawrence, entitled to attention; though, probably the proposer's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of works may be much improved and enlarged, by referring to the account of authors which will be immediately given.\n\nMr Lawrence's proposal is simply, \"that the affair of Mr Lawrence providing the country with regular-bred surgeons, for once's proposal, the practice of cattle medicine, be immediately undertaken by the agricultural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>; at least, that the experiment be made by some of the most considerable, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> engaging a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> of that description, at a sufficient and respectable annual stipend. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> may run in such form, that should the surgeon's annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a> from practice come short of the stipulated sum, the deficiency should annually be made up by his patrons the society. No person to be engaged on any pretence, but who shall have received the usual education of a surgeon, and have attended the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a> the usual length of time. A selection of Veterinary text-books to be made, and the books purchased for the use of the surgeon, but to remain the property of the society. This may consist of Gibbon's last edition, two vols. Bracken, Bartlett, Osmer, Layard, with our late writers; and Lafoile and Bourgelat from the French, with whatever may have been published since their time, by authority of the French veterinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>. All the members of the society and their connections, as far as their influence may extend, to entrust the care of their diseased animals to the surgeon appointed, at a fair and liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> for his attendance and medicines. The surgeon to keep a regular history of all the cases which shall come under his inspection, including the presumed causes and symptoms of the disease, with the probable methods of prevention, his mode of treatment, a particular detail of the medicines prescribed, their operation, with every relative and useful remark which may occur.\"\nPART I. HISTORY.\n\nTHE early history of farriery, as of every other art and science, is involved in great obscurity. We shall not attempt to penetrate the cloud that hangs over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> state of the art, or to supply the want of facts, by conjectures, which, however rational, can lead to no certain or useful conclusions.\n\nThere seems no doubt that in the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a>, and probably long before, the medical practitioner exercised his office in favour of the domestic animals, as well as of man; and Galen seems to have been well skilled in the knowledge and treatment of some of the diseases of animals.\n\nPerhaps the earliest authentic writings on the subject of the veterinary art, now extant, are to be found in the works of Columella, the celebrated Roman author on husbandry, who, in his work *De Re Rustica*, has given many sensible directions for the management of horses and cattle. Columella lived about the second century, under the reign of the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Tiberius, or, as some say, of Claudius Caesar.\n\nIt is understood that Celsus, the elegant imitator of Hippocrates, who lived some time before Columella, wrote much on the diseases of animals; but none of his writings on this subject have survived the general wreck of science and literature that accompanied the fall of the Roman empire.\n\nWe have no certain accounts of any author who wrote expressly on this subject earlier than Vegetius, who flourished, as is supposed, sometime in the fourth century, and probably during the reign of the emperor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VALENTINIAN\">Valentinian</a> the third. The work of Vegetius, *De Arte Veterinaria*, is still considered as extremely valuable, as it has handed down to us the only certain account of the opinions and practice of the early practitioners in this art. The body of the work appears to have been compiled from the most celebrated Greek writers on the subject. It is divided into four books; the prefaces or introductory chapters to which are written in very elegant language.\n\nAn edition of Vegetius was published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASIL\">Basil</a>, in 1574; and the work has been translated into several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> languages. Such of our readers as wish for a particular account of the contents of Vegetius's treatise, will find a copious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of it, in the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of M. Vitet's *Medicine Veterinaire*.\n\nA collection of fragments of ancient writers on the veterinary art, was made by Ruellius, physician to Francis I., <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of France. It was first published in Latin, in the year 1530; and afterwards, in 1637, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> Greek was published. The writers who contributed to this collection were chiefly Abysetus, Fumelius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIEROCLES\">Hierocles</a>, Patagonius, and Theonetus. Some part of this collection is tolerably good; but, on the whole, it appears to be a strange jumble of good, bad, and indifferent, collected without judgment, and arranged without taste.\n\nIt is said that Xenophon, who lived three or four hundred years before the Christian era, wrote a small treatise in twelve chapters, on the training, management, and external <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of horses; but, as he says little or nothing with respect to their diseases, he cannot properly be ranked among the writers on veterinary medicine.\n\nA blank of more than a thousand years now occurs dark ages in the history of farriery. During this long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of darkness, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, and barbarity, the veterinary art, like most others, rather went back than advanced. During some part of this gloom, however, the art of shoeing horses with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> appears to have been invented; an art which seems to have contributed not a little to throw the management of this noble animal into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of a set of errant blockheads, who were now first called farriers. We cannot here enter on a discussion of the medical pretensions of these guardians of the health of horses. They have been amply commented on, by some of the best writers on the subject of farriery, as Gibbon, Bracken, Lafoffe, and particularly Mr John Lawrence, to whose useful and humane treatise on horses we refer our readers for some very spirited remarks on the subject.\n\nThe first modern writer on farriery, whom we can mention, is Carlo Ruini, an Italian, who, in 1618, published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> his *Anatomia del Cavallo*. This work, of which very few copies are now to be found, is embellished with many copperplates, which, for the time when they were engraved, are very elegant. It is said that many succeeding writers on the anatomy of the horse have been indebted to them for most of their figures.\n\nWe now come to a period at which the veterinary art began to assume something of a scientific form. Many writers of eminence began to appear both in France and England, countries which have been the most distinguished for their attention to the management and diseases of domestic animals. As the French writers were the first, who did anything considerable towards the improvement of farriery, we shall trace the progress of the art in that country, before we examine the improvements it has received in England.\n\nIn 1698 Solleyef published his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> work, \"Le Solleyef.\"\nFAR R I E R Y.\n\nHistory.\n\nparfait Marechal,\" the complete Horseman, a work, which gained its author a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> reputation, and was long the only guide, as well in farriery as in the manege.\n\nM. Solleyfel was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> riding-master in France, and this situation led him to pay much attention to the diseases of horses; and being a man of considerable abilities, and enlightened understanding, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the errors that prevailed in his time; and his genius and experience led him to expose and to correct them. His practical observations and remarks, which it would be out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> to particularize in this early part of our article, in general merit considerable attention. His observations on the external figure of the horse, and of his blemishes and defects, are also very valuable. It is much to be regretted that this ingenious author had not studied the anatomy of the horse, as he would then have avoided many errors and much false reasoning, into which his ignorance of anatomy betrayed him. Solleyfel's work passed through many editions, and was translated into most of the modern languages. A version of it into English was executed by Sir William Hope, one of his pupils, early in the 18th century.\n\nThe dreadful havoc committed by the murrain or epidemic diseases among horned cattle, that ravaged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> during the first half of the 18th century, attracted the attention of medical men, and thus led the way to a greater improvement in the veterinary art, than it had ever before experienced. These epidemics were first described by two Italian physicians, Ramazzini, in a treatise De Contagione Epidemica; and Lancisi, physician to the pope, in a treatise De Bovina Pestis. But the most celebrated works on the prevailing epidemic seem to have been written by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> in France. Among the first appeared a memoir by M. Hermant, physician to the king.\n\nIn 1746 was published a memoir Sur la Maladie Epidemique des B\u0153ufs du Vivarais, by the celebrated zoologist Sauvages.\n\nAbout the middle of this century, the first steps were taken towards the establishment of schools for the public instruction of practitioners in farriery. One of the most celebrated of these was the veterinary college of Lyons.\n\nOver this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> presided the famous Bourgelat, a name that will be ever respectable in the history of farriery. Besides his office of professor at Lyons, he was inspector general of the veterinary schools in France; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSARY\">commissary</a> general to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> stables; honorary member of the Royal Academy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, and member of the Royal Academy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>. M. Bourgelat was a voluminous writer, and most of his works are still in much repute. In 1752, he published Elements d'Hippiatrique, \"Elements of Farriery,\" in 3 vols. The first volume is divided into eight chapters, comprehending the knowledge of the horse, as far as regards his external form. The first chapter treats of the denomination and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the parts that compose the body of this animal; the second treats of the beauties and defects of the fore part of the horse, or what the French writers call l'Avant Main; the third treats of the beauties and defects of the several parts of the body; the fourth, of the beauties and defects of the hind part of the horse, or l'Arri\u00e8re Main; the fifth, of the different marks of horses; the sixth, of the means of ascertaining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of horses; the seventh, of the geometrical proportions of the horse; and the eighth, of shoeing.\n\nThe second volume describes the anatomy of the horse, as far as relates to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>, the integuments, the muscles, and blood vessels; and the third volume concludes the anatomy with a description of the parts that compose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>.\n\nIn 1745, M. Bourgelat's materia medica, for the use of the veterinary pupils, came out. Soon after was published his Elementary Treatise on the Anatomy of the Horse, which is the most complete work of the kind that has ever yet appeared. In 1766 he published his Elementary Botanical Demonstrations, for the use of the pupils of the veterinary college. He likewise gave to the world a treatise on bandages applicable to the horse.\n\nM. Bourgelat also furnished many of the best articles on farriery for the French Encyclop\u00e9die.\n\nAbout this time appeared a number of works on the Buffon and manege, and on natural history, particularly a work by Daubenton, M. de la Gu\u00e9rin\u00e8re, entitled \u00c9cole de Cavalerie, and the celebrated natural history by M. de Buffon and Daubenton; but as these works have little connection with the diseases of animals, which they mention only incidentally, we shall not here particularize their contents.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">Contemporary</a> with Bourgelat, and equal to him in Lafoffe the celebrity, flourished Lafoffe the Elder, a member of Elder Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, and farrier to the king of France. He made many discoveries, and introduced several valuable improvements in the art of farriery, particularly an improved method of shoeing, and a treatise on the glanders. These were at first communicated in the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> to the French academy, and published in their annals. They were afterwards collected in 1754 into one volume, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Observations et D\u00e9couvertes faites sur des Chevaux, \"Observations and Discoveries on Horses.\" We shall have occasion, in future parts of our article, to consider the merits of these memoirs, which were well received, and have contributed much to the advancement of farriery.\n\nThe elder Lafoffe also wrote some of the articles on farriery in the Encyclop\u00e9die.\n\nHe was soon followed by his son Lafoffe the Younger, who occupied the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> as his father, Younger and has acquired much reputation, by following his steps, and extending his improvements. He published, in 1766, his Guide de Marechal; or \"Farrier's Guide;\" a work well known in this country, though it has never, we believe, appeared in an English dress. It is divided into five parts, treating, 1st, Of the means of ascertaining the age of horses, and a succinct enumeration of the several parts; 2d, Of the blunders and tricks of farriers; 3d, Of the internal diseases of the horse; 4th, Of the external diseases, and the most important operations; and, 5th, Of shoeing. This work is characterized by M. Vitet, as one of the most accurate, simplest, and most precise, that had ever appeared. The anatomical part of the work is short, but comprehensive, and is illustrated by some tolerably good plates. It appears to have been a sort of text-book to a course of lectures on farriery, which were afterwards, in 1772, published in a superb form, with 65 coloured plates, under the title of Cours de Hippiatrique; or \"Course of\nThis work is extremely scarce in Britain, where, according to Mr Blaine, there are only three copies of it; one of which belongs to the Medical Society of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOLWICH\">Woolwich</a>; another is in the hands of a Mr Mathaia, ci-devant pupil of the Veterinary College; and he believes Mr Morecroft has a third.\n\nBut the principal work of the younger Lafoffe is his Dictionary d'Hippiatrique, in four volumes, which is little known in this country, and which we have not seen. Mr Blaine calls it \"the best practical system of farriery that had ever appeared.\"\n\nIn 1803 was published an abridgement of M. Lafoffe's Guide, of which an English translation has lately appeared under the title of The Veterinarian's Pocket Manual. It is a useful little book, but it is a pity that the author or translator had not observed a more methodical arrangement.\n\nThough, for the sake of uniformity, we have mentioned the younger Lafoffe immediately after his father; there were many works published in France between the Memoirs and the Guide.\n\nIn 1755, M. Garfault published his Nouveau parfait Marechal, an improvement on the Parfait Marechal of Solleylel. It is divided into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> treatises; on the Conformation of the Horse; on Haras, or the Method of Breeding; on Stables; on the Diseases of Horses; on Operations; on Shoeing; and on Horse Medicines. This work is not without defects, but, for the most part, it is very good, and by no means deserves the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> character given of it by Mr Blaine in his History of the Veterinary Art, that it \"does not seem to merit any distinction in this place.\"\n\nThe articles on farriery in the Encyclopedie that had been written by Bourgelat and Genon, called forth a work from M. Ronden, senior, farrier to the larger stables of the king; who, in 1759, published Observations sur les Articles de l'Encyclopedie concernant la Marechallerie. They appear to be ingenious, and contain much practical information.\n\nIn 1763 there appeared at Paris a work on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> in two volumes 4to, entitled La Nouvelle Maison Rustique, which contains much useful matter respecting the breeding, management, and diseases of domestic animals, as well as fowls as quadrupeds.\n\nThe contagious epidemics among horned cattle still appeared occasionally in France and other parts of Europe; and many essays were written on them by various physicians, particularly by M. Bovand of Befanon, in 1766; by M. Leclerc and M. Barbaret, of Paris, in the same year.\n\nIn 1768 Daubenton, the celebrated naturalist, already mentioned, published a memoir on the mechanism of rumination in sheep; and in 1769, appeared a small volume entitled La Medicine des Beles a Laine; \"the Medical Treatment of Sheep.\"\n\nBetween 1776 and 1782, M. Vitet, a physician at Lyons, published his Medecine Veterinaire, in 3 vols 8vo, of which the first contains a pretty full account of the anatomy of the horse and ox, with some judicious remarks on the beauties and defects of both, and on some of the more important operations to which they are exposed; the second treats of the diseases of horses, sheep, and cattle; and the third gives an account of the remedies employed in veterinary medicine; and ends with a copious analysis of most of the continental writings, and a few English, that had appeared on the subject, from Vegetius to 1770.\n\nM. Vitet's work is, for the most part, a compilation from the best writers who have gone before him; but as he had read much, and appears to have selected with judgment, his book is one of those which may be consulted with advantage. We know that it bears a high character in France, and is often quoted with respect. We are therefore disposed to rate it at a higher value than a late writer has done; and are inclined to suspect that some of those who affect to think lightly of it are indebted to it for much more than the \"names of many of those who have written on this subject.\"\n\nMuch about this time, but in what precise year we cannot say, the abb\u00e9 Rozier, well known as the editor of the early volumes of the Journal de Physique, published his Cours d'Agriculture et de Medecine Veterinaire; a work of much reputation in France, but, we believe little known on this side the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>.\n\nAnother work appeared about this time on the epidemics among cattle, entitled Recherches Historiques et Physiques sur les Maladies Epizootiques; \"Historical and Philosophical Researches respecting Epizootic Diseases,\" by M. Paulet. It contains an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ABRIDGMENT\">abridgment</a> of almost all that had been written on the subject, and is particularly valuable for the account of the morbid appearances that were discovered on dissection.\n\nWe shall finish our account of French writers in the words of Mr Blaine.\n\n\"After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Bourgelat and Lafoffe, we hear Huzard of no character of any great eminence for some years; but it appears, that since the revolution, the subject has again been more diligently studied, and the names of Chabert and Huzard stand forward. Soon after, or about the time above alluded to, there appeared a considerable work, called, The Rational Dictionary of Medicine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURGERY\">Surgery</a>, and Farriery, in five volumes; and very soon after, a Veterinary Dictionary, by Buchon; but it has no merit superior to that of Lafoffe. In 1787, M. Chabert published a Treatise on the Mange of Horses; since which he has likewise published upon the peripneumonia of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> cattle. There has also appeared an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on the Grease of Horses, which gained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> medal of the society for the promoting the health of animals; to which is joined a report on thick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> and on broken wind; but we are not aware who is the author. In 1788, there came out a treatise on the haras, with the method of hoeing, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a>, and all the lesser operations, translated from the Spanish of Hartmann, by Huzard. Likewise \"Instructions and Observations on Domestic Animals, with remarks on the breeding, rearing, buying and selling; with an analysis of previous authors, by Chabert, Handrin, and Huzard. The above authors have also published, conjointly, a Veterinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALMANACK\">Almanack</a>, containing the history and progress of animal medicine, since the establishment of the veterinary schools. In 1791, M. Lamagieu Lapole, veterinary surgeon, published observations on the health of the animals of St Domingo, dedicated to the veterinary college at Alfort. In 1797, M. Chabert and Oudinet, M. Huzard published, by order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, a treatise vol i., on ascertaining the existence of the glanders, the means of preventing it, and destroying the infection.\"\n\nBefore we detail what has been done in Britain for the advancement of the art, we must take a cursory view.\nview of the principal writings that appeared during the 18th century in the rest of Europe.\n\nIn 1730, Goelicke, a German, published a treatise in 4to, *De Lue Contagiosa a Bovium*; \"On the Contagious Disease of Cattle;\" in which the symptoms of the murrain that raged in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a> about that time are well described; and there are added the appearances on diffusion.\n\nIn 1734, appeared at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAGUE\">Hague</a> a work entitled *La parfaite Connoissance des Chevaux*; \"The Complete Knowledge of Horses;\" by John Saunier, and Galpard his son. The latter boasts of this work, that it was drawn up from the lectures of his father, an experienced man; and that it contains the result of numerous experiments on subjects of every description, and diseases of every species; that it is the labour of the life of two men, the offspring of their continual application and study. After all their boasting, however, the work of Mynheers Saunier is little worth.\n\nIn 1745, and 1746, appeared two other treatises on the epidemic of cattle by Mauchard and Ens.\n\nIn 1749, the illustrious and indefatigable Linn\u00e9 published at Upsal his *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAN\">Pan</a> Suecicus*, in which there is little that relates to our subject, if we except a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> as are eaten or refused by the domestic animals, which is curious and useful.\n\nSome time before 1756, Frederic Hafler, a Swede, published *Instructions for Improving the Breed of Sheep*, which was in much repute, and was translated into French.\n\nIn 1762, M. Reynier of Laufane published a treatise on a contagious inflammatory disorder that raged among horses and cattle, and which the Geneveese called *la louver*. This will be considered hereafter.\n\nIn the same year there appeared at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a> a work on the epidemic of cattle by Dr Plenitz; and in 1765 Mich. Sagard of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> published a work on a contagious distemper that the year before attacked the cattle in the circle of Iglaw in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORAVIA\">Moravia</a>; and was attended with an appearance of aphthous crusts in the mouth.\n\nOf late veterinary medicine has been much cultivated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, where the works of Hartmann are held in much esteem. In that country, it is said, a work on farriery in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> volumes has been lately published; but of this we know nothing.\n\nWe must not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> our account of continental writers without mentioning the name of the illustrious Camper, whose works were lately collected and published at Paris. Besides a long description of the structure of the organs, and some lesser essays on comparative anatomy, these volumes contain an elaborate history of the epizootic disease that raged among the cattle on the continent in the middle of last century, in the form of lectures. We shall speak of this work hereafter.\n\nWe have thus brought the history of this art on the continent in a concise manner, down to the present time; and from it may be learned what improvements have originated there, and at what periods. It would appear, that when the science began to command attention, from the exertions of Francis the first, and Vegetius became studied, had it progressively improved in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> it might be supposed to be placed by a conversation with this author, it would ere this have been more approximating to perfection; but instead of proceeding on the rational system of Vegetius, it dwindled again into ignorance of barbarity; and the recipes of manage-masters, and the operations of blacksmiths, were the only ostensible marks of its affluence. From this state the practitioner became in some degree routed by the improved system of Solleyfel; but he could only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> present errors, he could not point the way to future improvement, for he was ignorant of the groundwork whereon to build it, i.e. the anatomy of the animal. This defect was only in a small degree supplied by the labours of Ruini, and in some measure farther assisted by the demonstrations of Bourgelat. Many of the remaining errors were combated by Lafoffe with great advantage; and his experiments and discoveries on glanders, the rationality and improvements of his mode of shoeing, entitle him to great merit. Yet, though by these exertions, and by the establishment of veterinary seminaries, the art assumed a more regular and scientific form, its attainments were by no means adequate to its opportunities; which was almost wholly owing to an obstinate adherence to the humoral pathology, by which the treatment of internal and acute diseases <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> inert and unsuccessful. Their prescriptions were filled with decoctions of simples, and they were utterly unacquainted with the medicinal virtues of the more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> remedies in use among us. Under an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that the blood and humours were the constant seat of disease, they were continually wasting them with correctors; entirely ignorant or unmindful of the derangements of the solids, and of the connections between living blood and living vessels. Nor did this influence only their treatment of internal and acute diseases; but even of local and chronic affections: hence their mode of treating farcy, gout, and other complaints of a similar nature, were equally inert, and all evinced an erroneous pathology. Upon a careful and unprejudiced review of the state of farriery among ourselves, and on the continent of Europe, we are not inclined to think it had any advantages of moment at the beginning of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> in their favour; though it must be allowed, we are indebted to them for many improvements, and for the first hints towards the establishment of a regular school of the art among us. Since the war, our means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> are so few, that we are not aware of what is doing among our neighbours. But though farriery, as a branch of veterinary medicine here, has kept nearly equal pace with its continental improvements, I do not think (says Mr Blaine,) the treatment of other animals, particularly of oxen, cows, and sheep, has been equally attended to; and, in this particular, I am disposed to think we are behind hand with them. Their severe visitations of the epizootic distemper have made them more attentive to this branch of the art.\"\n\nIn taking a view of the history of farriery, or veterinary medicine in general, in our own country, it will be seen, that we were much longer in improving the art, and reducing it under a rational and scientific form, than our neighbours on the continent. Our earliest writers on the diseases of horses and cattle, were deplorably ignorant, not only of all principles of general medicine and found practice, but even frequently of the common appearances of the diseases, which they professed to cure.\n\nOur first writers on the treatment of the diseases of Blundelhorses, ville,\nPart I.","sp":23,"ep":31},{"h":"PROVIDED THE PROPER","t":"d the proper means be taken in the early stage of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, the inflammation is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> soon removed; but when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLINE\">crystalline</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> becomes opaque, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means hitherto employed have, as we shall presently see, produced any benefit.\n\nIn the treatment of this affection, it must be remembered, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> is deranged, and that our remedies must therefore not be confined to local applications to the eye. General blood-letting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> almost always be required; but, unless the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> is very fat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> plethoric, this need not be repeated. It will be proper also to apply a blister or two to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, as near the eye as possible, and the veins at the corners of the eye should be opened, to draw blood from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>. The horse must be put on lower diet, and should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> only very moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>; the stable should be kept well aired and cool; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the horse's eyes are very sensitive, and the stable happen to have windows, these should be darkened. It will generally be advisable to give a purgative medicine; and the horse may drink frequently of some cooling liquor, especially of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, with nitre dissolved in it. Rowels have been sometimes recommended; and it is said that considerable benefit has\nPart VI.\n\nFAR R I E R Y.\n\nDiseases has followed the insertion of fetons as near the eye as possible.

As there is generally considerable dryness of the skin in this complaint, it may be useful in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> to administer a gentle sudorific, such as a solution of two drachms of emetic tartar, or No. 22. of the receipts may be given.\n\nWith respect to the applications to the eye itself, those which appear the most likely to be of advantage, are stimulating substances, such as tincture of opium, solution of blue vitriol, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> precipitate in the form of a soft ointment, such as No. 40. Sometimes, however, these stimulating applications do harm; and it is found that a weak solution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, or acetate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a>, as prescribed in No. 31., are most useful. We must here take notice of an absurd practice that is in use among <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> farriers, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> away the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, which they consider as a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> part of the complaint. There is no doubt, however, that relief may have been procured by this operation, as it will generally be attended with a pretty copious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of blood, that will relieve the distended vessels; but as this effusion can be more easily produced by clarifying the red vessels of the white of the eye; and, by opening the angular veins, there is no occasion to take away a part, which is certainly of considerable use to the animal.\n\nSheep are sometimes affected with inflammation of the eye; but in them, as in most other animals, it is merely a local disease, and is generally relieved by topical bleeding. In the corrected agricultural report of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERTH\">Perth</a>, it is stated, that the common practice in that district for relieving inflammation in the eyes of sheep is, to open the veins in the corner of the eye, and hold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the animal's head, so as to allow the blood to get within the eye. There is no doubt that this bleeding does good; and the introduction of the blood within the eye may, we believe, also be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>; not, however, in the way supposed by the reporter, but because it acts as a gentle stimulus.\n\nWe have already, in No. 324., made some observations on catarrh, and noticed the inefficacy of all the usual methods of treatment. It may not be improper here to add the result of Mr. Coleman's experimental attempts to relieve this complaint, as stated by Mr. Feron.\n\n\"The professor has begun with bleeding from the jugular or angular veins, and, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, employing purgatives frequently repeated, as well as diuretics administered one after another. After which he has tried all the medicines of Mr. Phipps and Wathen, but without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of permanent success. The local and surgical treatment has been as follows, viz.\n\n\"1st, He has ordered scarifications, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> a feton through the membrana conjunctiva; but without effect.\n\n\"2ndly, We have removed some of the larger vessels going to the cornea, and divided them with the actual cautery, but with no success.\n\n\"3rdly, We have applied leeches to the conjunctiva, but without effect.\n\n\"Lastly, We have taken up both carotid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTERIES\">arteries</a>, which was of no avail, from the anastomoses, which the vertebral arteries form with them.\n\n\"Therefore, the treatment is confined entirely to Diseases, bleeding, purging, and diuretics; fomentations of warm water, in order to diminish the irritation from the tears that run over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a>; and plenty of moderate and continual exercise, so as to increase the perspiration.\"\n\n3. CATARRH. Catarrhus. Mor Foundering, or Common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">Cold</a>.\n\nCatarrh has been placed by Dr. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a> among the Catarrh, or profusivus, or fluxes attended with fever; we have ventured, with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> authors, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> it as an inflammation, because the increased secretion of mucus, which might entitle it to be called a profusivum, though sometimes pretty considerable, is not a constant, or often a very remarkable symptom of the disease; and in all cases appears to be the effect of an inflammatory state of the pituitary membrane. There are generally reckoned two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of catarrh, simple cold, and epidemic catarrh, or influenza. Though in the latter of these the catarrh is probably only symptomatic, we shall, in compliance with the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, consider it immediately after common catarrh.\n\nThis disease attacks all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> animals; but horses and dogs are most liable to it, and in them the symptoms are most severe. It usually commences by a general dullness and heaviness, a dryness and increased redness of the inside of the nostrils, from which there soon proceeds an unusual secretion of mucus; a dryness of the eyes, or sometimes an increased effusion of tears. In a short time there is generally added some degree of cough and difficulty of breathing; and sometimes there is with these symptoms a considerable degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and dryness of the skin; increased thirst, and not unfrequently a loss of appetite. At first the cough is dry, and sometimes continues so; but more frequently, when the complaint has remained for some time, a frothy whitish mucus is coughed up. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> is not always much affected in this disease; but in general it is fuller and harder than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a>. The first symptom of the disease is not unfrequently a chilliness and trembling.\n\nThe principal causes of catarrh in domestic animals, as well as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, are sudden changes of temperature, especially cold applied when the body is in a state of perspiration, or entering a warm apartment after having been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> exposed to a cold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. Drinking cold water, when sweating, is also a common cause; and these causes are the more likely to produce their effect when the animal is in a plethoric state.\n\nIf neglected, catarrh may go on to inflammation of the lungs; in the horse it may produce thick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, or even broken wind; in cattle it may end in chronic cough; and in sheep it may lay the foundation of consumption or pulmonic rot. It is also not unfrequently followed by the complaint called glanders, which we are presently to describe. An improper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of treatment, especially giving cordials and other hot medicines, will hasten on these terminations of the disease. If attended to in time, and if the proper mode of treatment be adopted, the symptoms are, in general, soon removed.\n\nIf the complaint is slight, and there is little fever, it will often be sufficient to take the animal within doors into a warm stable, give him a warm bath, and put a cloth over him, when he will perspire through the night,\nDiseases, night, and be nearly well next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> will also answer, if it be adopted immediately, on perceiving the chilliness or shivering. If, however, considerable fever has taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and the animal's pulse is hard, it will be proper to draw blood, according to the urgency of the symptoms, before giving any internal remedy, or using warm clothing. After bleeding, a drench, composed of warm ale, with a drachm or two of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> of hartshorn, or half an ounce of spirit of hartshorn sweetened with molasses, will prove an excellent remedy; after taking which, the animal should be well rubbed down, and clothed as before. If the animal is coughing, back-raking, followed by clysters, will be advisable; and throughout the treatment coughs must be avoided. If there is considerable fever, the drench, No. 22, or 26, where coughs is to be obviated, should be given every four hours. Some practitioners advise balls in these cases, as in most others; but as there is often some swelling of the throat, and always considerable irritation about the faucets, it is better to give the remedies in the form of drenches. The cough seldom needs particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> during the inflammatory state of the disease, as it will generally go off when the inflammation is removed; if it should continue obstinate, it becomes a chronic cough, and must be treated as directed under No. 436.\n\n4. Influenza, or Epidemic Catarrh.\n\nThe epidemic catarrh also affects all these animals, and has sometimes been known to attack a whole yard of oxen, horses, and cows, in one night. It differs from common catarrh in the degree of fever, which, in this complaint, is always very considerable, and is one of the first symptoms. There is a smart shivering, followed by considerable heat and dryness of the skin, and the fever is commonly attended with great heaviness and pain of the head, and affection of the eyes. In this complaint there is also a great degree of weakness, which comes on pretty early in the disease, and this weakness not unfrequently brings on a fatal termination of the disease. Sometimes there is a considerable discharge from the nostrils; at others this discharge is either trifling, or the nostrils are dry, in which cases the fever is most considerable.\n\nThe epidemic catarrh appears to depend on some peculiar state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>; but there is no doubt that it is capable of being propagated by contagion. It is more prevalent in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, especially when this has been preceded by a mild winter. It is said, that when cattle are at these times exposed to currents of air from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-east, they are most likely to be affected with it.\n\nIn the commencement of this disease, it will be proper to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> the animals; but too much warmth must be avoided, as it would tend to increase the weakness that forms a principal part of the disease. It may sometimes be necessary, when the fever runs very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, to draw blood once; and, at any rate, it will be proper to apply a blister to the head, or on each side of the neck. Though warmth must be avoided, great care should be taken not to expose the animals to a draught of air. Warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a> may be given as in common catarrh, but when the fever has subsided, cordials and strengthening remedies will be required; and if the appetite is tolerably good, the diet may be more nourishing than usual. The animals should on no account be hard worked, but be allowed to rest from the time the disease is first noticed, except taking gentle exercise when their strength will admit of it.\n\nWhat is commonly called the distemper in dogs is now pretty generally considered as a sort of epidemic or contagious catarrh. We shall therefore treat of it in this place.\n\n5. Of the Distemper in Dogs.\n\nNo disorder is more general among dogs, than that distemper which is generally known by the name of the distemper in dogs, and none is so destructive. It is asserted that, except the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>, no disease is so fatal to the animal which it attacks.\n\nIt appears that this disorder has not been known in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, till within the last 50 years, but, during that time, it is astonishing what numbers of dogs have fallen victims to it. For these last fifteen or twenty years, however, the distemper has been less frequent, and has assumed a milder form.\n\nThe symptoms of the distemper are not alike in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. The following are, according to Mr. Blaine, its usual appearances. It generally begins with a dry husky cough, attended with dulness and want of appetite, a running from the eyes and nose, and loss of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>. As the disease advances, the dog appears much emaciated, and grows excessively weak, particularly in the loins and hind legs. Convulsive twitchings of different parts, especially of the head, come on, attended with dimness of sight; and, as the disease proceeds, and puts on a more virulent form, these twitchings degenerate into strong convulsive fits, which continue for a long time, and repeatedly return. In these fits, the dog foams at the mouth, runs round, and appears to be in great pain, and to have a constant desire to dung. This is sometimes attended with obstinate coughing, at others with violent purging. The stomach is extremely irritable; every thing that the animal takes being immediately thrown up. When the disease has reached this state, the animal seldom recovers, and is usually carried off in one of the convulsive fits.\n\nIn every part of this disease there prevails a want of energy, and a particular paralytic affection of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a>. This latter symptom, in some instances, remains long after the disease has been otherwise removed; but, in general, the strength returns almost immediately on the removal of the other symptoms.\n\nThe distemper in its worst form is often mistaken for canine madness; but they may in general be distinguished, by attending to the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>.\n\n1st. The distemper seldom occurs except in puppies, its most common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> being from six to twelve months. Madness may occur at any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, but seldom attacks puppies.\n\n2nd. In the distemper dogs drink freely; in madness, though they often attempt to drink, it does not appear that they are capable of swallowing the water.\n\n3rd. In the distemper the animal does not attempt to bite; but, in madness, the propensity to biting seems to be incessant.\n\n4th. In madness there appears to be a loss of reason at all times, though, as is said, they are so sensible, as to know their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>; but, in the distemper, though there is sometimes a loss of reason, it lasts no longer\nIf, therefore, a young dog will drink, as soon as the effect of the convulsion is removed, but more particularly when his weakness is excessive, and strongly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> in the intervals between the fits, it may be pretty safely concluded, that he is affected with the distemper, and not with madness. These circumstances, says Mr Blaine, should be carefully remarked, as they are unerring, and may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> many a valuable animal from destruction, and many a timid mind from the most dreadful apprehensions.\n\nThe cause of the distemper is difficult to explain; nor do the most careful observations, in every stage of the complaint, ascertain more than that there is a general inflammation of the mucous membrane; but whether the true seat of the disease is confined to that membrane, and all the other symptoms are the consequences of it, or are real affections of other parts, is an undecided point, although, it is certain that its first appearance is by an inflammation of the pituitary membrane, and which is one of most lasting, as well as constant symptoms. That this inflammation is given from the membrane of the nose, to the upper part of the gullet and wind-pipe, is evident by the swelling of the glands of the throat, the tenderness and dry cough; and that this inflammation extends from thence to the same membrane of the stomach and intestines, is equally so, producing vomiting, coliciveness, or purging. It has generally, as we have said, been considered as a species of catarrh; but it has been suggested to us, by an ingenious friend, that, from several symptoms, as well as from its attacking dogs only once in their lives, it is more analogous to pertussis, or crouphia, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> subject.\n\nWith respect to the cure of the distemper, Mr Blaine's directions and remedies appear to have been tolerably successful. With the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of his remedy we are unacquainted, but believe it to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>. This medicine has been made known by extensively advertising it, and although certificates of its utility are numerous, they make no part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVERTISEMENT\">advertisement</a>, but are to be seen at Mr Boofey's, in Old Bond Street, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, the wholesale <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>; the form is a powder. Explicit instructions accompany it; and the price, considered with its asserted efficacy, bears no proportion, as no sportman would think five times the sum too much for the preservation of a valuable animal. Although so efficacious, it is nevertheless innocent enough for a child to take; nor must those who are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> for strong remedies imagine, that, because the effects of this shake not the whole constitution, that the disease will not be eradicated by it. When the disorder is strong, after it is given, there is for the most part a gradual decrease of the symptoms, and nothing but a small moisture at the nose remains, which speedily disappears the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. If the attack is flight, no more is seen of it, and the animal is at once well.\n\nFrom the varieties in the size, and consequent strength of dogs, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of the medicine is necessary; the packets are therefore marked 1, 2, and 3. For a mastiff, pointer, fetter, or dog of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> size, No. 1, should be procured. Hounds, spaniels, and those of a middling size, require No. 2; and all the lesser dogs, No. 3.\n\nIt has been already observed, that, in the severity of the disorder, there is frequently so great an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a> of the stomach, that every thing taken into it is instantly thrown up; in such cases, the powder should be carefully mixed with a small piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, at the same time adding to it thirty, forty, or fifty drops of laudanum, according to the age, size, and strength of the dog; who is to be watched, whether the medicine is retained, and kept as still as possible; but should it be thrown up, notwithstanding this addition, in two hours after the same quantity of laudanum should be given without the powder, in a little broth or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, and half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> afterwards the powder mixed into a paste with treacle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>, or flour, and thus the vomiting will be prevented. Should there be at the same time obstinate coliciveness, it is probable that sicknesses may be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of it, and must be removed before it will cease; twenty grains of jalap, or, in preference, fifteen grains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALOMEL\">calomel</a>, with four or five drops of laudanum, may be given in a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>; or two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>-spoonfuls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASTOR\">castor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> may, if more convenient, be used. Should these not stay on the stomach, a clyster with milk, salt, and oil, seldom fails to remove the coliciveness, after which the powder should be given, if there has been great sicknesses, with the laudanum; if not, without it.\n\nWhen, likewise, extensive purging accompanies the complaint, the laudanum should not be omitted; as by running off rapidly by stool, the effect of the medicine is equally lost, as if it were vomited up. In such case it will be proper to give before the powder thirty or forty drops of laudanum, with two ounces of olive oil. We should always attempt to remove the sickness and purging, or coliciveness, before administering the powder, as the effect of this will be then more certain. In the milder form of the disease, however, nothing is requisite but to give the powder in such a way, as that the dog may take the whole of it; for which purpose the powder should be well mixed with a small quantity of any thing that the dog will eat, or, if he is averse to eating, it should be made up into a small ball with honey, treacle, or butter, and forced down his throat. It must not be mixed with any liquid, as it is so heavy that it would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to the bottom, and thus will probably be lost. Care should be taken to give the medicine on an empty stomach, as the effect will otherwise be lessened or destroyed; and the dog should be carefully watched to see if the medicine be thrown up, as, if this is the case, or if there is reason to suppose that the whole dose is not given, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> should be administered. Mr Blaine concludes with observing, that the symptoms remove without any particular appearance; yet so quickly, as that there is seldom any remains of the disease two hours after the medicines have been administered.\n\nMr Daniel has witnessed the extraordinary effects in the distemper, from Dr James's powder, given in the following manner. When the symptoms of the distemper are apparent, a third part of one of the parcels inclosed in the half-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> packets is to be given, mixed with a little butter, and the dog is to have plenty of warm broth, or milk and water, and, if possible, he is to be near a fire, or at least kept very warm. Two hours afterwards another third part is to be administered; and, should neither of these operate by vomiting or purging,\nat the end of four hours, give the remaining third. Should the two first portions have the effect, the remaining third should not be given until four or six hours (according to the evacuations) after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> of the four hours; in the interim the dog is to be encouraged to lap, and if he refuses, be forced to take plentifully of warm broth, or milk and water. Very seldom, even when the case is invertebrate, but the evacuations are brought on by the taking of one packet, generally by the second dose; but should it happen that there is no such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the powder's effect, the second parcel should be divided into similar proportions, and applied in the same manner, until the stomach is emptied. Warmth and warm liquids will quickly perfect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a>. As soon as the dog's appetite returns, let him be fed (at first rather sparingly) with animal food.\n\nDr Darwin advises, that the dog be permitted to go about freely in the open air, and have constant access to fresh water. The use of being as much as may be in the air is evident, because all the air which we breathe passes twice over the putrid floggs of the mortified parts of the membrane which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> the nostrils, and the maxillary and frontal cavities; that is, both during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a> and expiration, and must therefore be loaded with contagious particles. Fresh new milk and fresh broth should be given them very frequently, and they should be suffered to go amongst the grass, which they sometimes eat for the purpose of an emetic, and, if possible, should have access to a running stream of water, as the contagious mucus of the nostrils, both of these animals and horses, generally drops into the water when they attempt to drink. Bits of raw flesh, if the dog will eat them, are preferred to cooked meat; and from five to ten drops of opium may be given with advantage, when symptoms of debility are evident, according to the size of the dog, every six hours. If flogs can be seen in the nostrils, they should be moistened twice a day, with a solution of sugar of lead, or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>, by means of a sponge fixed on a bit of whalebone, or by a syringe. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOTION\">lotion</a> may be made by dissolving half an ounce of sugar of lead in a pint of water.\n\n6. RHEUMATISM.\n\nThere seems no doubt that horses, and perhaps cattle, are affected with rheumatism, but it is sometimes difficult to ascertain the presence of the complaint, or to distinguish it from other causes that produce lameness. It may take place in any of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, but it is more frequently observed to affect the hip-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> and the adjacent membranes; and when seated here, it is called the feia-tica, and sometimes the hip-gout. It will require considerable judgment to distinguish this complaint; but it may generally be known by attentively examining the limb in which the lameness is seated, from the hip down to the foot, and by attending to the canes that seem likely to have produced the lameness. In rheumatism the skin will be found dry, and the affected part swollen, and the lameness attendant on it will be more readily removed by exercise than that which has its cause seated in the foot, or which arises from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONY\">bony</a> excrescences. Rheumatism in the horse, as in the human subject, may be either acute or chronic, and the latter is the most obstinate.\n\nRheumatism, like catarrh, is produced by sudden changes of temperature, and by exposure to a cold moist atmosphere. It is no otherwise dangerous than as it renders the animal lame.\n\nThe cure of rheumatism differs according to its state. In the acute one bleeding may be proper; after which a warm bath, with two drachms of emetic tartar dissolved in the water, should be given, and the horse treated as directed under catarrh. If a sweat is produced, and kept up for some hours, the complaint will probably disappear, and its return may be prevented by frequent friction of the affected part, regular exercise, a nourishing diet, and attention to avoid changes of temperature. In the chronic rheumatism, bleeding will be improper; and the most likely means of relief will be, to rub the affected parts several times a day with some stimulating liniment, or, if convenient, to use the warm bath for a considerable time together, or to foment the affected limb for an hour or two every night, after which the limb must be rubbed perfectly dry. Pretty constant exercise will also contribute greatly to the cure, and coltiveness must be avoided. A blister applied over the affected part will sometimes do good. According to Mr Lawrence, the only cure to be depended on is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>'s run of salt marshes in the spring, and being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> abroad in some shady place till autumn, afterwards mercurial physic, and the best stable care.\n\n7. INFLAMMATION OF THE LUNGS. Pleuritis. Peripneumonia. Pleurify. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIPNEUMONY\">Peripneumony</a>. Rising of the Lights. Rot.\n\nThe lungs are frequently inflamed in the domestic animals; and, as in man, the inflammation may be seated in either in the membrane covering the lungs and lining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>, or the pleura, or in the substance of the lungs, constituting the two varieties, pleurify and peripneumony.\n\nThe disease has been called by common farriers, rising of the lights, from an idea that the lungs protruded against the throat, and caused that difficulty of breathing which is one of the principal symptoms of this complaint. The other vulgar appellation of rot seems to owe its origin to the appearance which the lungs sometimes present on dissection, being found in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a>, and partial decomposition, as if they were rotten. It is of little consequence to distinguish the two varieties of the disease, as the treatment is the same in both.\n\nAccording to Mr Feron, the symptoms of inflammation of the lungs in the horse are invariably as follow. The respiration is quick, the breath hot, the extremities cold, the tongue dry and hot, the flanks heaving, the patient never lying down, which forms a very characteristic symptom; and sometimes he hangs down his head. If nothing has been done, it is hardly possible to save his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, after three days have elapsed; and, after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> side of the heart is found to have been inflamed, and, on some occasions, so much distended with blood as actually to burst, and the lungs are found to resemble putrid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a>, the cells filled with blood, from the great distention of the pulmonary arteries, and perhaps sometimes effusions take place; the pulse is oppressed, from the great distention occasioned by the blood in the right side of the heart, while the left side of that organ is weak, from want of sufficient blood.\n\nTo Mr Feron's account it may be added, that the pulse,\npulse, at the commencement of the disease, is generally more full, harder, and more frequent than natural; but, as soon as the disease reaches the stage at which it is usually first observed, the pulse has become small and oppressed, and but little increased in frequency; the veins of the neck are swollen and prominent, and the eyes are generally red and starting. There is sometimes cough, at others none; but the difficulty of breathing is always great, and the horse stands extended, panting for breath, with heaving flanks and open nostrils, till, no longer able to support himself, he drops down and dies. This fatal termination sometimes takes place in a very short period; in 48, 36, or even 24 hours.\n\nThe only disease with which this can easily be confused, is colic; and the discriminating marks will be mentioned when we treat of this disease. At present it will be sufficient to remark, that when a horse appears dull, holds his head very low, breathes with difficulty, especially during inspiration, stands constantly, has a quick heaving of the flanks, a fullness of the eyes, and redness of the inside of the nostrils, and when the pulse is small and oppressed, he may almost certainly be declared affected with inflammation of the lungs.\n\nIt may not be improper to give a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> explanation of the symptoms which we have enumerated; and they are chiefly to be explained from the difficulty with which the blood passes through the lungs, on account of the unusual accumulation in the pulmonary vessels. Hence the difficulty of breathing, and the aversion that the horse expresses to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> down; for it is evident, that he will breathe more easily in a standing posture than if he were lying; because, as was remarked in the table of the extremities of the muscles, some of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> on the chest, when the fore legs are fixed, and thus assist in carrying forward the ribs, and thus increasing the cavity of the chest. The impeded passage of the blood through the lungs also explains why the pulse is weak and oppressed; and hence, when this obstruction is relieved by lessening the quantity of blood, the pulse never fails to become stronger and fuller.\n\nThe causes of inflammation of the lungs are doubtless sudden changes of temperature, especially when the animal is plethoric; it is probable that the most common cause is a sudden change from heat to cold and moisture. It is at present, however, more fashionable to consider the reverse of this as the general cause of pulmonary complaints; and we understand that Mr Coleman goes so far as to say, that horses are never attacked with inflammation of the lungs from exposure to simple cold, for, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> of horses to graze without preparation, though it may render them emaciated, seldom produces the complaint in question. Mr Feron also, who may be considered as a pupil of the veterinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that inflammation of the internal viscera proceeds from a sudden transition from a cold to a hot temperature, but seldom or never from a hot to a cold one. We are aware that these gentlemen have borrowed their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> from Dr Beddoes, and it is of little consequence to our present purpose, whether it be correct or not.\n\nThe judgment to be formed with respect to the termination of this disease, which is always highly dangerous, will depend on the urgency of the symptoms, and on the changes that take place after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of the usual remedies. If the pulse becomes fuller and stronger after bleeding; if the breathing becomes less difficult; if the parts where blisters have been laid inflame soon, and the blisters rise well; and, in particular, if the horse lies down, and seems less distressed, we may hope that the danger is lessened; and if these favourable signs continue for 24 hours, we may consider a cure as pretty certain: but, if the pulse still continues small and oppressed, more especially, if it becomes quick and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>; if the difficulty of breathing continues or increases; if there is a rattling in the throat, with partial cold sweats and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> dejection; a fatal termination must be looked for, which will speedily take place, if the breath becomes cold or fetid. It is considered as a very unfavourable symptom when the horse appears insensible to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> stimuli; as when blisters do not rise well, nor rows easily suppurate.\n\nIn the cure of inflammation of the lungs, everything will depend on the speedy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of the most vigorous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, and the first and principal remedy is bleeding. This should be performed as soon as possible, and to a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> than in most inflammatory diseases. It will scarcely be proper to take less than five or perhaps six quarts at first, and the bleeding must be repeated, though less copiously, some hours after, if a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMISSION\">remission</a> of the symptoms does not take place. It must not be expected that the pulse will rise much after a second or third bleeding; but, if it is not considerably weakened, and if the oppressed feel of it is removed, we may be sure that the bleeding has not been carried too far. Another principal means of checking the internal inflammation is, to excite an inflammation externally near the seat of the complaint, by every means in our power. A large blister should be applied on each side of the chest, and to the inside of the fore legs; a rowel should be inserted below the chest, and if the symptoms are very urgent, another near the belly. Mr Coleman recommends inflating the cellular membrane below the skin with air, so as to bring on an inflammation between the skin and muscles; and if this does not succeed, he advises that some stimulating fluid, such as oil of turpentine, be injected. We should suppose this carrying inflammation rather too near the lungs; but from some trials that Mr Coleman has made, and some others of Mr Feron, this method seems to have been attended with considerable advantage. In addition to these means, the fore legs should be well rubbed two or three times a day with oil of turpentine, or the liniment in No. 42. of the receipts. These are the external means that are chiefly to be relied on; and if these be followed up speedily, and with proper attention, there will seldom be any occasion for internal remedies. If these be given, they must be such as are calculated to cool the body, and check inflammation, such as the drenches No. 22. and 26. especially the latter, as it is necessary to keep the bowels open. Perhaps foxglove might here be given with advantage, as directed under that article, at 290. Mr Feron recommends diuretics, and a ball composed of an ounce and half of emetic tartar, a drachm of opium, and 15 or 20 grains of calomel. We do not know whether this is the practice of the veterinary college, but it appears to us to be inconsistent with the bleeding and other evacuants which are generally found most successful. As cottivenes would tend to increase the inflammatory symptoms, back-raking and the occasional use of mild clysters,\nclysters, will be requisite. In general, warm water, or this with a little Glauber salt dissolved in it, will be sufficient, as all heating purgatives would do harm. The horse should be kept rather warm, should be clothed, and should drink frequently of warm gruel. Food will not be requisite, and, if set before him, he would probably not touch it. Exercise of every kind must be avoided, at least so long as the inflammatory symptoms continue.\n\nThe most favourable termination of this complaint is by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>, when the inflammatory symptoms go off without producing suppuration or ulceration of the lungs; but sometimes this state is unavoidable, an ulcer is produced, and, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> is not thrown off, it may either produce suffocation, or bring on hectic fever and consumption. When it is found that a cough remains after the inflammation has subsided, and a quantity of mucus is thrown off, the evacuation of this should be promoted by gentle expectorants, and the horse must still be kept warm. Though the matter may be completely expectorated, there will generally remain a difficulty of breathing, or thick wind, when inflammation of the lungs terminates by suppuration. Sometimes there is left an anaerobic or droptical state of the lungs, and in these cases it is said that blue vitriol and turpentine, to the amount of two drachms of each, mixed into a ball, with a proper quantity of linseed powder, and given every morning, have been beneficial. It may also be proper to apply a blister over the wind-pipe.\n\nInflammation of the lungs in cattle differs little in symptoms, and nothing in the treatment, from that which we have been describing in the horse.\n\nThe lungs of sheep are very frequently affected with inflammation, which forms one of the diseases that has been confounded under the name of rot. It most frequently attacks young sheep, especially those of the more delicate breeds; and it is most prevalent in damp pastures, and during unfavourable seasons. The symptoms of this disease in sheep have not been well described, but they probably differ from those in horses and cattle, only in degree. It does not appear to be so speedily fatal, although the animals seldom or never recover from it. Towards the latter stage of the disease there is considerable weakness; and at this time there appears below the jaw an oedematous swelling, containing a quantity of fluid, which is easily evacuated by piercing the tumour. This tumour is called the pock in Scotland. On opening the bodies of sheep that have died of this species of rot, the lungs are found full of knots or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUBERCLES\">tubercles</a>, similar to those which appear in human subjects that have died of pulmonary consumption, and sometimes the lungs appear mortified or rotten. The liver, however, in these cases is found, which distinguishes this variety from the other diseases called rot.\n\nWe do not know that this disease admits of a cure in sheep, though it might probably be prevented by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSING\">housing</a> them, or affording them shelter, at those seasons when it is most likely to occur.\n\nInflammation of the lungs occurs sometimes in dogs, but it does not seem to be very frequent in these animals. It requires pretty much the same treatment as in the horse, except that here emetic tartar may be given in such a quantity as to excite considerable sickness, without vomiting. This would be improper in the horse, as it would be difficult to regulate the dose of the medicine, so as not to produce such an irritation of the stomach as might considerably increase the animal's distress, and augment the difficulty of breathing.\n\n8. Inflammation of the Liver. Hepatitis.\n\nWe have no doubt that inflammation of the liver takes place occasionally in most of our domestic animals; and it is probably a more frequent disease than is generally supposed. Both species of it, viz. the acute and chronic, may appear in these animals, and it will appear presently, that the latter is a very common disease among sheep. Though dissection has clearly shewn, that the liver in cows, horses, and sheep, has been affected with inflammation during the life of the animal, yet any account of the symptoms of this disease that is given us by the veterinary writers, is so obscure, that we cannot pretend to give anything like a perspicuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>.\n\nAccording to Mr Blaine, this disease, considered as a distinct affection, is seldom met with in the horse, though, when great abdominal inflammation exists, the liver often partakes of the general disease. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the symptoms, this author <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> that it is usually accompanied with coliciveness, for the gland ceases to secrete the bile from its being in an inflamed state; and that bile which was secreted, is not poured into the intestine, but becomes depolished in the skin, producing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JAUNDICE\">jaundice</a>, which is known by the yellowness of the eyes and the tongue. The pulse is generally full, hard, and frequent, but the pain not very intense. It would be difficult to detect it, unless by the symptoms of fever, accompanied with yellowness of the mouth and eyes. There would possibly be pain in the shoulder as in the human, in which case the horse might on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> be found lame.\n\nIt is easy to see, that this description is a fanciful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of the disease, drawn from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> that the author supposes to exist between inflammation of the liver in man and the same disease in horses; and it is probably not to be depended upon.\n\nThe writers on cattle medicine describe the symptoms of the disease in cattle to be a difficulty of breathing, evident marks of fever, yellowness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>, a swelling about the short ribs, and an unusual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> about the barren or womb. Here the symptoms of an acute and chronic distemper seem to be confounded.\n\nAs for the symptoms of the disease in sheep, in whom it forms one of the varieties of rot, we have seen no ac-in sheep. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> of them any further than as they are confounded with those of the other varieties of rot, and, as such, they will be noticed when we come to treat of the rot in general. If this disease could be detected in its acute state, the cure would probably not be difficult; but when it appears in the chronic form, it is, we believe, seldom removed.\n\nWhen the bodies of such animals as have died of inflammation of the liver are opened, the liver has been found in various states of disease; sometimes it is harder and firmer than usual, and very frequently there are parts of it that are scirrhouss and discoloured, resisting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a> when we attempt to cut through them. Sometimes the biliary ducts are almost bony, and there is commonly found in them, and sometimes in other parts of the liver, a species of worm called fluke; the *felicola hepatica*\nDiseases. hepatica of naturalists. Sometimes there are ulcers or abcesses formed in the liver, and frequently, especially in sheep, this organ is mortified or decayed.\n\nThe causes of this disease are very obscure; in horses and cattle it is said to be most common in hot seasons and warm climates, and that such of these animals as are fat are more exposed to its attacks. It may also be brought on by blows or bruises on the short ribs, by which the liver may have received some injury. In sheep it is said to be more common in dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, especially when the animals have but a scanty supply of food, and when they are of a cottive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>. It is supposed by many, that this species of rot owes its origin to the flukes that we have described, as found in the liver after death; but, as these flukes have been found in the livers of sheep that had never been apparently affected with the rot, and, as they are frequently found in the livers of old sheep, this cause is probably rather fanciful; though when these animals are very numerous, or when they are situated in a very sensitive part of the liver, they may excite a degree of irritation, and consequent inflammation, just as a great quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOTS\">bots</a> in the stomach of horses have been found to bring on inflammation of that organ.\n\nIn attempting the cure of this disease, when it is ascertained to be present, we must consider whether it is acute or chronic. When it occurs from injuries, it will probably be of the former kind, but in most other cases it will be chronic. Acute inflammation will require bleeding, purging, blisters, and low diet, as in all other cases of internal inflammation; but, in chronic hepatitis, the most likely remedy is mercury, which may be administered either internally, in the form of calomel or corrosive sublimate, or externally rubbed into the skin on some parts of the animal's body. This mercurial friction may be performed with tolerable ease on the sheep, by pulling off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> from the inside of the thighs, and rubbing a drachm or two of the strongest mercurial ointment upon these parts every night, till the general system becomes affected, which may be known by the swelling of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a>, offensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> of the breath, and increased flow of saliva from the mouth. This, however, would be an expensive and tedious cure; and if many of the flock appear affected, it would be better to kill them as fast as possible, before the disease has made such a progress as to render the animals lean. If a mercurial course should be attempted, the animals should be housed during the course, and should be kept on good nourishing food. Coffiveness must be avoided in all these cases, by the administration of gentle clysters, or occasional doses of opening physic. A very good medicine, in all cases of liver complaints, is a ball composed of calomel and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>, as directed under jaundice.\n\n9. Inflammation of the Stomach. Gastritis.\n\nThe stomach may be inflamed, both in horses and cattle, from various causes; but this is a disease, the existence of which is not easily detected. Here also Mr Blaine has supplied the want of observed symptoms by analogy, and has supposed that there would probably be unsuccessful efforts to vomit; and, as the stomach is so effectual an organ, the pulse would probably be affected even more than in inflammation of the bowels; that the animal would perhaps point to the left side about the tenth or eleventh rib; that there would be great distress evident in the countenance and manner, and that the loss of strength would be very great.\n\nIn cattle there are generally reckoned two species of inflammation of the stomach, one affecting the first stomach or paunch, and the other the third stomach or manyplies. This latter is commonly denominated lake-burn. The symptoms of the disease in these animals are also very obscure, but they are probably similar to what have been described above.\n\nIf the reader looks back to No. 409, he will see detailed, a case that occurred to Mr Clark, in which inflammation of the stomach was observed, and detected after death; and though the symptoms there described are few, they are probably more characteristic of the disease in question, than any imaginary description which we can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> from writers who have never seen the complaint.\n\nThis disease is extremely dangerous, and will not admit of a cure, unless effectual means are taken at its commencement.\n\nInflammation of the stomach is commonly produced by some acid, irritating substance which the animal has swallowed, and this is the effect produced by most poisons. A large quantity of cold water drunk while the animal is in a violent perspiration, will also produce it. It not unfrequently accompanies inflammation of the bowels, which we are immediately to describe. It is said to be sometimes produced in cattle by the giving of too strong a dose of astringent medicines to cure the red water or bloody urine; and as we have seen in No. 409, it may sometimes be occasioned by bots.\n\nThe disease can only be cured by very copious bleeding, frequently repeated; by giving mucilaginous drinks, such as water gruel or linseed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>, applying a large blister just behind the short ribs, and the frequent administration of relaxing clysters. If <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> has been swallowed, we must proceed as recommended under No. 407, though in most cases of inflammation of the stomach, it will be the most humane plan to effect a radical cure by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> the animal through the head, or cutting his throat.\n\n10. Inflammation of the Bowels. Enteritis. Red Colic. Inflammatory Colic. Dry Braxy in Sheep. Tranch\u00e9e Inflammatoire ou Rouge, Fr.\n\nThis is a disease, to which all the domestic animals are subject, but it is attended with somewhat different symptoms, in the several species.\n\nIt is generally preceded by more or less fever. In horses, the first remarkable symptoms that appear, are a great degree of restlessness, with loss of appetite, thirst, with considerable heat, and dryness of the mouth. The animal evidently labours under violent pain, and is perpetually lying down and getting up again, scraping and stamping with his feet, with which he sometimes strikes his belly. When the belly is touched with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the horse betrays extreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>, and shrinks from the touch. The pulse is always increased in frequency, and is hard, giving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> below the finger. The skin feels unusually hot, all over the body, except at the ears, which are said to be cold. The tongue is commonly covered with a white fur. Coffiveness is almost a constant symptom of this disease, and\ntill the inflammation is subdued, this continues very obstinate, or, if the animal dungs, it is in very small quantity, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCREMENT\">excrement</a> is very hard. The urine is voided in very small quantities, and with great pain, especially towards the latter period of the disease. The symptoms go on with more or less rapidity, till the inflammation is subdued by the proper remedies, or till it terminate in the death of the horse.\n\nReturning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> may be expected when the heat of the body gradually lessens, while the pulse becomes full, regular, and of the natural frequency, when the horse dungs freely, and returns to his usual appetite, and cheerfulness. But when there appears a sudden relief from pain, with a soft, feeble, or irregular pulse, and a purging of offensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> matter comes on, mortification of the bowels has taken place, and the horse will expire in a few hours.\n\nOn opening the body, evident marks of high inflammation appear in many parts of the bowels, the outer or membranous, and muscular coats of which will be found red, and in some parts black. The inflammation is frequently found to have extended to other parts, as the stomach, liver, or bladder; to some of which the guts will be frequently found adhering. On opening into the cavity of the bowels, these will be found greatly distended with air, and the great guts loaded with hardened excrement; and sometimes the inner membrane will appear highly inflamed, or even corroded, shewing evident marks of its having suffered considerable irritation, from some acrid substance.\n\nInflammation of the bowels is distinguished from colic, by the frequency and cord-like feeling of the pulse, by the presence of fever, by the tenderness of the belly, and by there being little or no remission of the pain. It is said that in colic the horse rolls much on his back, but is not so apt to do this in inflammation of the bowels. It will be seen by and by, that a long protracted colic frequently terminates in inflammation.\n\nInflammation of the bowels may be produced by acrid or poisonous substances taken into the stomach. It has been sometimes produced by giving heliobore to horses, as a purge; and it is said to arise sometimes from giving purgatives at improper times, or in too large a dose. It is very commonly brought on by giving the horse cold water, when he is much fatigued, and so much overheated, as to be in a profuse sweat, or by dashing cold water upon him, by wading in cold water, or by standing in a draught of cold air, under similar circumstances of fatigue and sweating. Constipation too long neglected, or entangled rupture, is also not an uncommon cause.\n\nIn the treatment of the inflammation of the bowels, as in all other internal inflammations, we must begin with copious and repeated bloodletting, after which a free evacuation of the bowels must be attempted by back-raking and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INJECTION\">injection</a> of softening clysters, such as warm water-gruel, mixed with half an English pint of castor oil. All acrid clysters must be avoided, as they will only tend to increase the inflammatory affection of the bowels, and even Glauber salts and other saline purgatives are scarcely proper, from the irritation they may produce. After bleeding and evacuating the bowels, warm fomentations applied to the belly may be of service, and the cloths should be applied as hot as possible. After the fomentation, the belly may be rubbed with some stimulating liniment, such as oil of turpentine, or essence of mustard. Firing has been recommended below the belly, as also frequent friction with the curry-comb, so as to irritate the skin, and almost make it bleed. Probably no medicine should be given by the mouth, farther than softening, diluting drinks, such as warm water-gruel or linseed tea. Food at the beginning of the disease is out of the question; but when the inflammation is a little relieved, the horse may have a bran mash. The body should be kept warm by clothing, and all exercise should be avoided.\n\nInflammation of the bowels in sheep is called dry braxy in Scotland, and of this disease we have an excellent account in Mr Findlater's survey of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEEBLES\">Peebles</a>.\n\nThis disease is most fatal to young and robust sheep about six or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> months old, called in many parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, hogs. It is more destructive upon some farms than others; and even upon these, in one season more than another. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOG\">hog</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FENCE\">fence</a>, or pasture capable of keeping 30 score of hogs, there is in some years, a loss from three to four score. This is a very serious matter, as each of these would sell in the spring, or beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, for half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUINEA\">guinea</a> or 11s. This disease begins at those times when inflammatory disorders are most apt to prevail, in the months of October and November, and is produced by the common causes of inflammation, cold, exertion, external injury, &c. During these months, flight frosts set in, and the ground in the morning is often covered with hoar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>, or what is called in some parts of Scotland <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">rhine</a>. It is probable, that eating grass covered with hoar frost, may be one cause of the disorder. If so, moving the animals about, and preventing them from eating, until the frost is melted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, may tend to prevent the disease.\n\nThis disease runs its course very rapidly. When the shepherd leaves his flock at night upon their laires, he sometimes observes a hog look dull, loitering behind, and restless; sometimes lying down and suddenly getting up again: and in the morning, he will often find it dead, or nearly so. At other times he will discover no apparent ailment among his flock; and in the morning, he may find one or two dead or dying. From this it appears that the disease is very acute.\n\nThis is further evinced by the appearances after death, when the carcases are opened. Their bellies are excessively swelled, and distended with a putrid air: the whole intestines being red and inflamed, gangrenous, and in some degree mortified. This putrid taint seems to be communicated to the whole carcase, as all the muscular parts, and fat, smell strongly of corruption. The hogs that die of this disease, are frequently fat and in good order, which shows that the disease is of short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>.\n\nWe have already mentioned the eating of grass, which is covered with hoar frost, as a very probable immediate cause of this disorder. But is there any predisposing cause?\n\nIn answer to this question, we shall adduce a fact which is well authenticated. Many parts of the western highlands of Scotland, had been for ages occupied by horses and horned cattle. At the introduction of sheep into those districts, the best grass was that which had sprung from the tush and excrements of these animals. During many years after these districts were converted into sheep farms, braxy remained unknown. It crept\nin at last, and the severity of the disease was long in proportion to the length of time the pastures had been occupied by sheep.\n\nFrom these we would infer that pasturing upon their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, is a predisposing cause of bravety among sheep; and that a frequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> of the species of stock, upon every fresh pasture, might serve to prevent the evil. This idea corresponds with the general laws of the Supreme Being, who certainly never intended that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> should be monopolized by any particular species of animals; but has so ordered matters, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of individuals shall result from the happiness of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of animated beings.\n\nHence it would appear a beneficial practice in those farmers, in place of one fence, to keep two or more enclosures of this description, and change the flock upon them every season. This we know to be contrary to general practice, and that what is called the hogs fence, is carefully guarded against the intrusion of every other animal.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMBS\">Lambs</a>, immediately after they are weaned are frequently sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> pasture, which is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> them. Now this appears to be a very bad practice; for the consequence is, that they fall off considerably, before they get at the rich grass in the hogs' fence, of which they eat too freely; and thus become disposed to the disease treated of. Children, and all domesticated animals, are carefully fed with nourishing food for a considerable time after they are weaned; and yet they fall off for some time. It would certainly be better to give the lambs the hogs fence at once, and use every precaution to prevent them from falling off.\n\nAs the disease is generally advanced to a dangerous height before it is observed, we fear that medicine affords but a very faint hope of cure. The disease being inflammatory, the shepherd should attempt to bleed the distressed creature as soon as possible; which he can easily do, by cutting off part of the tail, or by nicking it underneath, or by cutting off part of the ears. The animal should then be removed to a house or shed, and attempts made to produce evacuations. In brute animals, it is difficult to produce these by medicines administered by the mouth. The quickest and most effectual method, is by injections into the rectum or anus. Such injection may consist of a small handful of chamomile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, two spoonfuls of aniseed, and as much caraway seeds; to be boiled slowly in a Scotch mutton or English pint of milk and water, until the half is evaporated. The liquor should then be strained off, and two tea spoonfuls of castor oil added, or if this is not at hand, the same quantity of sweet oil may be used. This should be administered warm by an injection bag and pipe, or by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> bottle with a pipe properly fitted. Nothing can be easier, than to give a sheep a clyster in this way; and, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> it will have a happy effect in evacuating the bowels and procuring relief.\n\nIf this does not appear very soon, it may be repeated an hour after, and a large spoonful of common salt added to the former ingredients. If, after all, the animal does not seem relieved, another clyster may be given, consisting of a small tea cupful of warm milk and water, to which are added from 20 to 25 drops of laudanum.\n\nAs there is a great dilution of the stomach and bowels, arising from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIRS\">airs</a> or elastic vapours, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> in the intestines, Mr Walker of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a>, in a treatise he wrote upon the diseases of brute animals, has suggested a remedy for this disorder, which has often proved successful in his district. It consists in pushing down their throats a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> tube, such as Dr Monro has recommended, and which has proved successful in relieving cows that had over gorged themselves with red clover early in the season (see No. 405.). This seems a probable means of affording temporary relief, and every shepherd that has the care of the hog flock, should be furnished with one of these tubes, adapted to the size of the sheep, for trying the experiment upon those that labour under the disease.\n\n\"In regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of pasture (adds Mr Findlater) as a cause of sickness, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TWEEDDALE\">Tweeddale</a> farmers seem of opinion that it arises from the foulness of the grass at the root in the hogs fences, which are never eaten bare. Some, therefore, take care to have the land to be saved for the hog fence, once eaten as bare as possible early in summer, by the black cattle upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a>, or by old sheep.\n\n\"It seems ascertained in Tweeddale, that land which has been in use to be pastured by older sheep, when converted into a hog fence, is not liable for some time to produce sickness. Two accidental experiments occurring in which this practice took place, in consequence of new arrangements in the farms of Harehope in Edendale <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>, and of Lyne in Lyne parish, confirm this conclusion. It is farther confirmed by an experiment of Mr Murray, tenant in Flemington mill. About 20 years ago, he bought in different parcels of lambs for hogs, and laid them upon the hog fence of his hog farm of Broughton-haup, in Broughton parish. In one of the parcels of much higher condition than the rest, the sickness broke out to such extent, that they were dying at the rate of two or three daily; so that the whole parcel seemed in imminent risk. He transferred this whole parcel to the farm of Fingland in Newlands parish, where only old sheep were kept, putting them on some of the lower pasture of that farm, which had been harnessed for feeding the crock <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EWES\">ewes</a>, and transferring a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> quantity of these ewes to Broughton-haup hog fence. Not one of the lambs died upon Fingland. To the same effect, it deserves attention, that in small farms, not admitting of distinct hirling, where, of course, old and young sheep pasture mixed together, hogs are very little liable to sickness, though perhaps worse in other respects.\n\n\"From November at sowing time till Christmas (1797) two facts with regard to the mode of cure have been stated to me, and which I am disposed to think authentic. In the farm of Drummelzier, parish of Drummelzier, three hogs (out of four upon which the experiment was tried) recovered, upon bleeding, and having poured down their throats, a decoction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>; about a finger's length of twist tobacco boiled in water till the water has diminished to a gill, being the dose for each. In the farm of Broughton-haup, parish of Broughton, within the same space of time, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> or ten (out of 16 or 17 upon whom the experiment was made) recovered upon bleeding, and having an injection of tobacco <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> administered from a common tobacco pipe, by kindling the tobacco, inserting the pipe shank into the anus and blowing; the experiment, however, was not so successful.\"\nI have long ago seen a ewe cured by bleeding, and injection of Glauber salts from a common clyfter-bag and pipe. When braxy breaks out, it might be useful, where attainable, to lay the hogs, nightly, upon dry ground, if the hog fence is wet, the chilliness of wet ground contributing no doubt to the production of inflammation. Clover faggage or turnips might be good preventives from inducing a lax\n\n**II. DYSENTERY. Molten-grease or Body-founder, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">Break</a>-blow, (in sheep). Gras fondu, Fr.**\n\nDysentery is the other disease that, with catarrh, forms Dr Cullen's order of profusia; but as there are evident marks of inflammation of the bowels observed on inspecting the bodies of such animals as have died of this complaint, we have placed it immediately after inflammation of the bowels, in which we have followed M. Pinel and some other late writers.\n\nThis disease is not uncommon in the horse, and probably it is still more frequent in cattle and sheep. It very commonly begins with some degree of fever, as a trembling, dryness of the mouth, loss of appetite, a great degree of weakness, drooping of the head and ears, sometimes a copious sweating, but more commonly dryness and heat of the skin. There is usually a heaving of the flanks, and the animal turns his head towards them, as if gripped. There are frequent defecations from the anus, but these seldom consist of the natural excrement, but of a mucous, slimy discharge, accompanied with a peculiar fatty substance like soft fat. There is evidently much distress during these evacuations, and sometimes the fundament appears excoriated. It is not uncommon to see blood pass with the stools, generally in streaks, but sometimes in such a quantity as to tinge the whole discharge of a red <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>; and in the latter stages of the disease there generally appear membranous, fatty substances, which have been compared to soaked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>. These substances have been supposed to be the inner membrane of the bowels that has been eroded and thrown off by the violence of the purging; but they are merely coagulable lymph, such as is very commonly thrown off from inflamed surfaces. The pulse, towards the beginning of the disease, is commonly hard and full, but as the complaint goes on it becomes quick, small, and sometimes irregular. The animal is very stiff, and much averse to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, and if the disease continues long, there usually comes on a swelling of the legs.\n\nWhen animals that have died of this disease are dissected, the inner coat of the bowels is found inflamed, in some places covered with coagulable lymph, such as we have described as being thrown out in the discharge, and not unfrequently ulcerated in various parts, sometimes mortified and corroded.\n\nThis disease does not appear so dangerous among the inferior animals in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, as in warmer countries; but it sometimes proves fatal, or terminates in a weakness of the bowels and scouring, that are not easily removed. If the fever is but little or soon abates, if the animal appears not to labour under much pain, and if the discharge of natural excrement soon returns, the disease will probably terminate favourably in a short time; but if there is great pain and fever, with excessive weakness, and if the mucous discharges continue very frequent, and mixed with much blood, the danger is considerable.\n\nIt is necessary to distinguish this complaint from the common purging or scouring, with which it is very generally confounded. It must therefore be observed, that in scouring, there is no fever, whereas this is common in dysentery; that the discharge in scouring, though thin, has almost always the appearance of excrement, is not bloody, and is scarcely ever mixed with fatty matter.\n\nDysentery is more common in hot weather, and in hot seasons, than at other times; but is very commonly produced by the sudden application of cold, especially to the legs or belly, while the body is overheated and fatigued; hence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a> in autumn, drinking large quantities of cold water while in a profuse sweat, or other sudden changes from heat to cold, have commonly produced it. It is said to be frequently brought on by riding a horse very hard in hot weather. Mr Lawrence says that when a boy, he rode a horse that had a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of loose green flesh about him, 21 miles in a warm summer morning, and thus brought on an attack of molten grease. It is also not an uncommon disease among <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLO\">polo</a> horses.\n\nFrom the appearance of the fatty matter in the discharge that takes place in this complaint, the older writers on farriery were induced to give it the name of molten grease, conceiving that a principal part of the disease consisted in a melting down of the fat of the animal, which being conveyed by the absorbents into the circulation, is thrown out by the exhalants on the bowels, and carried off with the dung. Mr Blaine laughs very heartily at this idea, and seems to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> himself on the discovery, that what has been mistaken for fat, is nothing more than an increased secretion of the mucus of the intestines, and is as liable to a horse with little fat, as to one with much. Mr Lawrence, on the other hand, argues strenuously that this matter is really greasy, and says, \"with respect to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>,\" had Mr Blaine ever seen a horse under the discharge of molten grease, he might have found on experiment, that part of the discharges in question is inflammable and liquefiable, which are not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of albumen, but of real grease; and, (continues Mr Lawrence) viewing the matter through the medium of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, I can see no sort of improbability in a colligation of loose, substantial, internal fat, by sudden inflammation, and its consequent effusion and discharge by an unusual emunctory. Gibbon gives an instance which convinced him (apparently incredulous before) of the possibility of a horse's grease being melted. He found the fat melted and turned into an oil, and drawn off from its proper cells into the blood vessels. He says farther, this disease is not unlike the greasy diarrhoea which happens to men.\" Not having ourselves seen a case of dysentery in horses, we are not prepared to decide the difference between these two champions of the old and new school, but as Mr Lawrence is very worthy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> in whatever has passed under his own observation, we have no doubt that this debated substance is of a fatty nature.\n\nAs it seems certain that dysentery is of an inflammatory nature, it is proper to begin the cure by bleeding, especially if the horse is plethoric, or if the pulse is full and hard. It will then be proper to clear the bowels by\nDiseases by a laxative clyster, and to give internally a drench composed of five or six ounces of Glauber's salt dissolved in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUART\">quart</a> of water-gruel, or the drench No. 26 of the receipts; and this may be repeated every three or four hours. This will probably, in the course of the day, produce a plentiful discharge of excrement, and when the bowels appear well cleared, the horse may have a warm bath, be covered up warm, and perhaps a perspiration will be brought on, which, if the disease is slight, will probably complete the cure. If the disease should continue, an English pint, or pint and a half, of castor oil may be given, and clysters, composed of water-gruel, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STARCH\">starch</a> boiled in water, should be given warm very frequently. When by these means a pretty copious discharge of excrement has been produced, the horse may have a ball composed of two drachms of opium, and half an ounce of ipecacuanha, or a drachm of emetic tartar, washed down with a quart of good porter. If there is considerable pain, it may be advisable to foment the belly for half an hour at a time, with flannels wrung out of a warm decoction of poppy heads. During this treatment the horse should be kept clothed, and currents of air in the stable should be avoided. When the disease is subdued, as the horse will probably remain very weak, it will be proper to revive him by nourishing diet, and cordial and strengthening remedies.\n\nThe appearances of dysentery in cattle are not unlike those that occur in the horse, only that perhaps in them there is not so much of the gras fondu. The disease among these animals is commonly called far-del-bound. The treatment is the same as above described.\n\nThis disease is not uncommon in sheep, by the name of break/bow; but shepherds very commonly confound it with diarrhoea or purging. Mr. Loch of Rachan, very properly distinguishes between them, and observes that the break/bow is analogous to dysentery in the human species, and occurs most commonly in the end of wet summers. The discharge is thin and greenish (Mr. Loch supposes from the wet grass becoming acid in the stomach, and turning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALL\">gall</a> green); it is more or less mixed with blood, sometimes florid, sometimes black and grumous; the animal pines for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> or two and dies, though sometimes he recovers. The cure commonly employed by Mr. Loch's herd, is warm milk poured down the animal's throat; but Mr. Loch proposes to try, in addition to this, nitre in half drachm doses, with chalk or some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> powder, and 20 or 30 drops of laudanum twice or thrice a day, with frequent injections of warm milk and water. This plan seems best adapted to the latter stages of the disease. According to Mr. Gillespie of Glenquich (quoted by Mr. Findlater), this disease is often produced by overheating, when the sheep are hunted by dogs, in folding them, &c., or when otherwise scared and terrified. It is stated by Mr. Gillespie to be considerably infectious; and he considers tarring part of the flock to be the best means of checking the infection, under the idea that the smell of the tar will overcome that of the contagion.\n\n12. INFLAMMATION of the Kidneys. Nephritis. Strain of the Kidneys.\n\nThis disease is not uncommon among horses and cattle; but it is more frequent in the former, as they are more exposed to those causes that appear generally to produce it.\n\nThe symptoms of this disease in horses, are tolerably well marked. The horse stands wide with his hind-legs, appears dull, and expresses considerable pain, often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> at his flanks. When pressure is made on the loins the horse flinches, and is evidently much distended; the pulse is hard and full, and commonly more frequent than natural. When both kidneys are inflamed, little or no urine is secreted, and what little is evacuated is generally bloody; but when only one kidney is inflamed, the other continues to secrete urine, but the natural quantity is on the whole much diminished, and there is commonly considerable pain during the evacuation.\n\nInflammation of the kidneys is liable to be confounded with inflammation of the neck of the bladder, and the best means of distinguishing them, is to pass the hand up the fundament, by which the state of the bladder beneath may be easily ascertained. If the bladder be considerably distended with urine, the inflammation is almost certainly seated in the neck of the bladder; but if the bladder be shrunk and empty, the disease is probably situated in the kidneys. It must be allowed, however, that this mark of discrimination will not hold good till the disease of the kidneys is pretty far advanced, as it very commonly happens that when a gland is inflamed, its secretion is at first increased. At the commencement of the disease, therefore, the symptoms which we have enumerated, especially the tendency which the horse evinces on touching his loins, are chiefly to be depended on. It must be remarked, that one of the kidneys has been found diseased, and even putrefied, after death, when it showed no marks of inflammation during life. This disease is attended with considerable danger, and unless the inflammation be speedily removed, matter will be formed, which, if it does not pass off by the urinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> into the bladder, will find a passage into the belly, or behind the peritoneum, and produce hectic fever and consumption, or the kidney may mortify, and death will soon follow.\n\nThe kidneys may become inflamed, either from external injury, or from irritating substances that pass through them in the course of the circulation. Inflammation of these organs is frequently produced by placing the saddle too far back upon the loins, and riding hard for a long time while it is in this position. It is sometimes the effect of throwing cold water upon the body while it is in a sweat; but according to Mr. Blaine and Mr. Feron, it is most frequently produced by the indiscriminate use of strong diuretic medicines.\n\nIn the treatment of this disease, we must vigorously employ the means that we have so often recommended for the cure of internal inflammations; bleeding in its full extent, emollient clysters, and the production of external inflammation: but it is necessary in this disease to caution the practitioner against the use of blisters, as the matter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTHARIDES\">cantharides</a>, when taken into the circulation, and carried to the kidneys, will considerably increase the inflammation and distress. A good substitute for blisters of cantharides would be, to pour hot water on the loins, so as to raise a blister on each side, which, however cruel it may appear, could not produce so much pain, as the animal already feels from the disease. It has...\nhas been recommended, to excite a degree of inflammation in the external part of the loins, by means of firing; but probably the hot water will do as well, and is less painful. No medicine should be given by the mouth, that is in the least heating or irritating; and nitre, turpentine, balsam of copaiva, &c., so warmly recommended by most of the writers on farriery, would only serve to aggravate the disease. The horse may drink frequently of water gruel, linseed tea, or such other mild, mucilaginous liquors; and if he seems to require food, bran mash will be the most proper article of diet. If there is much coliciveness, purgative clysters may be given, or in cases of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, fix or seven drachms of colocynthine alone in a ball. All exercise must be avoided, and the horse should have a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of litter, on which he may lie down when fatigued.\n\n13. Inflammation of the Bladder. Cystitis.\n\nThe bladder may be inflamed either in its body, or in its neck, and the symptoms differ somewhat in these two varieties. When the body of the bladder is inflamed, there is produced such a degree of irritation, that the bladder becomes incapable of retaining its contents for any length of time; and the animal is perpetually making small quantities of urine. He also makes frequent attempts to dung. On palpating the hand up the fundament, the bladder will be found very hot and sensible; and in this variety of the complaint, as in inflammation of the kidneys, it is empty and collapsed.\n\nWhen the neck of the bladder is inflamed, there is at first a suppression of the urine, but afterwards it is continually passing off in drops; and on examining the bladder by the fundament, it will be found more or less distended, according to the continuance of the complaint. There is usually considerable fever in both cases. The pulse is hard and full at the beginning of the disease, but after this has continued for some time, the pulse becomes small and oppressed.\n\nInflammation of the bladder takes place more frequently in males than in females; animals; but it is said to be sometimes produced in the latter, at least in mares, by palping some irritating substance up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URETHRA\">urethra</a>, in order to make them horly. Both cases of this disease are attended with considerable danger; but the latter is generally the most dangerous; but in a mare a cure is generally easier than in a horse.\n\nThe treatment of this complaint differs little from that of the inflammation of the kidneys, and chiefly consists in bleeding, the frequent use of softening clysters, low diet, and the production of external inflammation by any other means than the use of cantharides blisters. If the bladder be found considerably distended, it will be necessary to evacuate the urine, either by the means of a catheter, which may be easily palped up in a mare, or by making an opening into the bladder; for performing which in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a>, Mr Feron gives the following directions. \"It happens that the urethra is so constructed, that it is not in our power to introduce an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> immediately into the bladder, without performing an operation; for the urethra of the horse forms two curvatures or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, before it reaches the bladder, and therefore it is not possible to introduce an instrument into the bladder, which will preserve its curvity all the way. We therefore introduce a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a> of a pliable wood, or whalebone, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> at the os <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-PUBIS\">pubis</a>, as near the rectum as possible with safety; we make a cut upon it, and then introduce the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> catheter, or some similar tube, without however removing the staff to prevent our losing the incision, taking care to avoid the instrument's pushing into the cellular membrane, instead of entering the bladder. If such an accident was likely to happen, it is advisable not to attempt the operation, but to continue and insist upon all the emollient remedies.\n\n\"We may also puncture the bladder with a trocar, by the rectum, or through the inferior part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a>.\n\n\"In either case we are likewise directed by Mr Coleman, to make the puncture as near the os pubis as possible, that we may not wound the peritoneum anteriorly. By this method the operation recommended through the rectum may be performed without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a>, or opening the cavity of the abdomen.\"*\n\nIn the female an opening may be easily made into the bladder, with a trocar, introduced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VAGINA\">vagina</a>.\u2020\n\nIt has been recommended in the mare, to throw up an injection of some oily or mucilaginous fluid, to supply the place of mucus, in sheathing the bladder from the irritation of urine. As in the inflammation of the kidneys, every thing that can heat or irritate the urinary organs must be carefully avoided.\n\n14. Cords.\n\nIt is well known in most breeding countries, that a great many calves die every year, of an unknown disease, with which they are affected very shortly after birth. The common name which this disease receives in Scotland, is the cords; and while its fatal and widely extended effects are the subject of just regret, the disease itself is looked on as incurable, and no pains are taken to investigate its nature, symptoms and causes, and no remedies suggested, as a cure or preventive. Whatever be its nature, this disease is exceedingly dangerous, and so extremely rapid, (terminating frequently in a night's time), that all means of relief are commonly useless even before it is observed.\n\nAlmost all calves, that are said to have died of the cords, appear, when they are opened up, exceedingly red, and the small leaders, or ligaments, are considerably swollen, and have some resemblance to strings palping through the internal parts, from which probably the disease has its name. Every symptom indicates a considerable degree of plethora, if not a very high degree of inflammation.\n\nIt is commonly observed, that calves are most liable to be affected during the first days, or weeks, after they are calved. If they outlive five or six weeks, they are seldom in any danger.\n\nCalves that suck their mothers, we believe, it will be found, are not so liable to the disease, as those who are fed by the hand.\n\nThe greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of calves who fall a sacrifice to this disease, if not the whole of them, are those who are closely confined to the house from their birth, without ever being exposed to the free open air without doors. It is a well known fact, that calves who are dropt without, and remain in the fields, are in little or no danger. Cows that are laid on to graze for beef frequently turn out to be in calf; and it is no uncommon thing to see them drop their calves in the midst of frost and snow, and yet\nthese young creatures, if they can once get to their feet, without being frozen to the ground, are hearty and well. Calves, lambs, and foals, require exercise and fresh air; and nature directs them to take a great deal. It is astonishing to see with what force and vigour, (particularly the calf), and how long, they will run. But this free, unconstrained, and severe exercise without doors, seems to be the very thing that makes them thrive, and to be necessary to their very existence.*\n\nThe great object is to prevent this disease; and the following method of treating the new-born calves, practised by a correspondent of the Farmers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>, seems to be attended with complete success.\n\nThe time when this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>'s cows are bulled is regularly noted down in a book; and when they are near calving, they are watched frequently night and day. As soon as the calf is dropped, it is received into a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASKET\">basket</a> or skull, made of willows, with a handle at each end, and plenty of clean straw in it. It is then carried by two persons to the stall in the calf-house, where it is gently rubbed with straw. The calf-basket is next to the cow-brye; and is fitted up with flails like a stable, about three feet wide, and about five feet long. Every stall thus in itself, with a door and hinges, for fear of the calf lying back too far, to choke itself in its binding. As soon as the mother has had a little rest after calving, she is milked, and a little of the milk given to the calf as early as possible. If the weather is cold, and the mother long in giving milk, it is taken to the fire, and warmed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAN\">pan</a> until it is blood-warm, and then given to the calf; about six or eight gills, according to the size of the calf, and repeated four times in 24 hours. As the calf gathers strength, the quantity may be increased; but too much milk at one time is as bad as too little, until it is a month or six weeks old. When the calf is able to stand, it is tied to a stake; as it is more in the power of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> to give it milk in that situation, than when going about loose. If a calf gets cold milk, it is sure to bring on a trembling; and the cords or some other malady follows; which he has often seen exemplified amongst the neighbouring young stock\u2020.\n\n15. Farcy. Le Farcin, Fr.\n\nWe shall conclude this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> with a brief account of two diseases; or rather, as it should seem, of two modifications of the same disease, that frequently take place in the horse, to whom they are almost peculiar; though something like them is occasionally found in other animals. We shall hereafter take notice of what farriers call the water farcy, which we consider as similar to angina in the human body; but the disease we are about to describe, appears to be rather a peculiar inflammatory affection of the absorbent vessels below the skin. There seems to be two varieties of farcy, acute and chronic; or rather a mild and a malignant variety.\n\nThe commencement of farcy appears to be rather obscure, and probably it is seldom observed in the beginning of the inflammation. The first appearances that are described by writers, are a number of swellings, that rise in almost every part of the body, particularly the head, neck, and extremities. The lymphatic vessels below the skin appear like knotted cords; and this appearance is found to be owing to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a> and inflammation that take place in these vessels, especially at their valves, where the knots are produced. As the disease proceeds, these knotted swellings burst, and ulcers are formed, which are very difficult to heal. The formation of these ulcers may be considered as terminating the mild stage, and commencing the malignant form of the disease; in which the horse loses his appetite, grows lean and weak, and commonly has a degree of hectic fever. If the progress of the disease has not been arrested, a swelling takes place in the head and nose, and there comes on from the latter a copious discharge of a peculiar glairy mucus, which shows that the disease has degenerated into glanders, under which name we shall proceed to describe it; and shall afterwards consider the nature, causes, and treatment of both.\n\n16. Glanders. Le Morve, Fr.\n\nAccording to Mr Blaine, the usual symptoms of glanders are an increased secretion of the mucus of the nose, which is at first thick, and like the white of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>. He has seen it continue so, while at other times it becomes purulent; but there is usually a degree of viscidity and glueiness about the matter, that as it were fixes the sides of the nostrils together, and is strongly characteristic of this disease. On examining the nostrils, there may generally be perceived a number of ulcerated surfaces, very similar to blisters that occur in the venereal disease. These ulcers do not always appear soon; but they are produced in all virulent cases, and never fail to appear when the disease terminates fatally. They are at first small, and disposed in lines along the lymphatic vessels; but as the ulceration proceeds, it becomes more extensive, till the whole inner surface of the nostrils is affected, and at length the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> of the nose are affected, and become carious. When the ulcers have continued for some time, the matter changes its glairy appearance, and becomes bloody and offensive; and this is more particularly the case when the bones become diseased. In the latter stages of the complaint, the emaciation and weakness of the animal are greatly increased; he becomes affected with a short tickling cough; the hair grows dry and harsh, and falls off on the slightest touch, and thus the horse gradually pines away.\n\nSometimes only one side of the head is affected, but more commonly both at the same time.\n\nThe best account of the appearances of glanders on dissection, has been given by M. Chabert, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> which he published in 1785, on the means of ascertaining the existence of glanders, and of preventing their effects. From the numerous bodies which he opened, M. Chabert has drawn up the following general account of the morbid appearances.\n\nThe lungs are generally more affected than any other of the viscera; we find them often swelled and filled with hydatids, tubercles, and obstructions. The bronchial glands are very often swelled and ulcerated, and this is sometimes the only injury that we can perceive on dissections. The membrane that lines the bronchia and the wind-pipe, is most commonly inflamed and ulcerated; the bronchia are filled with a thick matter, that commonly resembles what the animal discharges by the nostrils. The internal surface of the bones that form the different cavities of the nose, and the grilly partition of the nostrils, are often carious, and covered with purulent matter; and the membrane which lines the nostrils...\nnostrils is ulcerated. The spleen, the liver, and the kidneys, are also sometimes considerably diseased; and the ulcerated state of the kidneys, not unfrequently appears during life, by the purulent matter that is discharged with the urine. On opening the head, we sometimes find the brain softer and more flaccid than in a healthy animal. There is often a great quantity of serum in its cavities, and the glands are much swollen.\n\nThe glanders is liable to be confounded with several of those diseases, in which an unusual discharge proceeds from the nostrils; as catarrh, strangles, and consumption; but chiefly with the two former. It may be distinguished from catarrh, by the absence of fever in the early stage; by the matter discharged from the nostrils being thick and glairy from the first; whereas, in catarrh, there is almost always considerable fever in the beginning, and the discharge is at first watery. In a common cold the general health is also more or less affected, and from the first there is usually a cough and loss of appetite; whereas, these symptoms scarcely ever come on in glanders, till the disease has subsided for a considerable time. Glanders may be distinguished from strangles by the high fever which commences the latter, and by the swelling and speedy suppuration of the glands of the mouth and throat.\n\nOf these two affections, glanders is the most dangerous; as farcy, when taken at its commencement, may frequently be removed; but we believe the instances of a perfect cure in glanders are very rare.\n\nThe causes of these complaints are very obscure. It is said that farcy may be brought on by the same causes that predispose to mange, as want of cleanliness, hard work, and low diet; and there is no doubt, that this disease, as well as glanders, is contagious. Glanders, besides being produced by contagion, may also be the termination of several disorders, as of catarrh, strangles, and consumption, however different from these diseases in their commencement.\n\nThe nature of glanders is not well understood, although, of late, many ingenious men have investigated the subject, and made considerable discoveries. It is not certain when the disease was first known. Mr Lawrence dates it from the same period with the Lues Venerei; but there seems no doubt that the disease was known to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, though we do not know by what name it was called. Vegetius speaks of a disease which he calls humiditas, which Mr Blaine supposes to be the same with our glanders; but which the learned Camper considers as analogous to the murrain, See No 466. Blundevil, and after him Markham, give the following description of its rise, progress, and completion. \"Of cold first cometh the p\u00f6l\u00e9, (that is stoppage of the head), and the cough, and then the glanders, and last of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">mourning</a> of the chine.\" The two Messieurs Lafoffe, made, as we have seen, several discoveries with respect to glanders, especially the father, who, in 1749, demonstrated before the academy of sciences at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, that the seat of the disease is wholly in the pituitary membrane; and he proposed curing it by injecting the whole of this membrane through openings made with the trepan, into the frontal, nasal, and maxillary sinuses. Lafoffe divided the disease into several species; but it appears that all these may be reduced to two, the mild and malignant, or the chronic and acute; the chronic being that in which the running of the nose is trifling, and of a transparent colour, with no appearances of ulceration in the nostrils; while in the acute or malignant variety, there is considerable ulceration; the discharge is very offensive; there is a swelling below the under jaw, and the bones of the nose are carious.\n\nThe best of the English writers on farriery appear to have known little or nothing of the disease more than the symptoms. Dr Bracken considered it as not contagious, and Gibbon gives but a poor account of it, for which he seems indebted to Snape.\n\n\"The late professor of the veterinary college (says Mr Blaine), published his remarks on this disease, but it is evident that he knew little or nothing relating to it, but what he gained from Lafoffe, and consequently his opinions offered nothing new. The present professor has prosecuted the inquiries relative to it much farther, and by an extensive course of experiments has thrown very considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the nature of the disease; and though we are not yet much more successful in attempts at the cure, yet we have less reason to despair. By Mr Coleman's experiments it is proved beyond a doubt that farcy and glanders are specifically the same disease, but affecting different parts: to establish this, horses have been inoculated with the matter of farcy, and glanders has been produced; which puts the matter beyond a doubt. Further, Mr Coleman produced glanders in a found animal by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INOCULATION\">inoculation</a> with the matter of glanders. This M. St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELL\">Bell</a> affected could not be done. Farcy has likewise been produced by the same means, but it appears that it was some time before it could be effected; but it has been produced by Mr White. It cannot therefore be inferred, that because the farcy and glanders are so different in their apparent situations they are distinct diseases: every poison has its preference of parts; and likewise the same poison, under different modifications affects different parts.\n\nMr Coleman is of opinion, that in glanders, the whole circulating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> are affected. To prove this, he bled an ass from the jugular vein till he was to all appearance dead, when he introduced the blood from the carotid artery of a horse labouring under glanders, till the ass was reanimated. In a few days the most malignant glanders appeared. I believe another ass was inoculated from this, which became glandered. This experiment, I think, (adds Mr Blaine), throws great light on this complaint, and indeed on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATHOLOGY\">pathology</a> in general; and we may hence be led to hope, that internal remedies may be more useful than external, which have been thought to be the only means by which we could hope for a cure; for provided we could destroy the poison existing in the blood, and keeping up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> in the part; the action, or at least the specific part of it, might cease in the affected part, and we might induce a healing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> by the usual means. As such, our only hope must consist in exciting a new action in the system, whereby the glanderous one will be suspended, till by the continuance of the new action the virus of glanders is completely expelled by the change the fluids naturally undergo.\"\n\nThe treatment of these diseases will differ according to their state and degree of malignity. For the cure vol. ii. p. of 525.\nDiseases of farcy, blisters are much extolled by Mr Feron, and the actual cautery, is very generally employed to destroy the swellings of the lymphatics, and to excite these vessels into greater action. To assist this purpose, diuretics are to be administered, and the horse should take as much exercise, especially draught labour, as he will bear without considerable fatigue. Two remedies have of late been employed internally, when the system becomes considerably affected; these are verdigris, and corrosive sublimate. Mr Feron directs the former to be given in the following manner. A ball composed of one drachm of verdigris, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an ounce of common turpentine, is to be given every night and morning, gradually increasing the quantity of verdigris till the horse can take from three drachms to half an ounce in the course of the day. If the animal becomes colicive, he is to have a clyster night and morning, and a purgative ball of seven drachms of aloes, and half a drachm of calomel once a week. After having gone through a regular course of physic, he is to have the following balls. An ounce of green copperas (x) in powder is to be mixed up with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> turpentine, and a sufficient quantity of linseed powder, to make eight balls, one of which is to be given every morning, while coltiveness is to be avoided as before directed.\n\nIn giving the corrosive sublimate, we should begin with a small dose (see Stimulants), and gradually increase it so long as the stomach will easily bear it. As mercury in some form seems to be the best remedy that can be employed in these affections, calomel, or the common blue pill, may be given instead of the corrosive sublimate, if the latter should occasion much disorder, or if the horse is very much weakened. During this course the animal must be supported by nourishing diet, but should frequently have a change of succulent vegetable food. Mr Blaine speaks of a horse that was so far reduced (by glanders, we suppose) as not to be able to stand, and who was drawn into a field of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARES\">tares</a>, and suffered to take his chance; the consequence was that when he had eaten all within his reach, he was able to rise and search for more, and eventually recovered.\n\nThe treatment recommended above has, it seems, often been successful in farcy, and the same internal remedies have been recommended in glanders, but we believe they have been employed with little success. Mr Feron advises to draw blood in the beginning of glanders, while the disease is still local, and to keep the animal upon warm mashes of bran, putting the same into a nose-bag, for the purpose of fomenting the nostrils. He is then to go through a course of gentle physic, while strict attention is paid to the necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the food, exercise, dressing, cleanliness, and water. The water must be always warm, and made white with bran or gravel. After this course, he recommends balls made of opium, arsenic, and sulphur, or of extract of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-HEMLOCK\">hemlock</a>, calomel, &c., avoiding coltiveness during their exhibition. He thinks it necessary to insert two rows, one below the under jaw near the swelling, and another under the chest; and he recommends frequently syringing the nostrils with a lotion made of two ounces of spirit of wine, and the same quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a>, mixed with a gallon of water; or with a solution of corrosive sublimate. According to this gentleman, if the disorder is attacked in its infancy, it will generally submit to the above course of treatment; but if the disorder is so far advanced as to exhibit the symptoms of virulence, which we have described as constituting the acute or malignant stage of it, it will increase in opposition to all art, and it will be necessary to take away a life that every degree of affluence would not render worth preserving.\n\nAs the farcy is probably contagious, and the glanders in most cases is certainly so, it is proper, as soon as a horse is affected with either of these diseases, to keep him in a separate stable, and to take care that he does not come near any other horses; and no part of his harness, or furniture should be used for any other horse, till it has been well washed with soap and water, and exposed for a long time to the pure air.\n\nGlanders is considered by Dr Darwin, and some other writers, as a contagious catarrh, and in some cases it certainly is so; but when it is the consequence of farcy, or of dangerous chronic diseases, it appears to be an affection of a peculiar kind. Mr Lawrence considers the glanders as so perfectly incurable, that he recommends the collarmakers knife as the easiest, cheapest, and most infallible remedy.\n\n**Chap. III. Of Lethargic or Comatose Diseases.**\n\n1. **Apoplexy.** Vertigo, Fr. Staggers, Sleepy Staggers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETHARGY\">Lethargy</a>, or Vertigo.\n\nStaggers is one of the most comprehensive terms in apoplexy, farriery; and under it are confounded almost every affection of the brain, or all those diseases in which there take place giddiness, unusual heaviness, drowsiness, or convulsions. We have already seen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> applied to inflammation of the brain, and we have no doubt that many cases are described as staggers, which are really instances of epilepsy. Of this kind we consider the case so humorously related by Mr Lawrence in his treatise on horses, vol. ii. p. 426. \"Walking up <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">Fleet</a>-street, I observed a crowd of people wonderfully diverted with the agonies of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CART\">cart</a>-horse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> himself almost to pieces, in, I think, the most violent convulsions I ever witnessed. He threw himself repeatedly upon the foot-path, and was very near going headlong into a shop, &c.\"\n\nMr Feron, who in general keeps very clear of the errors of ordinary farriers, which he often ridicules with much success, has confounded inflammation of the brain and apoplexy, under the general name of staggers, considering them as both inflammatory, and merely modifications of the same disease. Even Mr Blaine, who, as Mr Lawrence expresses himself, seems upon every occasion eager to catch the dernier go\u00fbt of science, has\n\n---\n\n(x) Mr Feron directs green <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>; but we suppose this is merely a typographical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, for copperas, or sulphate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>; and we have therefore ordered it by this name, as sulphate of iron is a good tonic, and may be very properly employed in this disease.\ndescribed flaggers under the name of lethargy, and does not even mention its identity with apoplexy in the human body.\n\nWe consider flaggers properly so called, as the same with apoplexy; the appearances, the causes, and the treatment of both are the same, making allowance for some slight variations in the structure and economy of the different animals whom they affect.\n\nThis complaint sometimes comes on suddenly; but in general it is preceded by symptoms that mark a considerable determination of blood to the head, such as heaviness, drowsiness, insensibility, (see No. 317) occasional fits of giddiness, (see No. 318.) and partial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLINDNESS\">blindness</a>, (see No. 321.) There seems no doubt that the horse is sometimes affected with headache, which appears by the animal's hanging down his head and drooping his ears, by the eyes being dull and watery, by dropping of urine, and coliciveness. These symptoms often precede an attack of apoplexy, though they are sometimes only signs of a disordered stomach.\n\nWhen a fit of flaggers comes on, the animal falls suddenly, and is perhaps convulsed for a few minutes, but more commonly appears quite insensible. The pulse during the fit is usually slower than natural, and much oppressed; the breathing is slow, heavy, and laborious, and there is evidently an increased accumulation of blood in the vessels of the head. The animal remains for a longer or shorter time in the fit, and sometimes he never recovers; but, in general, in eight or ten minutes, the fit goes off, and the animal rises. Sometimes after a fit of the flaggers, the animal appears for a time more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> and lively than before; but very often he remains heavy and sleepy, especially after repeated attacks, and sometimes a paralytic affection of some of the limbs is the consequence of the fit.\n\nApoplexy may be distinguished from inflammation of the brain, by the fever, restlessness, and fiery appearance of the eyes, that never fail to usher in the latter complaint. We would distinguish it from epilepsy, by the foaming at the mouth, and strong convulsions, by which this latter is always accompanied.\n\nAn apoplectic fit may be the consequence of an overloaded or otherwise disordered stomach; and is no uncommon termination of several diseases, as epilepsy, locked jaw, &c. But it is generally the consequence of too much fullness of blood, brought on by a full diet, attended by idleness or want of exercise. It is more common to old than to young animals, especially such as have large heads and short necks. For the immediate and many of the exciting causes of this complaint, see Apoplexy, Medicine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>.\n\nA fit of apoplexy is often produced in an animal that is predisposed to it, by some sudden or violent exertion, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> a heavy load, &c.\n\nThe means of preventing apoplexy when an attack of it is threatened, have been already explained (in No. 317, 318, and 427.) When a fit of apoplexy takes place, if the animal is full of blood, which generally happens, it will be proper to bleed, from the temporal artery, or jugular vein, to an extent proportioned to the state of the animal. If the animal appears weak, bleeding should not be attempted; but the determination of blood to the head may be effectually checked by making pressure upon the carotid artery, taking care at the same time, not to include the jugular veins. Mr Coleman recommends tying up the carotid arteries in dangerous cases of flaggers, and Mr Feron says, that he has often repeated this experiment with success. The bowels should be emptied in the usual manner, as soon as possible; and a strong stimulating clyster should be injected. When the animal comes to himself, if fat and plethoric, he should have a good strong purgative ball, and afterwards some gentle diuretic medicines. He should be kept quiet for some hours after the fit; but when the physic has properly wrought, he should have gentle exercise, which must be gradually increased, according as he is able to bear it; and great care should be taken to keep the bowels open, and to prevent too great an accumulation of blood.\n\n2. Palsy. Paralysis. Thortor-ill, (in sheep.)\n\nThe inferior animals sometimes become paralytic, and we have seen that a palsy in the hind legs is one of the principal symptoms of the distemper in dogs. A paralytic disorder is not uncommon among sheep, and is called by shepherds the thortor-ill. It sometimes arises from their having eaten some poisonous or narcotic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, but is very generally the effect of great weaknesses produced by want of proper nourishment. The best remedy seems to be white vitriol, given three times a day; and the food should be of the most wholesome and nourishing kind.\n\nWe had intended in this chapter to consider pretty much at large, the various cases of suspended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANIMATION\">animation</a>, or apathy, such as drowsiness, hanging, suffocation from fixed air or other noxious gases, and torpor from cold; but this article has already swelled to an unexpected length, and we have yet much important matter on our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>. We must therefore refer our veterinary readers to the article Medicine; as the means to be there directed for restoring suspended animation in man will, with some little modification, apply to similar cases in the domestic animals.\n\nChap. IV. Of Spasmodic Diseases.\n\n1. Locked-Jaw. Tetanus. Stag-evil. Mal de Cerf.\n\nIt has been remarked in No. 10. that horses are extremely subject to the locked-jaw, which proves one of the most obstinate and fatal diseases by which they are affected. It seems also occasionally to appear among cattle, but it occurs to them much less frequently than to horses. We do not know that any writer has described this disease in the horse better than Mr Gibbon, whose description we shall therefore copy, though it is expressed in rather an uncouth style.\n\n\"As soon as a horse is seized in this manner, his head is raised with his nose towards his neck, his ears pricked up, and his tail cocked, looking with an eagerness, as an hungry horse when hay is put down to him, or like an high-spirited one, when upon his mettle; in so much that those who are strangers to such things, when they see a horse stand in this manner, will scarce believe anything of consequence ails him; and I have seen such persons greatly surprised when they have been told of the danger. But they are soon convinced, when they see other symptoms come on apace; that his neck grows...\"\ngrows stiff, cramped, and almost immovable; and if a horse in this condition lives a few days, several knots and ganglions will rise on the tendinous parts thereof; and all the muscles both before and behind, will be so pulled and cramped and stretched, that he looks as if he was nailed to the pavement, with his legs stiff, wide, and straddling; his skin so tight on all parts of his body, that it is almost impossible to move it; and if trial be made to make him walk, he is ready to fall at every step, unless he be carefully supported; his eyes are so fixed with the inaction of the muscles, as gives him a deadness in his looks. He snorts and sneezes often, pants continually with shortness of breath; and this symptom increases till he drops down dead, which generally happens in a few days, unless some very sudden and effectual turn can be given to the distemper.\"\n\nThis disease is generally primary or idiopathic; but it is sometimes symptomatic. The pulse is not always much affected; there is seldom any fever, and the internal functions are seldom impaired till towards the latter stages of the disease.\n\nWe have not many accounts of the appearances that have been discovered on dissecting horses which have died of this disease. In two dissections by M. Huzard, the bowels within the belly, especially the stomach and large intestines, were considerably inflamed; the liver was full of black and fluid blood, and in one case a considerable quantity of blood had escaped into the cavity of the belly; the substance of the liver was very tender, as if it were decomposed or rotten. The other viscera of the belly, and the heart and lungs, were in their natural state. On opening the head, considerable marks of inflammation appeared in the brain, the choroid plexus was distended with blood, and in one case the maxillary and frontal sinuses of the right side were full of black blood; the dura mater was inflamed, and its vessels, as well as those of the brain, were turgid with blood; the ventricles of the brain contained a quantity of serous fluid. In one of the cases the inflammation had extended even to the periosteum on the right side, which was much redder than that on the left.\n\nIt is difficult to say whether the disease depended on an inflammatory affection of the brain, or whether this was the consequence of the violent spasmodic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the muscles during the height of the disease; but we are inclined to think the latter was the case.\n\nInfluences of recovery from this disease in horses are very rare; we shall presently give one from Mr Gibbon, which is rather remarkable. A cautious opinion ought therefore to be given in every case of locked-jaw.\n\nThis affection may be produced by various causes, particularly from wounds, where the nerve is partially divided; from cold, when the body is in a profuse sweat. It may arise also from internal irritation, as from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>, which, in Mr Gibbon's opinion, are a very common cause of it. Probably it more frequently proceeds from wounds, as a puncture in the foot or any other part; and it has certainly often been brought on by the barbarous operations of docking and nicking. There seems no doubt that the brain is the principal seat of the affection.\n\nIn the treatment of locked-jaw, it is necessary to use some vigorous measures as early as possible; but unhappily no method hitherto adopted has proved successful, even in a few cases. Opium, aconite, heliobore, &c., have been tried in the veterinary college in very large doses, but without any beneficial effects. From considering it as a disease of the brain, trepanning has been used, with the view of making pressure on the brain, and this has sometimes appeared to take off the spasm of the muscles; but as soon as the pressure was removed, the spasms returned with nearly equal violence. An infusion of tobacco, to the amount of two pounds, has been given by Mr Coleman, but the symptoms appeared to be aggravated. Mr Feron recommends bleeding, and immerging the animal in a warm bath at 95\u00b0 of Fahrenheit, so as to keep the whole body covered with the water for two or three hours, which he has known to be successful; but the horse must afterwards be clothed and kept very warm. The most probable means to relieve the animal seem to be giving opium in large doses by way of clyster, frequently repeated, and rubbing the whole body frequently with some stimulating liniment, such as oil of turpentine and tincture of cantharides. Mr Blaine recommends a clyster composed of a strong decoction of poppy heads, with two ounces of camphor dissolved in brandy; or if this be thought too expensive, one with two ounces of spirit of hartshorn and four ounces of oil of turpentine, mixed with two or three yolks of eggs, and a pint of ale. The cold bath is found one of the most effectual remedies in the human body, and we should conceive that it is more likely than any other means to do good in the horse; but it will be necessary to rub him as dry as possible after throwing the water over him.\n\nIf it is ascertained that the disease proceeds from a punctured or lacerated wound, it will be proper immediately to secure the wounded part, so as, if possible, completely to divide the affected nerve, as in some cases where this has been done, the spasms have been removed. It must be confessed, however, that even this has frequently failed. If it has proceeded from a punctured wound in the foot, Mr Blaine thinks it advisable to take up the nerves of that foot on each side; for though this might occasion temporary lameness, yet, if the horse were favored, this might be removed in a few weeks.\n\nThe following case related by Mr Gibbon, in his last work on the diseases of horses, is very instructive; even though it should be contended that the cure was effected by nature, and not by Mr Gibbon's remedies.\n\nA young troop horse was suddenly seized with this kind of convulsion, which was first discovered as he was leading out to water, at the afternoon's watering time. \"I happened,\" says Mr Gibbon, \"to be then present, and perceived him come reeling along with his nose turned out, his eyes fixed and immovable, with all the other signs that usually attend this fatal distemper; and when he came to the trough he could not reach the water because of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRAMP\">cramp</a> and stiffness of his neck; and when it was held to him in a pail, could not drink, though he shewed an eagerness for it; his mouth being shut up so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>, that it was scarce possible to put a knife between his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>. When we found it impossible to administer any kind of medicine, till by rubbing his cheeks, jaws, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>, and his whole neck, for a considerable time, we made a shift, with great difficulty, to thrust down part of a calomel ball, on the end of a small stick, and then to put into his nostrils, a very small portion of a strong cephalic drink, thinking by that means...\"\nto convey the ball downwards into his stomach, which however had but little effect, any farther than this, that he had not such sudden fits and agitations as I have seen in others in like circumstances, but continued more quiet; neither did his fever increase, as usually happens when the distemper is gaining ground; but all this while his mouth continued to much fluid, that he could neither eat nor drink for three weeks; only by continually rubbing his jaws and neck, he would sometimes make a shift to suck a handful of scalded bran, or sometimes a little oat-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>, moistened with warm water; but in so small a quantity, that it is possible he might have starved, if other methods had not been taken to keep him alive.\n\n\"I have often observed, that the forcing the jaws open by violent means, puts a horse into such agonies, that it rather increases than abates the symptoms; and therefore I contrived to give him both food and physic by the fundament, through a pipe fourteen inches long, by which he seemed to receive great benefit; for we could perceive the symptoms to abate daily. His flanks grew more quiet, he stood more still, and free from sudden fits and startings; all which symptoms are usual in the continuance and increase of the distemper. The clysters were contrived in the following manner.\n\n\"Rue, pennyroyal, and chamomile flowers, of each a handful; savin and box, of each a handful; garlic, an ounce; caftor and affaefctida, of each half an ounce.\n\n\"In making this clyster, the herbs are to be boiled first, in two quarts of water, in a covered vessel, the space of ten or fifteen minutes, with the caftor and affaefctida cut in small pieces, and tied in a rag; not only to save the caftor from waste, but that it may be squeezed into several clysters. Then the garlic to be added, and continued, close covered, over the fire the space of ten minutes longer; after this the liquor to be poured off into a pan, or any other convenient vessel; then add of linseed oil and treacle, of each four ounces, with half an ounce of unrectified oil of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a>; the treacle and the oils are to be mixed with the decoction, when it is put into the bag.\n\n\"This clyster was repeated once a-day for a fortnight; and by way of diet, was given every day three or four quarts of milk, boiled with oat meal and water, a bag with a long pipe being left in the stable for that purpose. He retained every thing that was administered that way, which he generally fucked up of himself without force. This perhaps was in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> owing to the nature of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> convulsion which causes such irregular motions in the midriff and muscles of respiration, as in some measure inverts the natural motion of the guts; and for the same reason horses in this condition seldom dung, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STALE\">stale</a> often; and when they dung, it drops from them in a manner insensibly, and often no more than one or two balls at a time; and therefore as this horse could receive little or no sustenance by the mouth, I was determined to make trial how far he might receive nourishment by way of injection backwards; whether a thin diluted food thrown into the straight gut, and from thence over into the small guts, by the help of a long pipe, might not find a passage into the blood through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LACTEALS\">lacteals</a>, especially the experiments of this kind made on the human body, both in administering food and physic, particularly in giving the bark, by way of clyster, in agues and intermitting fevers, which has been found successful where the stomach was not able to bear its austerity. It was upon this footing that I treated him in the manner I have described, which I imagined was not altogether without effect; for he scarce ate in three weeks what was sufficient to sustain him one day; so that it was impossible for him to have lived, had he not been supported by what was thrown into his bowels; and though by this means he lost his flesh very sensibly, yet he still retained a good deal of vigour and vivacity. He had two men constantly to look after him, and these relieved by others, who had orders to rub his whole body often, which greatly helped to relax his skin, and remove the crampings of his muscles; and though he had not for the first fortnight recovered the use of his jaws, yet we observed him daily to move with less stiffness, and often to lick in his manger, as if he craved after food. He also breathed with less difficulty, and had several other good signs. This encouraged me to try another experiment with opium, from the known quality of that drug in relaxing the animal fibres; which I therefore thought might be of service to remove the contractions of the muscles about his mouth and jaws, which all this while continued in some measure obstinate, and without some powerful relief, might prove fatal, even though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> cause was in a great measure taken away; therefore I caused an ounce of crude opium to be dissolved in one of his clysters, which was followed with these circumstances, that the horse soon lay down, began to point his ears backwards and forwards, and could move his neck pretty freely, and his mouth was so far at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, that he took his drink with little or no difficulty, and could eat hay and bran sufficient to sustain him. He likewise moved his whole body so readily, that we could walk him an hour every day; and that I might follow what I imagined had been so successfully begun by the opiate clyster, I ordered him some days after an ounce of the common Matthew's pill, which contains about two drachms of opium, and the same quantity of affaefctida, made into a ball, which was given at his mouth, and washed down with a hornful of gruel, which was done with great ease, his mouth being grown pretty pliable. This ball being once more repeated, he recovered daily, being continued for some time in the use of the drinks, which were now administered only twice a-week, with a good rubbing; and as soon as he began to recover his flesh, he was gently purged. By these means he was perfectly cured, without any other ill effect than a blemish upon one eye, caused by the violent and strong contraction of the muscles during the convulsions, which indeed were as bad as any I ever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>, even where they proved the most fatal.\"\n\nWe have related the above case thus particularly, in the author's own words, because we have scarcely ever seen a case of locked-jaw in horses so well described, both as to its progress and treatment. Whatever might have been the cause that produced the complaint in this horse, it was evident that it did not depend upon any congestion of blood in the head, and Gibbon judged very properly in not employing bleeding, purging, and rowels, which appear to have been the indiscriminate practice of farriers in his time; and which might be very proper where the convulsions proceed originally\nDiseases from the head. Gibson says, that he has seen the farriers in such cases put a rowel on each side of the neck, one on the belly, one on the forehead, and one on each side. It appears, however, that this practice meets with but little success, as in this complaint the skin is drawn too tight in all parts that the rowels seldom suppurate kindly, but very commonly produce a mortification, and thus increase the animal's distress.\n\n2. Epilepsy, or Falling-sickness. Convulsions.\n\nWe have already stated our opinion, that several cases that are commonly called flaggers are really instances of epilepsy, and we have no doubt that several strange convulsive disorders that are described as affecting domestic animals may be referred to the same head. Of this kind we consider the skipping complaint among lambs described by Mr Lawrence: \"I remember in former days, (says he), on the borders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUFFOLK\">Suffolk</a>, several flocks of lambs were seized with an uncommon malady, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAPING\">leaping</a> and jumping about the fold-yard in a strange manner; and a dung-heap being raised to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the eaves of a low tiled barn, a number of the lambs ran skipping up to the top of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a>, as though they had been possessed by more devils than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> Magdalen, or even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NUNS\">nuns</a> of Loudun. The whole parish wisely concluded they were bewitched, and a wretched and aged pauper became the object of their suspicions and their deadly hatred. I do not precisely recollect, but I fear the brutal, senseless, and infernal supposed preventive of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITCHCRAFT\">witchcraft</a> was recourse to, burning one of the poor animals alive.\" We should be disposed to account for so many animals being seized with it at once, on the principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>, just as we have seen a number of children at school fall into fits from seeing one of their number affected with epilepsy. The treatment of this complaint must be regulated by the state of the body at the time. If this is plethoric, bleeding, purging, and low diet, will be necessary; if it is weak, a strengthening plan must be adopted.\n\n3. Canine Madness. Hydrophobia. Rabies Canina. La Rage, Fr.\n\nOf this most dreadful malady, the nature of which is so little understood, and of which the cure still remains a desideratum in medicine, the accounts hitherto given are very imperfect.\n\nOur principal object should certainly be to ascertain the origin and progress of the symptoms, as they appear in the dog, in whom the disease appears to originate. The account of these symptoms, as given by different authors, is exceedingly contradictory. The best account that we have seen is that of Meynell of Quorndon in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEICESTERSHIRE\">Leicestershire</a>, and which is published by Dr Arnold in his account of a case of hydrophobia. Before we give Mr Meynell's view of the symptoms, we shall quote a passage from that part of Mr Lawrence's treatise on horses, in which he speaks of canine madness. The passage is as follows: \"The diagnostics of canine madness are, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a> and thirst, without power to eat or drink; trembling, eyes fierce and flaming, hanging of the ears and tail, which is bent inwards; lolling of the tongue, foaming, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARKING\">barking</a> of the dog at his own shadow; panting, running a straight and headless course against anything in his way, biting with violence; other dogs fly him by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a>.\"\n\nBy comparing the above diagnostics with the following account of Mr Meynell's, it will be seen how little dependence is to be placed on the description of those who have not written from their own actual observation. We doubt not that Mr Lawrence derives his account from what he conceived to be the best information, and he is therefore not accountable for his errors.\n\nAccording to Mr Meynell, the first symptom of canine madness in dogs appears to be a failure of appetite in a small degree, that is, the dog does not eat count of his usual food with his usual eagerness, though, if better food be offered him, he may eat it greedily. A disposition to quarrel with other dogs comes on early in the disease. A total loss of appetite generally succeeds, though dogs sometimes eat and lap water the day before their death, which generally happens between seven and ten days after the first symptoms have appeared. A mad dog will not cry out on being struck, or show any sign of fear on being threatened; though he will, very late in the disease, appear sensible of kind treatment. A mad dog, in the height of the disorder, has a disposition to bite all other dogs, animals, or men. When not provoked, he usually attacks only such as come in his way; but having no fear, it is peculiarly dangerous to strike at or provoke him.\n\nMad dogs appear to be capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> the infection early in the disorder, and as soon as they begin to quarrel with and bite other dogs.\n\nThe eyes of mad dogs do not look red or fierce, but dull, and have a peculiar appearance, which is easily distinguished by such as have been used to observe it, but which is not easy to be described.\n\nMad dogs never bark, but occasionally utter a most dismal and plaintive howl, expressive of extreme distress, and which they who have once heard can never forget. So that dogs may be known to be going mad without being seen, when only this dismal howl is heard from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENNEL\">kennel</a>.\n\nMad dogs do not foam or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROTH\">froth</a> at the mouth, but their lips and tongue appear dry and foul or slimy.\n\nMad dogs are generally sufficiently sensible to know those to whom they have been accustomed.\n\nMr Meynell is confident that dread of water is not a symptom of this disease in dogs.\n\nThough mad dogs generally refuse both food and drink, in the latter stage of the disorder, yet they never show any abhorrence or dread of water, will pass through it without difficulty, and lap it eagerly to the last. But it is remarkable, that though they will lap water for a long time, and eagerly, and do not seem to experience any uneasiness from it, yet they do not appear to swallow a single drop of it; for however long they may continue lapping it, no diminution of quantity can be perceived.\n\nHe has never known a dog shew symptoms of the disease in less time after the bite than ten days; and he has known many instances of dogs having died mad as late as eight months after the bite. The symptoms generally appear between three and eight weeks after the bite.\n\nA dog had been bitten, and confined by accident,\nand not from any suspicion of danger, for a whole year, so as to have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with any other dog all the time; and went mad at the end of that period.\n\nMr Meynell makes the following additional observations. \"I am persuaded that the disorder never originates from hot weather, putrid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, or from any other cause but the bite. For however dogs may have been confined, however fed, or whatever may have been the heat of the season, I never knew the disorder commence, without being able to trace it to that cause; and it was never introduced into the kennel but by the bite of a mad dog. I do not say that I am certain that the disorder never originated from any cause except the bite; but I say that I never knew a dog go mad that I had no reason to believe had been bitten.\n\n\"Some dogs, in the last stage of the disorder, have a locked jaw.\n\n\"I do not recollect ever to have heard a dog bark after I have perceived symptoms of madness upon him.\n\n\"I consider an unusual disposition to quarrel with other dogs as a certain sign of beginning madness; and it is the only one I know.\n\n\"I believe the disorder always comes on so gradually that mischief may be prevented by proper care.\n\n\"I believe after symptoms have ever appeared, they never go entirely off; and that the disease, though sometimes very slow in its progress, always terminates in death.\n\n\"Dogs known to have been bitten frequently escape, but I believe not near so frequently as men.\n\n\"Almost all the mad dogs that I have seen have been confined.\n\n\"The hair of a mad dog do not stand erect more than those of other dogs.\n\n\"I do not know that there is anything remarkable in the manner of a mad dog's carrying his head or his tail.\n\n\"I do not know that there is anything fierce in the appearance of the eyes of a mad dog. I believe I should know a mad dog to be mad from the appearance of his eyes, but I cannot describe this appearance.\n\n\"I do not know that a dog in the beginning of this disorder, is disposed to sneak away growling, or to flun the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of other dogs; but if I observed any thing particular in the manner of a dog, I should certainly confine him.\n\n\"I do not believe that dogs are more afraid of a mad dog than they are of any other dog that seems disposed to attack them.\"\n\n(Mr Daniel was witness to an instance of this innate dread of a mad dog in other dogs, at Bradwell in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSEX\">Essex</a>, where he was hunting with the reverend H. Bate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUDLEY\">Dudley</a>. Mr Dudley walked his hounds to the water to swim them; he had himself swam over to an island about a hundred yards from the shore, and most of the hounds had followed him, but some of them could not be compelled to do so. At this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a> an alarm of a mad dog was given, who had been pursued many miles, and done variety of mischief in his progress; he seized one of the hounds that would not go into the water, and the remainder to the number of seven or eight immediately upon his approach to them, took to the water and swam across to those in the island.*)\n\n\"There are two kinds of madness, both of which I have known to originate from the bite of the same dog. Among houndsmen, one is known by the name of raging the other by that of dumb madness. In dumb madness, the nether jaw drops, and fixes; the tongue hangs out of the mouth, and slaver drops from it. In raging madness, I believe the mouth is shut, except when the dog snaps or howls, and that no moisture drops from it.\"*\n\nThe following facts and observations upon the consequences of the madness among <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> Fitzwilliam's hounds, perhaps mark the attack and symptoms of this disorder more accurately than any other description of a similar accident.\n\nIn the night of the 8th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1791, the man who slept in the kennel was unusually disturbed by the hounds fighting; he got up to quiet them several times, and always found the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HOUND\">hound</a> quarrelling. Noticing the riotous behaviour of this particular hound, and at the same time an appearance of stupidity in him, he was induced to suppose that he was going mad, and accordingly confined him in a place by himself, after which the pack was quiet the remainder of the night. When the huntsman came to the kennel in the morning, he was told what passed, and the supposed mad hound thrown to him; his appearance was suspicious; some meat was given to him, part of which he ate, although there was an apparent difficulty in swallowing. Two days passed in suspense; but at the end of the third, his disorder was confirmed; and at the end of the fifth day he died mad. Immediate preparations were made for confining 42 couple of hounds separately, until the month of September, which was rigidly adhered to. By this means, Mr Hopkinson, a medical gentleman of Peterborough had an opportunity wherein he very skilfully and exactly minutely the symptoms and progress of this disease.\n\nSix hounds went mad in the following order.\n\n| No | Attacked       | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">Date</a>          |\n|----|---------------|---------------|\n| 1  | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1st      |               |\n| 2  | August 3rd    |               |\n| 3  | September 3rd  |               |\n| 4  | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DITTO\">Ditto</a> 4th     |               |\n| 5  | November 10th  |               |\n| 6  | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 8th   |               |\n\nThe hounds were first taken from their chains in September, and exercised for about half an hour together, not more than four or five couple at a time, and not trusted out of the sight of the attendant. When this exercise was over, they were again confined separately, and fed at separate troughs. In the beginning of October, they were taken out ten couple at a time; at the latter end of that month, twenty couple; still observing the same caution with respect to separate confinement after they returned from exercise. In the beginning of November they were hunted, but were chained up, as at first, after hunting, until the third week of that month, when they were let loose in different apartments of one, two, three, four, and five couple together. This regulation was continued till the month of June 1792, as the huntsman, who has had much experience in this disease did not deem them safe under a year.\n\nThe only remedy employed was mercurial ointment; and all the hounds, except the bitches that were in whelp,\nwhelp, underwent two frictions, so as to produce in some of them a violent salivation.\n\nMr Hopkinfon remarks, that from the above statement it seems that the disorder is as virulent, as to the power of inoculation (by which process it is always communicated) at its commencement, as at the advanced stage of it; for all the six dogs that went mad were probably infected on the 8th of June, within a few hours of each other.\n\nIt is a common opinion, that when a dog is bitten by one that is mad, a few weeks confinement, tea-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a>, or the popular nostrums, are either of them sufficient to prevent his taking the disease, and from spreading its mischievous effects; but in this case, there was a fair opportunity of proving that there is no security after six months, perhaps not after twelve; that mercury has no certain power to prevent it; and it appears that the huntman had repeatedly employed all the popular remedies, without any effect whatever. He had also observed nearly the same progress of the disease in several packs of hounds, where no expense had been spared, for every medicine in use, tea-bathing &c. In the present instance, there was this remarkable difference, that no internal medicine had been given, and the huntman never knew fewer hounds attacked with the disease.\n\nThe result of the huntman's experience in the preventive plan is therefore in favour of a separate confinement; for whenever he had depended on medicine, and not on the above plan of treatment, the disease had made dreadful havoc.\n\nThere is reason to suppose that the hound which first went mad, was not bitten by any other dog, but that it was in him a spontaneous disease. The whole pack were examined very attentively, and bites found upon four couple, one of which was seen fighting with the mad hound twice; he underwent a longer confinement than the rest: however, none of them were attacked by the disease, and it is singular that no bites were discovered upon the six hounds that went mad. The infection taking place or not, is therefore perhaps the result of chance; yet, although no bites were perceived upon the hounds which went mad, there is every ground to conclude they were bitten, but that the wounds being small, were concealed by the hair. Mr Daniel suggests, that most probably there were bites within side of the lips, or jaws, where the venomous saliva might be more fatally and quickly absorbed into the habit, than where the teeth had to penetrate through the thick outer skin of the dog.\n\nMr Hopkinfon continues his remarks with respect to the symptoms of madness in dogs, and states that those which distinguish the attack of the hydrophobia, are in general a loathing of food, although this is not universal, as they will sometimes eat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> food, but refuse liquid. The first and only symptom that No. 3, had of the disease, was eating his own excrement when food stood by him; the feeder knowing this to be contrary to what the dog would do if he were well, he immediately confined him. For a day or two he was in some doubt whether his suspicions were well founded; but he proved right, for the dog died raving mad upon the fifth day.\n\nAt the commencement of the disorder, the mad dog has a particular tendency (if loose) to lick and smell the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENIS\">penis</a> and fundament of another dog; this should be looked upon as a very suspicious symptom. The huntman speaks of this as an almost never failing one.\n\nThere seems for the first two or three days, to be intervals of rest; and during that time they usually recognize their master, their eyes look clear and well, their tongues moist, and of the proper colour; but if a dog is loose at this time, he will in general bite everything he meets with. He will sometimes, during this stage of the disease, leave his home for several hours, spread his disorder by biting men and beasts, and return home again. The mad dog, when confined, seldom survives the fifth day from the first attack; if suffered to run about, there is reason to believe his death is hastened by a day or two. At the end of the third or fourth day, his appearance is much altered, his eyes are sunk, his tongue black and dry, he makes horrid howlings, and seems much disturbed; indeed the concluding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> is dreadful to witness. In the first stage of the canine madness, it is difficult for a person not conversant with the disposition of dogs in general, and of the mad dog in particular, to ascertain whether the dog is really mad or not; even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Fitzwilliam's huntman was doubtful for a day or two respecting the hound mentioned in this account, as being the first attacked with the disease; however, in the advanced stage of it, no one can be mistaken.\n\nIt is the generally received opinion, that mad dogs will not take the water; but in the summer of 1791, there occurred in the neighbourhood of Peterborough, two instances of mad dogs, when closely pursued, swimming a large navigable river. A doubt might have arisen, as to their being mad, but that two hogs went mad from the bite of one, and the other was pursued for many miles by Lord Fitzwilliam's huntman, who, from his experience in the disease, was not likely to be mistaken. Both Rural dogs completely swam the river.*\n\nOf all the remedies that have been employed for the cure of this dreadful disorder, none seems to likely to be successful as the cold bath. This remedy was recommended about 200 years ago by the Seigneur d'Elparron, in his \"Fauconnerie,\" and he gives a curious instance of its success in the cure of a mad dog. \"I will relate, (says he) what happened to a gentleman of my acquaintance. He discovered that some of his dogs had been bitten by a mad dog; and after some time, several of them betrayed symptoms of the disease. These he ordered to be killed; but it happened that one which was a great favourite was seized, and he desired his servant to throw him into the river. By chance, the dog in coming up from the bottom, got entangled in the roots of a tree by the cord with which he had been tied, but in such a manner that his nose just remained above the water. In this situation he remained for three days, at the end of which period he got loose and returned to the house, to the great astonishment of his master; and here I afterwards saw him, as cheerful and healthy as before. I have no doubt (continues d'Elparron) that if mad dogs could be plunged into water without danger of their biting, they would all recover; and I believe that if the same practice were pursued with men, which might easily be done, many an unfortunate wretch might be saved. The danger of being bitten might be prevented by first putting a muzzle on the animal, and he might then be retained.\"\ntained in the water, as long as may be judged prudent or necessary.\"\n\nAnother writer, Defouilloux, who published a work on hunting in 1583, recommends plunging into salt-water such dogs as have been bitten, for the purpose of preserving them from the effects of the disease.\n\nAs the effect of remedies when the complaint once appears is so uncertain, it should be our principal object to use all the preventive means in our power. When, therefore, it is discovered that an animal has been bitten by one that is mad, the wounded part should immediately be cut out, where this can be done with safety, or at least should be deeply scarified to the very bottom of the bite. The wound should then be repeatedly washed with soap and water, or with a solution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SODA\">soda</a> poured upon it in a stream from a considerable height; and afterwards the wound should be seared to the bottom with a hot iron; or where this cannot conveniently be done, a quantity of aquafortis, or oil of vitriol, should be poured into it, so as to destroy all the remains of the virus or poison. If the part bitten be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>, it should be cut off and seared. After these means, it will be proper to plunge the animal once a day into cold water, or where convenient into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>; and he should be strictly watched, that if these means should have proved unsuccessful, the earliest appearance of the disease may be perceived.\n\nDr Arnold, to whom we are indebted for Mr Meynell's account of the symptoms of madness in dogs, gives the following advice with respect to the method of treating a dog that is suspected of being mad.\n\n\"Though every dog that is bitten does not receive the disorder, yet, as the time of its appearance after the bite is so very uncertain, and as a great proportion of those that are bitten do actually receive it, and as there is no criterion by which we can ascertain whether a dog has or has not received the infection, but the breaking out of the disorder, it is earnestly to be wished, that all owners of dogs would immediately destroy, or secure for a great length of time, every dog known, or but suspected, to have been bitten by a mad dog.\n\n\"It is also earnestly to be wished, that all persons possessing dogs would immediately tie up or destroy such of their dogs, whether known to be bitten or not, as shall begin to be disordered in any way, of which the nature and cause is not perfectly obvious; and especially if there be the smallest reason to suspect that the dog was bitten, and that the disorder is really an incipient madness.\n\n\"It is still more to be wished that they would immediately destroy all dogs known to be in any stage of madness, if it be at the same time known that they have not yet bitten any other animal, and particularly no person whatsoever; and that no dog that has bitten any animal or person be destroyed as a mad dog if it can be avoided, but that every dog be secured and tied up, that it may be certainly known whether he be mad or not. If he has the symptoms of confirmed madness, they will plainly discover themselves, and he will die in ten days and less; if he is not, he may be safely enlarged in the space of a fortnight, and the person bitten will be freed from the most distressing apprehensions.\"\n\nBefore we dismiss the subject of canine madness, it will be expected that we should take some notice of the operation of worming dogs, so celebrated among huntmen and breeders of dogs, as a supposed preventive of this dreadful malady. This operation is as old as the days of Pliny, and has ever since been more or less esteemed among the vulgar. But neither the operation itself, nor its effect, seem to have been well understood. The idea of a worm being lodged in the tongue of the puppy, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a> of which is to prevent the animal from going mad, is truly ridiculous; and such has been deservedly laughed at by sensible people in all ages. But though it is neither a worm that is extracted, nor is the extraction a preventive of madness, it seems, however, pretty well ascertained, that the performing of this operation is productive of considerable advantage, in preventing the dog from doing mischief, even though he should run mad. It seems, that in dogs who have been wormed, and are afterwards seized with hydrophobia, the tongue swells to such a degree as to prevent the animal from closing his jaws upon the object which he attempts to bite. The following observations of a late ingenious and entertaining writer on the subject are entitled to much attention.\n\nVery strong proofs have been adduced of its utility; nor is it natural to imagine, that so easy and effective an operation would have been omitted, had no more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> been attributed to it than it really possesses; and, wherein it failed, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> prevention of madness was said to be the consequence; whereas the fact was and is, that taking out the worm hath nothing to do with annihilating the disorder, although it will most certainly hinder the dog, seized with it, from doing any hurt to man or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a>. A late author affirms, he had three dogs that were wormed, bit by mad dogs at three several periods, yet, notwithstanding they all died mad, they did not bite to do any mischief, that being determined to make a full experiment, he shut one of the dogs up in a kennel, and put to him a dog he did not value; the mad dog often run at the other to bite him, but his tongue so swelled, that he could not make his teeth meet. The dog was kept in the kennel until the mad one died, and was purposely preserved for two years afterwards, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> the effect, but he never ailed anything; although no remedies were applied to check any infection that might have been received from the contact of the mad dog.\n\nMr Daniel has had various opportunities of proving the usefulness of worming, and infers three of the most striking instances, under the hope of inducing its general practice.\n\nA terrier bitch went mad that was kept in the kennel with 40 couple of hounds: not a single one was bitten, nor was the feen to offer to bite. The bitch being of peculiar fort, every attention was paid to her, and the gradations of the disease (which were extremely rapid) minutely noted. The hydrophobia was fast approaching before she was separated from the hounds, and she died the second day after. At first warm milk was placed before her, which she attempted to lap, but the throat refused its functions; from this period she never tried to eat or drink, seldom rose up, or even moved; the tongue swelled very much, and long before her death the jaws were distended by it.\n\nA spaniel was observed to be seized by a strange dog, and was bit in the lip; the servant who ran up to\nDiseases, part them, narrowly escaped, as the dog twice flew at him; a few minutes after the dog had quitted the yard, the people who had pursued gave notice of the dog's madness, who had made terrible havoc in a course of ten miles from whence he had set off. The spaniel was a great favourite, had medicine applied, and every precaution taken; upon the fourteenth day he appeared to loathe his food, and his eyes looked unusually heavy; the day following he endeavoured to lap milk, but could fowllow none; from that time the tongue began to fwell, he moved himself but seldom, and on the third day he died. For many hours previous to his death, the tongue was so enlarged, that the fangs or canine teeth could not meet each other by upwards of an inch.\n\nThe hounds were some years after parted with, and were sold in lots. A madness broke out in the kennel of the gentleman who purchased many of them; and although several of these hounds were bitten and went mad, only one of them ever attempted to bite, and that was a hound from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Portland's, who, in the operation of worming, had the worm broke by his struggling, and was so troublesome that one half of it was suffered to remain; the others all died with symptoms similar to the terrier and spaniel, viz. a violent swelling of the tongue, and a stupor rendering them nearly motionless, and both which symptoms seemed to increase with the disease.\n\nThe idea that worming prevents a dog from receiving the infection when bitten should be exploded; but the foregoing facts show how far it may be recommended for the prevention of a malady horrid in its effects where a human being is concerned, and which to the sportsman and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> is attended with such dangerous and expensive consequences.\n\nWe cannot pretend to say, what it is that the worms of dogs take away from the tongue; but we cannot suppose, that Mr Daniel, though he calls it a worm, really believes that it is so. The following are his directions for performing the operation.\n\n\"The worming of whelps should be previous to their being sent out to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>; this operation is to be performed with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANCET\">lancet</a>, to slit the thin skin which immediately covers the worm; a small awl is then to be introduced under the centre of the worm, to raise it up; the further end of the worm will with very little force make its appearance, and with a cloth taking hold of that end, the other will be drawn out easily. Care must be taken that the whole of the worm comes away without breaking; and it rarely breaks, unless cut into by the lancet, or wounded by the awl.\"*\n\n4. Colic. Colica. Spasmodic* or Flatulent Colic, Gripes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATS\">Bats</a>, Trot, or Gullion. Tranch\u00e9e, Fr.\n\nThis is one of the most painful disorders with which horses are affected; and it seems to occasion them as much distress as inflammation in the bowels, with which it is very commonly confounded by ordinary farriers.\n\nIn this disease the horse expresses his pain, by frequently lying down and rolling on his back, and after having remained a short time in this position, starting up again. The hair is staring, and there are sometimes cold sweats. He frequently makes attempts to flake, looks anxiously at his flanks, and sometimes strikes his belly with his hind feet. There is seldom any fever in this disease; and when it does occur, it is only after the disease has existed for some time. The pulse is seldom affected; but when the pain is very great, it is a little quicker than natural. The belly commonly feels hard and tense. Colic is almost always accompanied with coliciveness, though gripping pains not unfrequently attend severe scouring.\n\nIf the above symptoms are attentively examined, they will commonly serve to distinguish this disease from inflammation of the bowels. It is generally observed, that the pain in colic returns only at intervals, and the extremities are seldom cold. It must not be overlooked however, that when colic continues for a considerable time, it may terminate in inflammation, so that the distinguishing symptoms mentioned here and in No. 497, are to be depended on, only in the early stage of the disease.\n\nCattle are extremely subject to colic; but it is said to be more common in young than in old cattle. The symptoms do not differ from what we have described, only that it is laid, that these animals, when affected with gripes, strike their heads and horns against everything in their way.\n\nColic is easily removed, when the proper remedies are employed, before any symptoms of inflammation make their appearance; but if the remedies be delayed till inflammation takes place, the cure is very precarious.\n\nColic is very commonly the consequence of neglected coliciveness, and by this it is always increased. It may be ascribed to improper food, especially such as is apt to produce flatulence or sourness in the stomach or bowels; by drinking cold water immediately after eating; and by exposure to cold, during violent sweating.\n\nAs it is not always easy to distinguish flatulent colic from inflammation, it is the safest plan to begin the treatment by bleeding, to the extent of three or four English quarts; and the appearance of the blood will generally inform us whether it will be necessary to repeat the operation. See No. 162. The next circumstance to be attended to, is the evacuation of the bowels by back-raking and softening clysters. In general, after this operation, a large quantity of air will be evacuated, and considerable relief will be afforded. After these means have been employed, some stimulating aromatics, such as oil of turpentine, oil of aniseed, essence of peppermint, or some of the other stimulants enumerated in No. 285, and 286, should be given by the mouth; and if these do not procure relief, it will be proper to give a ball containing half an ounce of calomel, and immediately after it, a drench of peppermint water, with five or six drachms of laudanum. The cure will be considerably assisted by rubbing the belly gently with a warm cloth; and the animal should be gently trotted, for a considerable time, while led by the halter. Warm fomentations to the belly have been recommended; but if there is a considerable accumulation of air in the stomach and bowels, these would do harm by increasing the expansion of the air, and thus adding to the animal's distress; for it must be remembered, that a horse cannot easily belch up wind by the mouth; and where there is any obstruction backwards, everything that can increase the expansion...\nexpansion of the confined air, must do harm. On the contrary, every thing that is capable of diminishing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of air, may probably relieve the pain. It might be worth while to try how far the application of cold to the belly would be attended with advantage; and this might easily and safely be effected, by bathing the belly with strong spirit of wine, which speedily evaporating, will considerably diminish the temperature of the belly. It will be proper, where the disease continues obstinate, to administer warm softening clysters, every hour or two; as well for the purpose of obviating colic, as for removing the spasmodic contraction of the bowels. We are assured, that where most other means have failed, of procuring relief in flatulent colic, this has been obtained by means of the smoke of tobacco drawn up the fundament. The simplest way of administering this remedy, is to introduce the small end of a tobacco pipe, after having filled the bowl and lighted it; when the smoke will infallibly be drawn up by the action of the horse's bowels.\n\n**Chap. V. Of Dropical Disease.**\n\nOur domestic animals are sometimes affected with dropy; and this may be either diffused through the cellular membrane below the skin; or the water may be contained within one or more of the cavities, as the head, the chest, and the belly.\n\nExternal dropy, or what medical writers call <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANA\">ana</a>-farca, and farriers water farcy, is not common, unless it accompanies a dropical collection within the body. It sometimes affects particular parts, as the legs, the throat, or the lips; and at other times it is diffused over the whole cellular membrane. It is known by the swelling of the part, which is cold, and retains the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of the finger for some time. The urine is generally more sparing and of a deeper colour than is natural; and the animal appears considerably weak. This disease, when it has proceeded to any considerable height, and when the animal is much debilitated, is not easily removed; but when it is slight, and of no long standing, it will in general yield to remedies.\n\nAll the species of dropy more commonly affect old than young animals; and such as are debilitated by any previous cause, are more subject to it. It is said that horses are more likely to become dropical in spring and autumn when they are moulting.\n\nThe cure of general dropy is to be attempted by the use of diuretic medicines, accompanied with a nourishing diet, gentle exercise, and frequent friction all over the body, especially over those parts where the accumulation of fluid is situated. The action of the diuretics must be assisted by a sufficient quantity of drink; and it will be proper to give the animal some of the more powerful strengthening remedies, such as white vitriol, oak bark, logwood, &c.\n\n1. **Dropy of the Head. Hydrocephalus. Sturdy. Turnfick.**\n\nDropy of the head seldom affects horses or cattle; but a peculiar collection of water in the head is very common among sheep, in whom it is called the Sturdy, or Turnfick. One of the best accounts of this disease that we have seen is that which is given in the second appendix to Mr Findlater's survey of Peebles, which we shall give nearly in the words of the author.\n\nThis disease is peculiarly incident to young sheep, or hogs, of a year or eighteen months old. It consists of a collection of water generally formed upon the external surface of the brain, immediately below the skull; and sometimes, though not often, in the center or ventricles of the brain. When the water forms in the last mentioned parts, we apprehend it is almost universally mortal.\n\nThe disorder is first discovered, by the animal not keeping up with the rest of the flock, and by its appearing dull and stupid. It is afterwards observed to go round in a giddy manner; and at length it appears <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a>, and the pupil of the eye seems wide and relaxed. It may continue a long time in this situation before it dies; and it is believed that sheep sometimes recover of this disease without any thing being done for them. They are often in good order when they die, as they continue to feed tolerably well, until near the last period. Though some recover, with or without means, perhaps it may be most advisable to kill them early in the disease, provided they be in good order, as this local temper does not affect the goodness of the mutton.\n\nWhen the collection of water is on the outside of the brain, it is often cured by thrusting a sharp wire up the animal's nostrils, until it reaches the water, and opens a passage for it to run off. In other cases, it is cured by an operation which some shepherds perform very dexterously. The water is contained in a bladder, or vehicle, (a hydatid) generally about the size of a walnut. The part of the skull immediately above where it is situated, feels softer than other parts. This the shepherd discovers, by pressing with his thumb and fingers, upon different parts of the fore and upper parts of the skull. The bone here has become thinner, and feels soft; from which he is certain that the watery collection is formed.\n\nAfter the disease has gone on a considerable time, and he judges it ripe for the operation, he raises the scalp, and lays the bone bare to a sufficient breadth, with a sharp knife; he then discovers more accurately the extent of the thin soft part of the bone, and with a strong and sharp-pointed knife, he makes a circular incision in the skull, raises up, and takes out the part. He then sees the clear thin bladder underneath, which he lays hold of with a small hook, or the point of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a>, and gently draws it out; taking all possible care that it be not broken, or the water spilled, which would prove unfavourable to recovery. He finds a considerable hollow in the brain where the bag was situated, over which he brings the flap of skin that was raised, so as to cover it as neatly as possible. Over the whole he applies a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a> of tar, and leaves the rest to nature. This operation frequently proves successful.\n\nMr Findlater remarks, that in Tweeddale, one case in three, where a perforation is made by the pointed wire, or the trepan, usually ends favourably. Of late it has been the custom among the shepherds of that district, to bore into the skull of sheep affected with the sturdy, with a common gimlet; and however rough or apparently dangerous the operation, it seems frequently to prove successful. The perforation is made by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BORING\">boring</a> from the root of the nostril, in an oblique direction.\n2. Water in the Chest. Hydrothorax.\n\nThis complaint appears but seldom in the inferior animals; but it may take place from excessive debility; and according to Mr Blaine, it is sometimes the consequence of inflammation in the lungs. Here however this writer is probably mistaken, and confounds water in the chest with empyema, or a collection of matter within the chest, which is not an uncommon termination of pneumonia.\n\nWhen dropy in the chest does occur, the animal labours under a difficulty of breathing, especially when lying down; and the pulse is feeble, and commonly irregular. The urine is scanty and high coloured. If the collection of water is pretty considerable, it may be perceived by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> that is produced, when the chest is struck with the hand; but this is often a deceitful sign, and should not be tried till a long time after the animal has drunk; as, for some time after drinking, the water that remains in the stomach will, when the ribs are struck, produce a sound that might lead us to suppose there was water in the chest.\n\nThis complaint commonly proves fatal, both in man and animals, and probably there is no means of cure except by evacuating the water, by an opening into the chest; an operation which is always precarious, and commonly as dangerous as the disease which it is intended to relieve. If it is determined however to try the experiment, the opening should be made between the seventh and eighth rib, near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> bone, on that side of the chest where the water is supposed to be accumulated. In making the opening, the skin should be drawn tight towards the edge of the seventh rib; when a cut is to be made in the place above directed, with a sharp knife, not cutting too boldly, but rather scratching with the point of the knife, till the skin and the muscles are completely divided. After this, a pipe must be introduced through the opening, and fastened by a bandage round the animal; some soft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> or a piece of sponge being placed over the opening, after as much water as possible has run off, to suck up the remaining moisture, and exclude the air.\n\n3. Water in the Belly. Ascites.\n\nThis is the most common species of dropy, and is known by the general symptoms of dropy that have been described in No. 319. and 320., attended with an unusual swelling of the belly; while the skin is cold, and very tight. When the belly is struck with one hand, while the other is held upon the opposite side, a fluctuation may be perceived, much more distinctly than in the last species.\n\nIt is brought on by the usual causes of dropy that we have already mentioned, and is not an uncommon consequence of jaundice and other chronic disorders. It is not quite so dangerous as dropy in the chest, but it is very apt to return after having been removed.\n\nThe treatment should be begun with diuretics, and now and then a mercurial purge, while the body is strengthened by tonic medicines, nourishing diet, and gentle exercise. If the accumulation of water becomes very great, it may be easily evacuated, by making a puncture into the belly, and introducing a pipe as in the last case. Mr Lawrence has gone into the mistake generally committed, of supposing that little drink should be given in cases of dropy. It is now well ascertained that moderate drinking considerably increases the efficacy of diuretic medicines.\n\nChap. VI. Of Anomalous Diseases.\n\n1. Diabetes. Profuse Staling, or Pissing-evil.\n\nIt sometimes happens, that horses or cattle make a much greater quantity of urine than is natural; so that the quantity evacuated exceeds the quantity of fluid drunk by the animal. Probably this disease occurs more frequently among cattle than among horses, though it is scarcely mentioned by the writers on cattle medicine, and the account that is given of it by veterinary writers is extremely imperfect. Mr Blaine describes the urine, as being five or six times the natural quantity, as milky or watery, and depositing a sediment which has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and appearance of sugar. As we have never observed a case of this disease in horses or cattle, we cannot say how far this description of the urine is correct; but if the urine evacuated by these animals in diabetes resembles the human urine in the same disease, it is clear and almost colourless, has the smell and taste of honey, deposits little sediment, but on being evaporated, leaves a thick substance like treacle.\n\nConsiderable thirst accompanies this disease; and when it has continued long, the animal becomes extremely weak and emaciated. The skin is usually dry and harsh, the pulse is small and quick, and the appetite in the early part of the disease is much increased.\n\nThis complaint commonly proves fatal; few instances of a recovery having been observed in man; and we do not know that any successful case in any of the domestic animals is on record.\n\nThe causes of diabetes are very obscure, especially in the inferior animals; it seems to be the consequence of great weakness, and some unusual action of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGESTIVE\">digestive</a> organs. The various theories that have been given in explanation of this disease, as far as relates to the human body, will be noticed in the article Medicine and if we shall meet with an opportunity of examining the disease in horses or cattle, we will endeavour to give a more accurate account of it, under Veterinary Art.\n\nIn the treatment of diabetes in horses, &c., the method proposed by Dr Rollo for the cure of this disease in man, has been recommended, and we believe adopted, by Mr Coleman; with what success we cannot say. This method consists in making the animal obtain as much as possible from vegetable food; and giving him broth and balls made of flesh, mixed up with paste of wheat flour. He should have as little drink as possible. Astringent remedies are commonly employed in these cases, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAPAN\">Japan</a> earth, alum, white vitriol, muriate of iron, oak bark. See receipts, No. 29.\n\n2. Black-Quarter, Quarter-Ill, or Black Spald.\n\nThere is a disease that proves very fatal in some districts to calves or cattle of a year to two old, the nature of which is little understood, but it seems nearly allied.\nMr Lawrence considers the disease as appearing under various forms, to which he gives the following names; blood in the legs, or crateuch; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLAIN\">blain</a> in the tongue, or overflow of blood; shrinking-in, or rising of the blood; higham, or iron-fricking; joint murrain, or garget; black quarter; quarter-evil; black leg.\n\nWe have given as a synonym the name of black spald, because we consider the disease so called in Scotland, as nearly, if not entirely, the same with the black quarter of the writers on cattle medicine. As we have not seen the disease, we call copy what Mr Lawrence says of it, in his treatise on cattle.\n\n\"All our animals, oxen, sheep, and pigs, I have observed, are subject to sanguineous effusion or overflow of the blood, on being put in a low and weak state, to rich or succulent keep. They very commonly drop on a sudden, and die in the blood, as it is termed; when the carcases putrefy almost immediately, and are totally lost. Pigs which die in this way, have their skins so universally suffused with the blood, that they appear enveloped, or rather shrouded in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOROCCO\">Morocco</a> leather. In oxen, chiefly young cattle, nature commonly finds a vent for the disease, in an eruption on the leg, quarter, or shoulder, attended with pneumatisis or a collection of air in the cellular membrane, or, as it is commonly termed, between the flesh and the skin; whence the crepitating or crackling noise, which is heard on pressure. Another termination of the disease, is, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> of matter upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>, whence the term of joint garget or murrain. I know not whether I am correct in referring the crateuch to this class, which is said, in Scotland, to be a swelling and lameness in the legs; but the old writers particularly mention blood in the legs. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLANE\">Blane</a> or garget in the tongue, attended with inflammation and vehicles or bladders in that part, is said to be a symptom of the disease, and also to arise from heat and fatigue.\n\n\"This disease has swept off great numbers of yearling and two-year-old cattle, and become indeed endemic in certain districts, where any such scourge was unknown, it is said, previously to the introduction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> grasses, with the full feeding on which the animals become surfeited: thus the improvident use of good produces evil. The breeders being alarmed at the ravages occasioned by this murrain, which generally carried off the forwardest and best of the cattle, no wonder that the fertile brains of cow-doctors, were put into intestine motion, and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of the favourite engines, the knife or fire, were whirled uppermost. In effect, some skilful leech introduced the following most extraordinary operation, as a preventive of the disease in question; which I apprehend in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a>, either of physiology or common-senseology, could have no better prophylactic or preventive view, than shaving the animal would have; which I beg leave to recommend in the stead, as at least free from cruelty. The ill-starred beast is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>, bound to a stake, all his four legs are cut open from the claws upwards to the height of several inches, in order to find among the tendons and ligaments a strong blood vessel of a bluish colour, which said offending vessel, guilty of the original sin of producing joint murrain, being caught with a crooked needle, is cut away. It is great pity, for the sake of hypothetical uniformity, that the above-aid blue blood-vessel had not been called a worm, since the brains of so many of our cattle folk have been infested with worms from very high antiquity**.\n\nAfter much jocose, but rather coarse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> of methods that have been proposed for the cure of this disease, Mr Lawrence thus proceeds. \"Prevention of this malady is the only cure worth notice: because, after the attack, the very nature of the case renders all remedy either uncertain, or of very little profit, even if successful, on account of the expense of time and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>. With this view the young cattle must not be pushed too far in condition; and indeed the same precaution may be useful in some degree, with respect to the full aged. A piece of short or inferior keep should be reserved, as a digesting place, in which the cattle may be occasionally turned to empty and exercise themselves. Those observed to advance very fast may be bled monthly for several months: of the efficacy of which practice, however, I have by no means so good an opinion as that of giving medicines which prevent internal obstruction. I am well aware of the difficulty, or rather total impracticability, of such measures with a number of cattle in the field, or I am convinced, that occasional purges, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> medicines, would prevent those diseases which seem to take their rise in over repletion and accumulation. Six drachms daily, of equal parts, sulphur and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a>, in fine powder, would be sufficient for a young beast; but to be of any permanent use, it must be continued at least a month; or salt might be of use. Rowelling also might be an efficacious preventative. Keep two rowels or fetons open in each beast during several months.\"\n\nIn the 5th vol. of the Farmers Magazine, is the following communication from a practical farmer re... specfing the cure of this complaint.\n\n\"The first cure for this complaint that I ever saw performed, was on an ox of four and a half years of age. As he was going in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>, I observed him a little lame in one of the hinder feet. At first I thought he had trampled upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>; but as it still grew worse, I soon suspected it was the quarter-ill; the more so, as there was a good year-old died of that disorder three weeks before. By the time he was got to the byre, the crackling between the skin and the flesh was very perceptible on the top joint of the off-side hinder leg. As our blacksmith had some skill among live stock, he was instantly sent for. The first thing he did was to take a little blood from a vein in the neck. He then pulled the skin from the flesh on the side that seemed most pained, still keeping the beast walking as much as possible. He then cauled cold water to be poured in large quantities on the part affected, still rubbing and keeping the skin loose on the affected part. Finding the skin to adhere much to the flesh, he then made three cuts with a penknife, two inches long, into which he rubbed salt and water. In this manner he continued four hours; the one time driving him, then pouring on water, rubbing in salt, and loosening the skin from the flesh. By this time he was not near to cripple, and began to take his food. We were ordered, however, to keep him in motion all night, and in the morning he was well for his food, and never had any more signs of the disease. Since that time I have followed the blacksmith's practice, and have often been successful. Only instead of pouring water on the place, I fasten a rope...\nrope about the beast's head, and take it to a deep pool, causing it to swim up and down, and drive it frequently, giving it an ounce or half an ounce of laudanum, according to the size or age of the beast, but I never did cut the skin. I have good reason to believe that the above method has been the means of curing several of my young cattle, as I never saw any that took that disease, and no means used for their recovery, but died; those I opened, had all the blood collected in the affected quarter. I find it more difficult to cure in the fore quarters than in the hinder, and if it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> the bowels, I hardly think that it will cure by any means.\"\n\n3. On the Rot in Sheep. General or True Rot. Hydropic Rot.\n\nThe name of the rot in sheep, and the ravages that are annually made by it among the flocks of most sheep districts, are familiar to every one; but little pains have been taken to fix the precise meaning of the word, and the particular disease, to denote which it should be exclusively employed. Some of those who appear to have paid particular attention to the subject, have yet followed the example of shepherds and farmers, in confounding under the name of rot, several diseases which differ considerably in their nature, causes, and method of treatment. Two medical men who have lately published; the one, Dr Dickson, on the General Management of Sheep, as connected with practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>; the other, Dr Harrison, on this particular subject of the rot, have still considered it as one disease. In the second appendix to Mr Findlater's Survey of Peebles, and in the fourth number of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Medical and Surgical Journal, the distinction of the rot into three different morbid affections, is, however, clearly marked; and there seems no doubt that these three diseases are very similar to consumption, hepatitis or inflammation of the liver, and fever, in the human body. The first of those which we have briefly noticed in No. 490, under the name of pulmonic rot, is distinguished by cough, hectic fever, wasting of flesh, and in many cases by the formation of a watery swelling below the chin. The second, mentioned by the name of hepatic rot in No. 493, is characterized by a degree of fever accompanied by inflammation, and thickening of the outer coat of the liver, or some diseased state of the biliary ducts or pipes, connected with the presence of flukes in the liver, if not sometimes produced by them. The third species has been called general rot, as in this the whole system is more or less affected; true rot, because it appears to be the most common of the three, and to be that to which the name seems more peculiarly applicable; and hydropic rot; because, if the animal is suffered to live, the disease commonly terminates in partial or general dropy. This species is what we are now to consider; and after having given as clear an account of it as we can collect from the descriptions that have been lately published, we shall make a few observations on the causes, treatment, and prevention of the rot in general, endeavouring as much as possible to discriminate between the three varieties.\n\nIt is probable that the first symptoms of the rot have seldom been observed. The earliest marks of the disease of which writers give an account, are, falling off in flesh, and an unusual dullness and heaviness. The flesh feels loose and flabby, especially about the loins; and if pressure is made about the hips, a crackling is sometimes perceptible. It is said that those who are accustomed to handle the ears and legs of sheep, may in the earliest stage of rot discover symptoms of low fever, but probably this is the case only in pulmonic and hepatic rot. Now, or soon afterwards, the countenance looks <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a>, as do the gums and tongue. On parting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEECE\">fleece</a>, the skin is found to have lost its fine rosy colour, and is become of a pale red. As the disease advances, the skin appears dappled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> and black spots. The eyes have a peculiar appearance; they lose their lustre, and look like the eyes of dead fish. Mr Findlater says, that in Tweeddale, the principal mark of rottenness is taken from the appearance of the eye in the corner next the nose, when the eyeball is turned so as to look away from the nose; as the flesh that adheres to the eyeball below the eyelids, in the corner next the nose, is in a foul sheep of a florid red colour; whereas in a rotten sheep, the flesh is of a dull appearance, and of a yellowish red colour, resembling that of a rotten egg, when the white and the yolk are confounded together. When the disease has continued long, the breath becomes fetid, the gums spongy, the teeth and sometimes the horns loose, the animal is commonly affected with a scouring, the fleece looks torn and ragged, and the wool separates from the skin with a slight pull. Great weakness and emaciation attend the latter stage of the disease; and these continually increase till the animal dies, or till dropy comes on, which always terminates fatally.\n\nThe principal appearance on dissection is presented by the liver, which is found in various states, according to the progress or severity of the disease. When a sheep is killed a few days after contracting the rot, the thin edge of the small lobe of the liver appears of a transparent white or bluish colour, and this colour spreads to a greater extent according to the severity of the complaint. Sometimes it does not extend more than an inch from the edge; at others it occupies a considerable part of the lobe. In severe cases, the whole external coat of the liver is found diseased, commonly assuming an opaque colour intermixed with lines or patches of a darker red. The upper part of the liver is sometimes found speckled like the back of a toad, to which it is said to bear a striking resemblance. Very commonly the liver is found full of hard knots, and sometimes there are ulcers in various parts of it. Are not some of these appearances peculiar to the hepatic rot? When the liver of a sheep affected with the rot is boiled, it loses its consistence, and breaks down into small pieces; whereas it is well known that a sound liver becomes by the same process firm and solid.\n\nWhen sheep have died suddenly in the first stage of this disorder, there may commonly be discovered a quantity of whey-like coloured fluid in the cavity of the belly; and in these cases the outside of the liver is generally covered with a coat of coagulable lymph. This is one of the appearances described by Dr Harrison; and is similar to what is often observed in the belly of animals that have died of dropy in the belly.\n\nIn stating the causes and treatment of general rot, we cannot perhaps do better than copy what is given on this subject in Mr Findlater's survey of Peebles, to which\nwhich we have already been so much obliged. \"It arises from deficient or bad aliment, whether the food itself be bad and scanty, or the animal be incapable of digesting it properly. It is most common from the former cause, want of food; and the disease is much the same with scurvy among the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>. In addition to these causes, whatever tends to depress the spirits, frequently excites, or at least exacerbates, the malady. It is said that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> in a garrison have been known to be seized with the scurvy on hearing bad news; and I doubt not but terrifying sheep with dogs, or other means, may produce or aggravate this disease. We may hence see what mischief a fox <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a>, or any exhibition of that sort, is calculated to bring upon a flock of sheep. The disease is also said to be produced by feeding upon watered grass; and hence shepherds, in many parts of Scotland, are careful to keep off their sheep from the tender grass produced by the occasional overflowing of rivulets. Feeding also in marshy and damp pastures, is known to be a powerful cause of the rot.\n\n\"The only means of cure are, a supply of good and wholesome food, and invigorating the stomach by permitting the animal to feed on those stimulating and aromatic herbs which are agreeable to its taste. It is believed that on dry sweet pastures, where there is a sufficient quantity of furze and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROOM\">broom</a>, juniper, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a> that are palatable to sheep, the rot is seldom heard of. When ground is down for sheep pasture, parsley, thyme, peppermint, and other aromatic herbs, should be sown with the grass seeds, as these plants serve both to prevent and to cure the rot. In addition to these means of cure, every thing that tends to annoy or depress the animal in its weakly state ought to be avoided.\"\n\nThe following facts with respect to the production of rot, considered as a general disease, are chiefly taken from Dr Harrifon's Inquiry.\n\nPoor, clayey, and loamy lands are most subject to rot.\n\nGrounds that are always dry, or always under water, and such as are always sufficiently wet to preserve a constant running of water, were never known to suffer from the rot.\n\nPonds of living water are equally safe; but when attempts to drain lands have been made, and have not fully succeeded, sheep which feed on such lands are very much exposed to the rot.\n\nGrounds newly laid down for pasture, or ploughed fields that have been exhausted by repeated crops, where the sward is thin, and where the water remains in patches for want of proper outlets, are peculiarly subject to the rot.\n\nMarshes that are overflowed by the sea, and boggy situations, especially in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, are seldom known to rot.\n\nLands that have been limed, and many soils that are chiefly composed of calcareous matter, are considered as very likely to produce the rot.\n\nEwes that are with lamb, or are giving suck, are less liable than other sheep to be affected with the rot.\n\nEight causes have been assigned for the production of rot, viz.\n\n1. A vitiated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a>. It is stated in the survey of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLNSHIRE\">Lincolnshire</a>, that a shepherd, who when young, was shepherd's boy to an old man that lived at Nettlam near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a>, a place famous for the rot, declared his persuasion that sheep took the rot, only in a morning before the dew was well off. His master's shepherd always kept his flock in fold till the dew was gone, and with only this attention his sheep were kept sound when all his neighbours lost their flocks. Dr Harrifon remarks, that if this cause were just, the rot should appear equally on all lands.\n\n2. The disease has been attributed to a gruit or earthy sediment that adheres to the grass after wet weather, or after the overflowing of running water.\n\n3. It has been supposed to be owing to the luxuriant and quick growing herbage that is produced in hot moist leasons. But all luxuriant pastures do not produce the rot.\n\n4. It has been attributed to the sheep grazing on some particular herbs, such as the butterwort (pinguicula vulgaris), the white rot (hydrocotyle vulgaris), round-leaved sundew (drosera rotundifolia), and long-leaved sundew (drosera longifolia); but these plants do not grow on every rotting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>.\n\n5. The disorder has been imputed to flukes in the liver. We have already stated our opinion, that flukes may produce the hepatic rot.\n\n6. The rot has been supposed to depend on the infection of sheep-pox. This opinion seems to have arisen from a confusion of terms.\n\n7. M. Daubenton considered the disease to be produced by poverty of food, and too much water. There is no doubt that these causes commonly produce the last species of rot which we have mentioned.\n\n8. Dr Harrifon is of opinion that the rot is always generated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXHALATION\">exhalation</a> or effluvia produced by the action of the sun's rays on soils that are partially covered by stagnant water. After adducing a number of ingenious arguments in support of his opinion, Dr Harrifon sums up the amount of his doctrine in the following manner.\n\n\"From the various circumstances enumerated, I think I am justified in attributing the rot in sheep and other animals to paludal effluvia; but with respect to their nature and constitution, it is very difficult to form any rational judgment, as they have hitherto eluded the most subtle and delicate inquiries. It must, however, be admitted, si causa latet, vis est notissima; and consequently the subject, from its great importance to the public in general, is entitled to a serious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>.\n\n\"Without heat and moisture, no deleterious vapours can be generated; and yet it is equally certain, that both these causes are insufficient to produce either a recurrent fever, or the rot, since they are confined to particular situations. Other auxiliaries are therefore necessary; and I am inclined to believe that vegetable or earthy particles, and probably both, are required, as well as heat and moisture, to constitute the noxious emanations or gases called miasmata paludum.\n\n\"Probably it will be found, on further inquiry, that a great variety of animal and vegetable effluvia are extracted in different places; and that many disorders should be attributed to them, which are at this time imputed to other causes.\n\n\"Poisonous vapours are extremely active and sudden in their effects, of which proofs may be found in the history...\"\nIndex.\n\nDiseases, history of every contagious and endemic disorder. We have, therefore, no reason to be surprised, that sheep and animals are so immediately affected by pasturing in moist places, where these effluvia are copiously produced in hot weather. Other causes operate slowly, and require such a long-continued application, that I do not think the rot can be induced by them, though I am of opinion, that by occasioning general weakness, they make the constitution more susceptible, and lay it more open to morbid impressions. In the human body, we know that fatigue, cold, fasting, and other debilitating causes, are efficacious auxiliaries, although of themselves they are totally inadequate to produce any contagious disorder. They, therefore, seem to contribute equally, and in the same manner, to facilitate the operations of many maladies, upon the human body and other animals.*\n\nIt is said, that for a short time after contracting the rot, sheep feed more heartily than usual; and for this reason, butchers and graziers, when they wish to fatten sheep speedily for the market, not unfrequently turn them into a rotting pasture.\n\nThe prevention of the rot will be easily suggested by attending to the facts and observations that have just been given, as it consists in avoiding the causes that seem to produce it, and avoiding or correcting the soil where it is found most readily to take place. \"It is confidently supposed, that decoctions of bitter herbs, with salt, have frequently preserved sheep from the rot. Salt is supposed to constitute a part of Fleet's celebrated nostrum; and we know that bitters are deservedly recommended to prevent intermittents, the dysentery and other disorders, which originate from exhalations.\n\n\"In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORDSHIRE\">Oxfordshire</a>, Dr. Lower has frequently known six or seven spoonfuls of strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRINE\">brine</a>, and stale urine, with foot steeped in it, to be given with great success. This is done at spring and fall of the year, when the dew is counted the most dangerous. This course of physic is continued eight or ten days, or till the sheep eat their meat heartily; and if they were taken in time, there seldom died any in a whole flock. For the same purpose, Ellis recommends the following medicine in his practical husbandry.\n\n\"Take a peck or better of malt, and mash it as though you would brew it into ale or beer, and make eleven or twelve gallons of liquor; then boil in it a quantity of shepherds purse, comfrey, sage, plantain, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENNY\">penny</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WORMWOOD\">wormwood</a>, and bloodwort; add <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YEAST\">yeast</a>, and afterwards salt, to the mixture; then turn the liquor into a vessel. After April comes in, give seven or eight spoonfuls to every sheep, once in the week, if the weather be wet; and if dry, not so often.*\"\n\nERRATA.\u2014N\u00b0 84.

Suppose the solid to be a spheroid produced by the revolution of an ellipse about either of its axes; put \\(a\\) for \\(\\frac{1}{2}AB\\) the axis round which the curve revolves, \\(b\\) for \\(\\frac{1}{2}EF\\) the other axis, \\(x\\) for AD the height of any segment made by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> perpendicular to the axis of the solid, \\(y\\) for PD the radius of its base, and \\(s\\) for its content. Then, from the nature of the curve \\(y^2 = \\frac{b^2}{a^2} (2ax-x^2)\\), therefore, taking the fluent upon the supposition that \\(s\\) and \\(x\\) vanish together,\n\n\\[ s = \\pi \\int y^2 \\dot{x} = \\frac{\\pi b^3}{a^3} \\int (2ax-x^2) \\dot{x} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{\\pi b^3}{a^3} \\left( ax^2 - \\frac{x^3}{3} \\right). \\]\n\nTo find the content of the whole spheroid we have only to take \\(x=2a\\), thus the formula becomes \\(s=\\frac{4\\pi b^2 a}{3}\\), and as \\(2\\pi b^2 a\\) expresses the content of a cylinder having \\(2b\\) for the diameter of its base, and \\(2a\\) for its height, it follows that the content of a spheroid is \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) that of its circumscribing cylinder.\n\nIt is obvious that what has been found for the spheroid will apply also to the sphere, by supposing the axes equal, or \\(a=b\\).\n\n164. If instead of supposing the solid \\(APQ\\) to be formed by the revolution of a curve round its axis (in which case it is called a solid of revolution) we had supposed it to have any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> whatever, then by referring the solid to some straight line AC, given by position, as an axis, and in which A is a given point, and supposing PQ to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of the solid made by a plane perpendicular to that axis, meeting it in D, and putting \\(AD=x\\), and the variable solid \\(APQ\\) (considered as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of \\(x\\)) \\(=s\\), by proceeding as in \u00a7 64, we would have found the limit of \\(\\frac{\\text{increment of } s}{\\text{increment of } x}\\), and consequently \\(\\frac{s}{x}\\), equal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of the section of the solid made by the plane \\(PQ\\); therefore, putting \\(V\\) for that function of \\(x\\) which expresses the area of the section, we have \\(s=Vx\\), and \\(s=\\int Vx\\).\n\nLet us suppose for example that \\(AEFG\\) is a solid Fig. 34 bounded by any plane figure \\(EFG\\) as a base, and by the surface which will be generated if we suppose a straight line drawn from A any given point above that plane to revolve in the circumference of the base.\n\nLet AC be a perpendicular drawn from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a> of the figure to its base, and let PQ be a section of the solid by a plane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the base, meeting the perpendicular in D. Put \\(a=\\) the area of the base of the solid, \\(V=\\) the area of the section \\(PQ\\), \\(b=\\) AC the altitude of the whole solid, \\(x=\\) AD the altitude of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> cut off by the plane \\(PQ\\), and \\(s=\\) the content of that part; then, as from the nature of the solid it is pretty evident that the part of it cut off by the plane \\(PQ\\) is similar to the whole, and as the bases of similar solids are as the squares of their altitudes, we have\n\n\\[ a : V :: b^2 : x^2, \\] hence \\(V=\\frac{ax^2}{b^2}\\), and\n\n\\[ s=\\int Vx=\\frac{a}{b^2} \\int x^2 \\dot{x} = \\frac{a x^3}{3 b^2}, \\]\n\nthis expression for \\(s\\) does not require the addition of any constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, for by putting \\(x=0\\), we have \\(s=0\\) as it ought to be. Suppose now \\(x=b\\), then \\(s=\\frac{ab^3}{3b^2}=\\frac{1}{3}ab\\), from which it appears that the content of the whole solid is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the product of the base by the perpendicular. It is evident that pyramids and cones are solids of the kind we have been considering.\n\nTo find the Surfaces of Solids.\n\n165. The altitude AD of a solid, generated by revolution of a curve about AD as an axis, being as before denoted by \\(x\\), and PD the radius of its base by \\(y\\), let us now put \\(s\\) to denote the curved surface of the solid, then, as it has been shewn, \u00a7 65, that \\(s=2\\pi y\\sqrt{(x^2+y^2)}\\), we have\n\n\\[ s=2\\pi \\int y \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2)} \\]\n\nas a general formula for the surface of a solid.\n\nEx. 1. Suppose the solid to be a sphere, generated by the revolution of a circle about its diameter AB, put Fig. 35 the radius of the sphere \\(=a\\), then, AD being denoted by \\(x\\), and PD by \\(y\\), we have from the nature of the curve \\(y^2=2ax-x^2\\), therefore\n\n\\[ y=\\sqrt{(2ax-x^2)}, \\text{ and } \\dot{y}=\\frac{(a-x)\\dot{x}}{\\sqrt{(2ax-x^2)}}. \\]\nPart II.\n\n\\[ \\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 = \\dot{x}^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{(a-x)^2}{2a x - x^2}\\right) \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{a^2 \\dot{x}^2}{2a x - x^2} = \\frac{a^2 \\dot{x}^2}{y^2}, \\]\n\ntherefore, \\( y \\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2} = a \\dot{x} \\), and taking the fluent, so that when \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( s = 0 \\),\n\n\\[ s = 2 \\pi \\int y \\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2} = 2 \\pi a x; \\]\n\nnow if it be considered that \\( 2 \\pi a \\) is the circumference of a great circle of the sphere, it will immediately appear that the surface of a segment of a sphere is equal to the circumference of a great circle of the sphere multiplied into the height of the segment. Hence it follows that the whole surface of the sphere is equal to four times the area of one of its great circles.\n\nEx. 2. Suppose the curve to be a parabola, then putting \\( AD = x \\), \\( DP = y \\), the parameter of the axis \\( a \\), we have (\\$ 161, example 1.)\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2} = \\frac{1}{a} \\dot{y} \\sqrt{a^2 + 4y^2}, \\text{ therefore} \\]\n\n\\[ s = 2 \\pi \\int y \\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{2 \\pi}{a} \\int y \\dot{y} \\sqrt{a^2 + 4y^2} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{\\pi}{6a} (a^2 + 4y^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} + C, \\text{ by } \\$ 108. \\]\n\nTo discover the value of the constant quantity \\( C \\), we must observe that when \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( y = 0 \\), and \\( s = 0 \\), therefore, putting 0 instead of \\( s \\) and \\( y \\), the above equation becomes \\( 0 = \\frac{\\pi}{6a} + C \\), hence \\( C = -\\frac{\\pi}{6a} \\), and\n\n\\[ s = \\pi \\left\\{ \\frac{(a^2 + 4y^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{6a} \\right\\}. \\]\n\nTo find the Centre of Gravity of any Line, Surface, or Solid.\n\n166.

Let us now suppose that \\( AP \\) is any curve line having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, of which the centre of gravity is required, and that \\( PB, PD \\) are co-ordinates drawn from any point in the curve perpendicular to \\( AB, AD \\) two axes at right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> to each other; let the arch \\( AP \\) receive any increment \\( Pp \\), let \\( C \\) be the centre of gravity of \\( AP \\), \\( G \\) the centre of gravity of \\( Pp \\), and \\( C' \\) the centre of gravity of \\( APp \\). From \\( C \\) and \\( G \\) draw \\( CE, CF, GH, GK \\) perpendicular to the axes \\( AB, AD \\). Put \\( PD = x, PB = y, CF = X, CE = Y, AP = z \\), also let the arch \\( APp = z' \\), and let the distances of \\( C' \\) its centre of gravity from the axes \\( AD, AB \\) be denoted by \\( X', Y' \\) respectively; then, observing that the arch \\( Pp = z' - z \\), by the proposition in last \u00a7,\n\n\\[ X + (z' - z) \\times GK = z' X' \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{z' X'}{z' - z} = z X = GK; \\]\n\nIf we now suppose the arch \\( Pp \\) to be continually diminished, and observe that \\( z' X' - z X \\), and \\( z' - z \\) are the simultaneous increments of \\( z X \\) and \\( z \\), it will appear (\\$ 23.) that\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a>. of } (z X)}{z} = \\text{limit of } GK. \\]\n\nBy the very same way of reasoning we find\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{flux. of } (z Y)}{z} = \\text{limit of } GH, \\]\n\nbut the point \\( p \\) approaching to \\( P \\), it is manifest that the point \\( G \\) will also approach to \\( P \\), so that the limit of \\( GK \\) is \\( PD \\) or \\( x \\), and the limit of \\( GH \\) is \\( PB \\) or \\( y \\), hence\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{flux. } (z X)}{z} = x, \\quad \\frac{\\text{flux. } (z Y)}{z} = y, \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{flux. } (z X) = x \\dot{z} \\text{ flux. } (z Y) = y \\dot{z}. \\]\n\nTaking now the fluents of each side of these equations, and dividing by \\( z \\),\n\n\\[ X = \\int \\frac{x \\dot{z}}{z}, \\quad Y = \\int \\frac{y \\dot{z}}{z}; \\]\n\nIt is evident that by these two equations the position of \\( C \\) the centre of gravity is determined.\n\n168. Let us next suppose that it is required to find \\( C \\) Fig. 37., the centre of gravity of the plane area \\( APB \\). As the arch \\( AP \\) was in last \u00a7 supposed to receive the increment \\( Pp \\), so let the area \\( APB \\) now receive the increment \\( BPp \\), and let \\( C, C' \\) and \\( G \\) (which in the former case were supposed to be the centres of gravity of the arches \\( AP, APp, \\) and \\( Pp \\) respectively) now be supposed to be the centres of gravity of the areas \\( APB, A_p b, \\) and \\( BPPp \\); put the area \\( APB = r \\), the area \\( A_p b = r' \\), and let \\( X, Y, X', Y' \\) denote as before.

Let it next be required to find the centre of gravity of the surface of a solid generated by the revolution of the curve AP about AB as an axis. Let the surface of the solid be conceived to receive an increment generated by Pp an arch of the curve. In this case it is evident that the centres of gravity of the surface generated by the curve AP, the surface generated by the curve APp, and the surface generated by the arch PP, will each be in AB, the axis of the solid; suppose them to be at E, E' and H respectively. Put AE = X, AE' = X', also put s for the surface generated by AP, and s' for the surface generated by APp, then as before (from \u00a7 166.) we have\n\n\\[ sX + (s'-s)AH = s'X', \\]\n\nhence\n\n\\[ \\frac{s'X' - sX}{s-s} = AH, \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ \\text{flux.}(sX) = \\lim.

If instead of the centre of gravity of the surface generated by AP, the centre of gravity of the solid generated by the revolution of the plane figure APB about AB as an axis be required, the reasoning will be the very same as in last \u00a7, substituting the solid generated by the plane figure instead of the surface generated by the curve line; so that putting s for the content of the solid, and X for AE the distance of its centre of gravity from the vertex, we have also\n\n\\[ X = \\int \\frac{x}{s}, \\]\n\nbut in this case \\( s = \\pi y^2 \\) (\\$ 64.), therefore\n\n\\[ X = \\frac{\\pi \\int y^2 x}{\\int y^2}. \\]\n\n171. We shall now apply these formulas to some examples.\n\nExample 1. Let it be required to find the centre of gravity of AP an arch of a circle. Suppose AB to be a part of the diameter, and in addition to the notation of \u00a7 167. put a for the radius of the circle, then from the nature of the curve, \\( y^2 = 2ax - x^2 \\), hence (proceeding as in \u00a7 165. Ex. 1.) we have \\( \\dot{x} = \\frac{a}{y} \\) and therefore \\( \\dot{y} = a \\dot{x} \\), and \\( \\ddot{x} = \\frac{a \\dot{x}}{y} \\), but from the equation \\( y^2 = 2ax - x^2 \\), by taking the fluxions we get \\( \\dot{y} = a \\dot{x} - x \\dot{x} \\), and hence \\( \\frac{\\dot{x}}{y} = \\frac{a \\dot{x}}{y} - \\dot{y} = \\dot{x} - \\dot{y} \\),\n\ntherefore \\( \\dot{x} = a(\\dot{x} - \\dot{y}) \\); substituting now the values of \\( \\dot{x} \\) and \\( \\dot{y} \\) in the formula of \u00a7 167 we have\n\n\\[ X = \\int \\frac{x \\dot{x}}{z} - \\frac{a}{z} \\int (\\dot{x} - \\dot{y}) \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{a}{z} (x - y + c) \\]\n\n\\[ Y = \\int \\frac{y \\dot{x}}{z} = \\frac{a}{z} \\int \\dot{x} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{a}{z} (x + c). \\]\n\nTo discover the values of the constant quantities c, c', we have from the equations in which they occur,\n\n\\[ ac = X - ax + ay, \\quad ac' = Y - ax; \\]\n\nbut when \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( x, y, X \\) and \\( Y \\) are each = 0, therefore \\( c = 0 \\), and \\( c' = 0 \\), thus we have simply\n\n\\[ X = \\frac{a(x-y)}{z}, \\quad Y = \\frac{ax}{z}. \\]\nEx. 2. Let it be required to find the centre of gravity of APB an area bounded by AP an arch of a circle and PB, BA its fine and verified fine. Let \\(a\\) denote the radius, and let the remaining notation be as in \u00a7168. Then, because \\(y = x^2\\), we have \\(x \\dot{s} = y \\dot{x}\\); but from the equation \\(y^3 = 2ax - x^3\\) (which expresses the nature of the curve), we find\n\n\\[x \\dot{s} = ax - y \\dot{y}, \\quad \\text{therefore}\\]\n\n\\[x \\dot{s} = ay \\dot{x} - y^2 \\dot{y} = ax - y^2 \\dot{y}.\\]\n\nWe have also \\(y \\dot{s} = y^2 \\dot{x} = (2ax - x^2) \\dot{x}\\), therefore,\n\n\\[X = \\frac{\\int x \\dot{s}}{\\dot{s}} = \\frac{\\int (ax - y^2 \\dot{y})}{\\dot{s}}\\]\n\n\\[= \\frac{1}{s}(ax - \\frac{1}{3}y^3 + c)\\]\n\n\\[Y = \\frac{\\int y \\dot{s}}{\\dot{s}} = \\frac{\\int (2ax - x^2) \\dot{x}}{\\dot{s}}\\]\n\n\\[= \\frac{1}{2s}(ax^2 - \\frac{1}{3}x^3 + c')\\]\n\nBy proceeding as in the last example we find \\(c\\) and \\(c'\\) each \\(= 0\\), thus we have\n\n\\[X = a - \\frac{y^3}{3s}, \\quad Y = \\frac{3}{2}ax^2 - \\frac{ax^3}{6s}.\\]\n\nEx. 3. Suppose now the figure to be the surface generated by the revolution of AP an arch of a circle about the diameter AB, and that the centre of gravity of the generated surface is required. Then because from the nature of the circle \\(x = \\frac{a \\dot{x}}{y}\\) we have \\(y \\dot{x} = ax\\), and \\(xy \\dot{s} = ax \\dot{x}\\), therefore, substituting these values in the formula of \u00a7169 it becomes\n\n\\[X = \\frac{\\int xy \\dot{s}}{\\int y \\dot{s}} = \\frac{\\int x \\dot{x}}{a \\dot{x}}\\]\n\n\\[= \\frac{1}{x+c'}.\\]\n\nTo find the values of the constant quantities \\(c\\), \\(c'\\), we have\n\n\\[c = X(x+c') - \\frac{1}{3}x^3,\\]\n\n\\[c' = \\frac{1}{3}x^3 + c - X.\\]\n\nbut as when \\(x = 0\\), then \\(X = 0\\), it is manifest that \\(c\\) and \\(c'\\) are each \\(= 0\\), thus we have\n\n\\[X = \\frac{1}{x}.\\]\n\nEx. 4. Let us now suppose that it is required to find the centre of gravity of the solid generated by the revolution of AP an arch of a circle about the diameter.

III. Of Fluxional Equations.\n\n172. It has been shewn, (\u00a749.) how, from an equation being given, expressing the relation between \\(x\\) a variable quantity, and \\(y\\) a function of that quantity, we may deduce the equation that expresses the relation of their fluxions. We are now to show how from the latter, or fluxional equation, we may return to the equation of the fluents, which, relatively to the other, may be called its primitive equation.\n\n173. As any primitive equation and the fluxional equation derived from it both hold true at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, and as the constant quantities which enter into the former retain the same values in the latter, it follows that by means of the two equations we may extinguish any one of the constant quantities, and thus from any proposed primitive equation deduce a fluxional equation, in which one of the constant quantities contained in that primitive shall not at all be found.\n\nFor example let the primitive equation be \\(y + ax + b = 0\\), by taking the fluxions we have \\(y + ax = 0\\), a fluxional equation in which \\(b\\) is not found; if however it be required to find an equation in which \\(a\\) shall be wanting, we have only to eliminate \\(a\\) by applying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> rules of algebra (Algebra, Sect. vii.) to the two equations\n\n\\[y + ax + b = 0, \\quad y + ax = 0,\\]\n\nand hence we have \\(y + ax + b = 0\\), thus it appears that from the primitive equation \\(y + ax + b = 0\\) we may deduce a fluxional equation which may be expressed under either of these forms\n\n\\[y + ax = 0, \\quad y + ax + b = 0;\\]\n\nthese hold true at the same time as the primitive equation, they are alike related to it, and any two of the three being given the other necessarily follows from them.\n\nAs a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> example, suppose the primitive equation to be \\(x^2 - 2ay - a^2 - b = 0\\), by passing to the fluxions we immediately find \\(x - a y = 0\\) an equation in which \\(b\\) is not found. If, however, it be required that the fluxional equation shall want \\(a\\), we have only to apply the common rules of elimination to the two equations; thus from the second we get \\(a = \\frac{x}{y}\\), and this being substituted in the first it becomes\nfrom which we have\n\n\\[(x^2 - b) \\dot{y}^2 - 2xy \\dot{y} \\dot{x} - x^2 \\dot{x}^2 = 0\\]\n\nand taking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> root, having previously reduced the equation to a proper form,\n\n\\[\\dot{y} \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 - b)} - y \\dot{y} - x \\dot{x} = 0.\\]\n\n174. It is evident that by proceeding in this manner we shall, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, arrive at a fluxional equation involving the second and higher powers of \\(\\frac{y}{x}\\), and when this happens we can only find the value of \\(\\frac{y}{x}\\) by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of an equation; but this may be avoided by preparing the primitive equation in such a manner, that the constant quantity to be eliminated may be entirely separated from the variable quantities, so as to form one of the terms of the equation, then, upon taking the fluxions, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> being constant will vanish, and thus we shall obtain an equation entirely free from the constant quantity contained in that term. Thus the primitive equation \\(y + ax + bx = 0\\) has already such a form that by taking the fluxions we get \\(y + ax = 0\\) an equation in which \\(b\\) is not found. If it be required, that upon taking the fluxions, \\(a\\) shall vanish; we must put the equation under this form \\(\\frac{y + b}{x} + a = 0\\), and then taking the fluxion, we find immediately\n\n\\[x \\dot{y} - (y + b) \\dot{x} = 0,\\]\n\nan expression in which \\(a\\) is not found, and which by rejecting the divisor \\(x\\) becomes \\(y \\dot{x} - x \\dot{y} + b \\dot{x} = 0\\), and these two forms of the fluxional equation are the very same as have been found in the last \u00a7. In the second example, viz. \\(x^2 - 2ay + b^2 = 0\\), the equation has already the form suited to the elimination of \\(b\\), for the fluxional equation is \\(x \\dot{x} - ay = 0\\), but in order that \\(a\\) may vanish, we must resolve the equation with respect to \\(a\\), so as to give it this form\n\n\\[y = \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 - b)} + a = 0;\\]\n\npassing now to the fluxional equation, \\(a\\) disappears, and we have\n\n\\[\\dot{y} \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 - b)} - y \\dot{y} - x \\dot{x} = 0\\]\n\nIt is evident that we have only to reject the denominator to give the equation this form\n\n\\[\\dot{y} \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 - b)} - y \\dot{y} - x \\dot{x} = 0\\]\n\nthe same as was found in the conclusion of last \u00a7.\n\n175. From what has been now shewn we may infer that as from any proposed primitive equation we can deduce a fluxional equation that shall contain one constant quantity less than the primitive contains, so on the contrary any fluxional equation being given, its primitive equation may contain one constant quantity more than the fluxional equation, but it can contain only one, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more than one constant quantity can be made to disappear by returning from the primitive to its fluxional equation.\n\n176. The fluxional equation expressing the value of \\(\\frac{y}{x}\\), which is derived from any primitive equation involving \\(x\\), and \\(y\\) a function of \\(x\\), may be called a fluxional equation of the first order; and as from this equation considered as a primitive, we may, in like manner derive an equation that shall involve \\(\\frac{y}{x}\\) (\\$ 50.), this last may be called a fluxional equation of the second order, and the fluxional equation from which it is derived may be called its primitive equation of the first order, to distinguish it from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> primitive equation, from which all the others are conceived to be derived. A similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> is to be applied to the higher orders.\n\n177. As any primitive equation and the fluxional equations of the first and second orders derived from it must all hold true at the same time, it is evident, that by means of the three equations, we may exterminate any two of the constant quantities contained in them that we please, and thus produce a fluxional equation of the second order that contains two constant quantities less than the primitive equation. There are however two other ways by which we may arrive at the very same fluxional equation of the second order. For as from the given primitive equation we may deduce two different fluxional equations of the first order, one of which shall contain one only of the two quantities to be eliminated, and the other shall contain the other quantity only, we may consider each of these equations in its turn as a primitive, and, by proceeding in the manner explained in \u00a7 173 and \u00a7 174, derive from it a fluxional equation, in which that particular constant quantity which remained in its primitive, but which was to be finally eliminated, shall not be found; thus, from each of these primitives we shall deduce the very same fluxional equation of the second order, that shall be freed from two of the constant quantities contained in the absolute primitive equation.\n\nLet us take for example the equation\n\n\\[x^2 - 2ay + b^2 = 0;\\]\n\nby proceeding as explained in \u00a7 173, or \u00a7 174, we find these two fluxional equations of the first order,\n\n\\[x \\dot{x} - ay = 0, \\quad (x^2 + b^2) \\dot{y} - 2xy \\dot{x} = 0,\\]\n\nin the one of these, the constant quantity \\(a\\) is wanting, and in the other \\(b\\) is wanting. Taking the first equation \\(x \\dot{x} - ay = 0\\), and proceeding as in \u00a7 50 (observing that \\(x\\) is constant) we find \\(x \\dot{x} - ay = 0\\), if from this equation we now eliminate \\(a\\) by putting instead of it \\(\\frac{x \\dot{x}}{y}\\)\n\n(deduced from the equation \\(x \\dot{x} - ay = 0\\)) we find after proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a>\nNow the fluent of \\( \\frac{m \\dot{x}}{x} \\) is \\( m.l.x + c' \\) (\\$103.) and in like manner the fluent of \\( \\frac{n \\dot{y}}{y} \\) is \\( n.l.y + c'' \\); therefore\n\n\\[ m.l.x + n.l.y + c' + c'' = 0, \\]\n\nor, transposing \\( c' + c'' \\), and putting a single constant quantity for their sum, which, to be homogeneous with the logarithmic quantities may be \\(-\\log_e c\\) or \\(-l.c\\),\n\n\\[ m.l.x + n.l.y = l.c, \\text{ or } l.(x^m) + l.(y^n) = l.c, \\]\n\nor \\( l.(x^m y^n) = l.c \\), and hence \\( x^m y^n = c \\),\n\nwhich last is the primitive equation required.\n\n180. When a primitive equation is homogeneous, that is when the sum of the exponents of the variable quantities \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is the same in each term, as in this example,\n\n\\[ ax + by + dx + ey + fy = 0 \\]\n\nor \\((ax + by)(x + (dx + ey))y = 0 \\)\n\nin which the variable part of each term is of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, as also in this equation\n\n\\[ (ax + bx + dy + dy^2)x + (ex + fx + gy + gy^2)y = 0 \\]\n\nin which the variable part of each term is of the second degree, such an equation may be always transformed into another which will admit of the variable quantities being separated. To take a particular example, let us suppose the equation to be \\( x + y = nyx \\), or \\((x - ny)x + y = 0 \\). We assume \\( y = nx \\) (and the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> is to be made for any other homogeneous equation,) then \\( y = nx + nx \\), thus the equation becomes transformed to\n\n\\[ (x - nx)x + nx(nx + nx) = 0, \\]\n\nbut as the terms of this equation have a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTOR\">factor</a> \\( x \\), by leaving out that factor, it becomes\n\n\\[ (1 - nx)x + nx(nx + nx) = 0, \\]\n\nwhich also admits of being expressed thus\n\n\\[ (1 - nx + nx^2)x + nx^2 = 0, \\]\n\nand, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>\n\n\\[ \\frac{x}{x} + \\frac{nx}{1 - nx + nx^2} = 0, \\]\n\nand taking the fluents\n\n\\[ \\int \\frac{\\dot{x}}{x} + \\int \\frac{\\dot{x}}{1 - nx + nx^2} = C, \\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) denotes a constant quantity, or, since \\( \\int \\frac{\\dot{x}}{x} = l.x \\),\n\n\\[ l.x + \\int \\frac{\\dot{x}}{1 - nx + nx^2} = C, \\]\n\nnow\nnow the particular form of \\( \\int \\frac{z^2}{1 - n z + z^2} \\) depends upon the value of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> \\( n \\); for if \\( \\frac{n}{2} > 1 \\), it will be a logarithmic function, and if \\( \\frac{n}{2} < 1 \\), it will be expressible by means of a circle, but if \\( \\frac{n}{2} = 1 \\), then it is an algebraic function, and in each case it may be found by the methods delivered in Sect. I. for finding the fluent of a rational fraction. It may however, be simplified in its form, by observing, that since\n\n\\[\n\\frac{z^2}{1 - n z + z^2} = \\frac{2 z - n z}{1 - n z + z^2} + \\frac{n z}{1 - n z + z^2},\n\\]\n\ntherefore (\u00a7 103.) \\( \\int \\frac{z^2}{1 - n z + z^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int \\frac{2 z}{1 - n z + z^2} + \\frac{n z}{1 - n z + z^2}. \\)\n\nIf we limit our enquiry to the case of \\( n = 2 \\), we have\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{z^2}{1 - 2 z + z^2} = \\frac{2}{1 - z},\n\\]\n\nlet the terms be now collected into one expression, then observing that \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (1 - 2 z + z^2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (1 - z)^2 = 1 \\cdot (1 - z) \\), we have\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot (1 - z) + \\frac{1}{1 - z} = C;\n\\]\n\nand, substituting \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\) instead of \\( z \\),\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{x - y}{x} \\right) + \\frac{x}{x - y} = C,\n\\]\n\nor, substituting \\( 1 \\cdot c \\) instead of \\( C \\), and collecting the logarithmic functions into one,\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot \\frac{x - y}{c} = \\frac{-x}{x - y}\n\\]\n\ntherefore, passing from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">logarithms</a> to numbers, by observing that, as when \\( a = 1 \\cdot p \\), we have by the nature of logarithms \\( e^a = p \\), where \\( e \\) denotes the number of which the Napierian logarithm is 1, so in the present case we have \\( \\frac{x - y}{c} = e^{-x/y} \\), and hence the primitive equation is found to be\n\n\\[\nx - y - c e^{-x/y} = 0.\n\\]\n\nAs a second example let the fluxional equation be\n\n\\[\nxy - y = x \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}\n\\]\n\nwhich is also homogeneous. Assume as before \\( y = x z \\), then \\( y = x z + x z \\), and substituting these values of \\( y \\) and \\( y \\) in the proposed equation, it becomes\n\n\\[\nx \\sqrt{(1 + z^2)} - x z = 0,\n\\]\n\nfrom which we get\n\n\\[\n\\frac{z}{x} \\sqrt{(1 + z^2)} = 0,\n\\]\n\nand taking the fluents of the terms, observing that each being a logarithm function, their sum may be put equal to a constant logarithm,\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{y + \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}}{x} \\right) = 1 \\cdot c,\n\\]\n\nwhich expression, by substituting for \\( z \\) its value \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\), becomes\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot c + 1 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{y + \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}}{x} \\right).\n\\]\n\nIf we now consider that\n\n\\[\n(y + \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2})(y - \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}) = -x^2,\n\\]\n\nand therefore that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y + \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}}{x} = \\frac{-x}{y - \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}},\n\\]\n\nit will appear, that the above equation may be otherwise expressed thus:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{-x}{y - \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}} \\right),\n\\]\n\nfrom which, by passing from logarithms to their numbers, we find \\( y - \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)} = -c \\), and hence, by so ordering the equation that the radical may disappear, we get \\( x^2 = c^2 + 2 c y \\), which is the primitive equation required.\n\n181. An equation which is not homogeneous, may in some cases, by proper transformations, be rendered homogeneous; this is the case in particular with the equation\n\n\\[\n(a + m x + n y) \\dot{x} + (b + p x + q y) \\dot{y} = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich is general of its kind; for this purpose we assume \\( x = t + u \\), and \\( y = u + \\beta \\), then \\( \\dot{x} = \\dot{t} \\), and \\( \\dot{y} = \\dot{u} \\); by substituting these values of \\( x, y, \\dot{x}, \\dot{y} \\), in the proposed equation it becomes\n\n\\[\n(a + m a + n \\beta + m t + n u) \\dot{t} + (b + p a + q \\beta + p t + q u) \\dot{u} = 0.\n\\]\n\nLet us now suppose \\( a \\) and \\( \\beta \\) such that\n\n\\[\na + m a + n \\beta = 0,\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb + p a + q \\beta = 0,\n\\]\n\nby these two equations the values of \\( a \\) and \\( \\beta \\) are determined, and the transformed equation is reduced to\n\n\\[\n(m t + n u) \\dot{t} + (p t + q u) \\dot{u} = 0,\n\\]\n\nan equation which is homogeneous, and therefore may be treated in the manner explained in last \u00a7.\n\nThis transformation will not apply however, when \\( m q - n p = 0 \\), because then the values of \\( a \\) and \\( \\beta \\) would be infinite.\nLet us take a particular case, and suppose the equation to be \\( y + y' = x^n \\), then we have \\( P = 1, Q = x^n \\), and \\( \\int P'x = x \\), hence in this case the general formula becomes\n\n\\[\ny = e^{-x} \\left\\{ \\int e^x x^n x' + c \\right\\}.\n\\]\n\nThe fluent \\( \\int e^x x^n x' \\) may be found by \u00a7 143; let us suppose for example that \\( n = 2 \\), then we have\n\n\\[\n\\int e^x x^2 x' = e^x (x^2 - 2x + 2),\n\\]\n\nso that the fluxional equation being\n\n\\[\ny' + y = x^2 x',\n\\]\n\nthe primitive equation is\n\n\\[\ny = x^2 - 2x + 2 + ce^{-x}.\n\\]\n\nThe general equation \\( y' + Py = Qx \\), which involves the simple power only of the variable quantity \\( y \\), and its fluxion, has been called a linear equation of the first order; it has also, with more propriety, been called a fluxional equation of the first degree, and of the first order.\n\n183. The equation\n\n\\[\ny' + Py = Qy^n x',\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) as before denote any functions of \\( x \\), is easily reduced to the form we have been considering; for assume \\( y^{1-n} = (1-n)x \\), then \\( y^{-n} y' = x \\), and \\( y = y^n \\); and \\( y = (1-n)y^n x' \\); if we now substitute the values of \\( y' \\) and \\( y \\) in the equation, it becomes\n\n\\[\ny^n x' + (1-n)P y^n x' = Q y^n x';\n\\]\n\nlet the terms of this equation be divided by \\( y^n \\), then, including the factor \\( (1-n) \\) in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">indeterminate</a> function \\( P \\), the result is\n\n\\[\nz + Px = Q x;\n\\]\n\nan equation of the very same form as that which has been considered in last \u00a7.\n\n184. The most general form that can be given to a fluxional equation of the first order, and consisting of three terms only, is\n\n\\[\ny u^i x^k x' + \\beta u^i x^b x' = \\alpha u^i x^f x';\n\\]\n\nto give this equation a more simple form let all its terms be divided by \\( y u^i x^f \\), it then becomes\n\n\\[\nx^i - f x' + \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} u^i x^b - f x' = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma} u^i - i x'.\n\\]\n\nSuppose now\n\n\\[\nx^i - f x' = \\frac{y}{k-f+1}, \\quad u^i x^b - f x' = \\frac{x}{g-i+1};\n\\]\n\nthen \\( x^i - f + 1 = y, \\quad u^i - i + 1 = x \\),\n\nand\nand \\( y + \\frac{(k-f+1)\\beta}{(g-i+1)\\gamma} y = \\frac{b-f}{g-i+1} x \\).\n\nLet us in order to abridge put\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(k-f+1)\\beta}{(g-i+1)\\gamma} = b, \\quad \\frac{(k-f+1)\\alpha}{(g-i+1)\\gamma} = a,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{h-f}{k-f+1} = n, \\quad \\frac{e-g}{g-i+1} = m,\n\\]\n\nthen the equation becomes\n\n\\[\ny + b y^n x = a x^m x.\n\\]\n\nIf we suppose \\( n = 1 \\), the resulting equation \\( y + b y x = a x^m x \\) may have its variable quantities separated by the method explained in \u00a7 183; but if we go only one step farther, and suppose \\( n = 2 \\) so that the equation is\n\n\\[\ny + b y^2 x = a x^m x,\n\\]\n\nthe difficulty of separating the variable quantities generally is so great as to have hitherto baffled the utmost efforts of the most expert analysts. This equation is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called Riccati's equation, on account of its having been first treated of by an Italian mathematician of that name, who succeeded in separating the variable quantities in some particular cases, namely, when \\( m \\) is equal to \\( \\frac{-4p}{2p-1} \\), where \\( p \\) denotes any whole positive number.\n\n185. If the separating of the variable quantities generally be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> of insurmountable difficulty when the equation consists of only three terms, its solution can much less be expected, when the equation consists of four, or any greater number. There are, however, particular cases in which some of the most skilful analysts have, by employing happy and peculiar artifices, succeeded in resolving the problem, but the methods of proceeding are, generally speaking, not reducible to any determinate rules.\n\n186. When the expression which constitutes a fluxional equation is such as would be produced by taking the fluxion of some function of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), in which case it may be said to be a complete fluxion, then, without attempting to separate the variable quantities, we have only to add a constant quantity to that function, and the result put \\( = 0 \\), will evidently be the primitive equation required.\n\nIf, for example, the equation be \\( xy + yx = 0 \\), it is obvious that the expression \\( xy + yx \\) is immediately produced by taking the fluxion of the function \\( xy \\) ( \\( y \\) being also considered as a function of \\( x \\)), therefore the primitive equation is \\( xy + c = 0 \\).\n\nFrom the view which has been given in \u00a7 174, of the origin of fluxional equations it appears, that in passing from a primitive equation to its fluxional equation, the terms of the latter in many cases will not constitute a complete fluxion, by reason of some multiplier, or divisor, which was common to them all, having disappeared. In such cases, however, if we can by any means discover that factor, by restoring it we shall immediately have a complete fluxion, the fluent of which, with the addition of a constant quantity, when put \\( = 0 \\), will be the primitive equation.\n\nFor example, if the equation be \\( xy - yx = 0 \\), here \\( xy - yx \\) cannot be immediately produced by taking the fluxion of a function of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\); but, if we divide the equation by \\( x^2 \\) so as to give it this form \\( \\frac{xy - yx}{x^2} = 0 \\), we obtain the expression \\( \\frac{xy - yx}{x^2} \\) which is a complete fluxion, viz. that of the fraction \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\), therefore \\( \\frac{y}{x} + c = 0 \\), or \\( y + cx = 0 \\), is the primitive equation.\n\nIn like manner, the equation \\( mx + ny = 0 \\), which does not in its present form express a complete fluxion, yet becomes so when multiplied by \\( x^{n-1} y^{m-1} \\), for then it is\n\n\\[\nmx^n y^{m-1} + nx^{n-1} y^m = 0\n\\]\n\nfrom which it appears that the primitive equation in this case must be \\( x^n y^m + c = 0 \\).\n\n187. That we may be able to discover whether the terms of any proposed fluxional equation constitute a complete fluxion, and also from what expression such a fluxion has been derived, we must attend to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, by which we find the fluxion of an expression composed of two variable quantities, one of which is a function of the other.\n\nTo avoid very general reasoning, we shall take for granted what is evidently possible, that any function of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) may be generally expressed by a formula of this nature.\n\n\\[\nAx^m y^n + Bx^p y^q + Cx^r y^s + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A, B, C, \\ldots \\) denote constant quantities, and the exponents \\( m, n, \\ldots \\) given numbers, the number of terms being supposed either finite or infinite. Now the fluxion of the whole expression is the sum of the fluxions of its terms, but in taking the fluxion of each term, beginning with the first \\( Ax^m y^n \\), the fluxion of which is\n\n\\[\nmAx^{m-1} y^n x + nAx^m y^{n-1} y,\n\\]\n\nit is evident that the result is composed of two parts, one of which is the expression we would find for its fluxion, if \\( x \\) only were considered as variable, and \\( y \\) as constant, and the other is the expression for its fluxion, if \\( y \\) only were considered as variable and \\( x \\) as constant; hence it follows, that the sum of the fluxions of all the terms will have the very same property; so that, if \\( u \\) be put for the whole expression, we shall in every case have\n\n\\[\nu = Mx + Ny\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( Mx \\) denotes the result that will be found if the fluxion of \\( u \\) be taken upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> that \\( x \\) alone, is\nPart II.\n\nF L U X I O N S.\n\nInverse Method.\n\nis variable, and \\( N \\dot{y} \\) is the fluxion of \\( u \\), supposing \\( y \\) alone to be variable.\n\n188. Refining the consideration of the general expression\n\n\\[\nA x^m y^n + B x^p y^q + C x^r y^s + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nlet the fluxion of every one of its terms, for example, \\( A x^m y^n \\), be taken, supposing \\( x \\) alone variable, and the result is \\( m A x^{m-1} y^n \\). Again, let the fluxion of this result be taken, supposing \\( y \\) alone variable, and we find it to be \\( m n A x^{m-1} y^{n-1} \\). Now, if we first take the fluxion of \\( A x^m y^n \\), supposing \\( y \\) variable, we get \\( n A x^m y^{n-1} \\); and then, the fluxion of this result, considering \\( x \\) alone as variable, we get \\( mn A x^{m-1} y^{n-1} \\), which is the very same expression as was found by proceeding in a contrary order; and as the same must hold true of all the terms, we may conclude, that if the fluxion of \\( u \\) any function of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) be taken, considering \\( x \\) only as variable, and then the fluxion of that result, considering \\( y \\) only as variable, the very same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> result will be obtained as if we were first to take the fluxion of \\( u \\) supposing \\( y \\) variable, and then the fluxion of that result, supposing \\( x \\) variable; but the fluxion of \\( u \\) being expressed thus, \\( M \\dot{x} + N \\dot{y} \\), it has been shown that \\( M \\dot{x} \\) is the fluxion of \\( u \\), if \\( x \\) only be supposed variable, and \\( N \\dot{y} \\) is its fluxion, if \\( y \\) only be variable, therefore, if we take the fluxion of \\( M \\dot{x} \\) upon the supposition that \\( y \\) only is variable, also the fluxion of \\( N \\dot{y} \\) upon the supposition that \\( x \\) only is variable, the results must be identical. This property affords the following rule, by which we may always determine whether any proposed expression constitutes an exact fluxion or not. Let the expression be put under this form \\( M \\dot{x} + N \\dot{y} \\); let \\( M' \\dot{y} \\) be the fluxion of \\( M \\), supposing \\( y \\) alone variable, and \\( N' \\dot{x} \\) the fluxion of \\( N \\) supposing \\( x \\) alone variable, then, if \\( M' \\) and \\( N' \\) are identical, \\( M \\dot{x} + N \\dot{y} \\) is a complete fluxion; and if they are not, \\( M \\dot{x} + N \\dot{y} \\) is not a complete fluxion.\n\n189. It is easy to see, how, from a complete fluxion \\( u = M \\dot{x} + N \\dot{y} \\) we may determine \\( u \\) its fluent; for as \\( M \\dot{x} \\) has been deduced from \\( u \\) by considering \\( x \\) as variable, and \\( y \\) as constant, on which account all the terms of \\( u \\) that involved \\( y \\) only must have vanished, it follows on the contrary, that if we put \\( Y \\) to denote those terms, we shall have\n\n\\[\nu = \\int M \\dot{x} + Y\n\\]\n\nthe fluent of \\( M \\dot{x} \\) being taken, regarding \\( x \\) only as variable. The function \\( Y \\) may be determined, by comparing the fluxion of the expression thus obtained with the given fluxion \\( M \\dot{x} + N \\dot{y} \\).\n\nEx. 1. Let the fluxion be\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a \\dot{y} + 2x \\dot{x} + y \\dot{x} + x \\dot{y}}{2 \\sqrt{(ay + x^2 + xy)}}\n\\]\n\nthis expression when reduced to the form \\( u = M \\dot{x} + N \\dot{y} \\) is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(2x + y) \\dot{x}}{2 \\sqrt{(ay + x^2 + xy)}} + \\frac{(a + x) \\dot{y}}{2 \\sqrt{(ay + x^2 + xy)}}\n\\]\n\nhence \\( M = \\frac{2x + y}{2 \\sqrt{(ay + x^2 + xy)}} \\), \\( N = \\frac{a + x}{2 \\sqrt{(ay + x^2 + xy)}} \\), the fluxion of \\( M \\), supposing \\( y \\) only variable, gives us\n\n\\[\nM' \\dot{y} = \\frac{(ay + xy - 2ax) \\dot{y}}{4(a y + x^2 + xy)^{\\frac{3}{2}}},\n\\]\n\nand in like manner the fluxion of \\( N \\), supposing \\( x \\) only variable, gives\n\n\\[\nN' \\dot{x} = \\frac{(ay + xy - 2ax) \\dot{x}}{4(a y + x^2 + xy)^{\\frac{3}{2}}},\n\\]\n\nhence it appears that \\( M' = N' \\), and therefore that the proposed expression is an exact fluxion. To determine its fluent, the formula \\( u = \\int M \\dot{x} + Y \\) gives us\n\n\\[\nu = \\sqrt{(ay + x^2 + xy)} + Y\n\\]\n\nthe fluxion of this expression taken, upon the supposition that both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are variable, is\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\frac{a \\dot{y} + 2x \\dot{x} + y \\dot{x} + x \\dot{y}}{2 \\sqrt{(ay + x^2 + xy)}} + \\dot{Y}\n\\]\n\nthis result, compared with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> fluxion, shews that \\( \\dot{Y} = 0 \\), and \\( Y = c \\), a constant quantity.\n\nEx. 2. Suppose the fluxion to be\n\n\\[\n\\dot{x} \\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)} + \\dot{y} \\frac{(a^2 + xy + 2y^2)}{\\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)}}\n\\]\n\nHere \\( M = \\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)} \\), \\( N = \\frac{a^2 + xy + 2y^2}{\\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)}} \\), and by proceeding, as in last example, we shall find \\( M' = N' = \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)}} \\), hence it follows that the expression is a complete fluxion, and the formula \\( u = \\int M \\dot{x} + Y \\) shews that\n\n\\[\nu = \\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)} + Y\n\\]\n\nTo determine \\( Y \\), we take the fluxion of this expression, supposing \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) both variable, and find it to be\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\dot{x} \\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)} + \\frac{xy \\dot{y}}{\\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)}} + \\dot{Y},\n\\]\n\nand this compared with the original fluxion\n\n\\[\n\\dot{u} = \\dot{x} \\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)} + \\frac{(a^2 + xy + 2y^2) \\dot{y}}{\\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)}},\n\\]\n\nshews that \\( \\dot{Y} = \\frac{(a^2 + 2y^2) \\dot{y}}{\\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)}} \\), hence\n\n\\[\nY = \\int \\frac{(a^2 + 2y^2) \\dot{y}}{\\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)}} = y \\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)}\n\\]\n\ntherefore the fluent required is\n\\[ u = x \\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)} + y \\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)} + C \\]\n\\[ = (x + y) \\sqrt{(a^2 + y^2)} + C, \\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) denotes a constant quantity.\n\n190. It may be demonstrated, that as often as a fluxional equation does not constitute a complete fluxion, there is always an infinite number of factors, such that if the equation were multiplied by any one of them, the result would be a complete fluxion. A general method of determining some one of these factors, however, seems to be a problem of such difficulty, that its solution, except in some particular cases, is not to be expected.\n\n191. When a fluxional equation involves the second or higher powers of \\( \\dot{x} \\) and \\( \\dot{y} \\), as in this example\n\n\\[ \\dot{y}^2 - a^2 \\dot{x}^2 = 0, \\]\n\nwhich may be put under this form,\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{y}^2}{\\dot{x}^2} - a^2 = 0, \\]\n\nwe may, by the theory of algebraic equations, deduce from it the values of \\( \\frac{\\dot{y}}{\\dot{x}} \\), considering this quantity as a root of the equation; thus, in the present example, by resolving the quadratic equation \\( \\frac{\\dot{y}^2}{\\dot{x}^2} - a^2 = 0 \\), we have\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{y}}{\\dot{x}} = \\pm a, \\]\n\nso that \\( \\dot{y} - a \\dot{x} = 0 \\) and \\( \\dot{y} + a \\dot{x} = 0 \\), hence\n\n\\[ y - ax + c = 0, \\quad y + ax + c' = 0, \\]\n\nare two primitive equations, from either of which the fluxional equation \\( \\dot{y}^2 - a^2 \\dot{x}^2 = 0 \\) may be derived, and it may also be deduced from their product\n\n\\[ (y - ax + c)(y + ax + c') = 0. \\]\n\n192. As often as the equation contains only one of the two variable quantities, for example \\( x \\), by the resolution of the equation we may obtain \\( \\frac{\\dot{y}}{\\dot{x}} = X \\) (where \\( X \\) denotes some function of \\( x \\)), and hence \\( y = \\int X \\dot{x} \\), but if it be more easy to resolve the equation with respect to \\( x \\) than to \\( \\frac{\\dot{y}}{\\dot{x}} \\) which we shall denote by \\( p \\), then, instead of seeking the values of \\( p \\) from the equation, we may find that of \\( x \\), thus we shall have \\( x = P \\), some function of \\( p \\), and hence \\( \\dot{x} = \\dot{P} \\), and since \\( \\dot{y} = p \\dot{x} \\); therefore, \\( y = p \\dot{P} \\), and \\( y = \\int p \\dot{P} = P \\int \\dot{P} \\). The relation between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is now to be found by eliminating \\( p \\) by means of the two equations\n\n\\[ x = P, \\quad y = P \\dot{P} = \\int \\dot{P}. \\]\n\nAs a particular example, let us suppose the equation to be \\( x \\dot{x} + ay = b \\sqrt{(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2)} \\), from which, by putting\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\dot{y}}{\\dot{x}} = p \\] we find\n\n\\[ x = b \\sqrt{(1 + p^2)} - ap = P, \\]\n\n\\[ y = b p \\sqrt{(1 + p^2)} - \\frac{1}{2} a p^3 - b \\int \\dot{p} \\sqrt{(1 + p^2)}. \\]\n\nThe fluent of \\( \\dot{p} \\sqrt{(1 + p^2)} \\) may be found by the formulas given in \u00a7 130 and \u00a7 131.\n\n193. When we cannot by any means find an expression for the relation between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in finite terms, then we must, as a last resource, have recourse to approximation, that is, we must express the value of \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\) by means of a series.\n\nWhen the form of the series is known, we may determine the coefficients of its terms, by substituting the series and its fluxion instead of \\( y \\) and \\( \\dot{y} \\) in the proposed equation.\n\nSuppose, for example, that the equation is\n\n\\[ \\dot{y} + y \\dot{x} - mx^n \\dot{x} = 0 \\]\n\nwe may assume\n\n\\[ y = Ax^n + Bx^{n+1} + Cx^{n+2} + \\&c. \\]\n\nthen \\( \\dot{y} = nAx^{n-1} + (n+1)Bx^n + (n+2)Cx^{n+1} + \\&c. \\)\n\nSubstituting now the values of \\( y \\) and \\( \\dot{y} \\) in the equation, and dividing the whole by \\( \\dot{x} \\), it becomes\n\n\\[ A \\left( \\frac{n}{n+1} \\right) x^n + \\left( \\frac{n+1}{n+2} \\right) Bx^n + \\left( \\frac{n+2}{n+3} \\right) Cx^{n+1} + \\&c. = 0. \\]\n\nThis equation becomes identical, if we assume \\( n = m \\) or \\( n = m + 1 \\), and\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{m}{n}, \\quad B = \\frac{m}{n(n+1)}, \\quad C = \\frac{m}{n(n+1)(n+2)}, \\quad D = \\frac{m}{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}, \\quad \\&c. \\]\n\nHence we have\n\n\\[ y = m \\left\\{ \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} - \\frac{x^{n+2}}{(n+1)(n+2)} + \\frac{x^{n+3}}{(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)} + \\&c. \\right\\}. \\]\n\nIn order that a primitive equation may be general, it ought to contain an indeterminate constant quantity more than is found in the fluxional equation, therefore, this series which contains no such quantity, must be considered as incomplete, or as exhibiting the value of \\( y \\) upon the supposition, that, when \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( y = 0 \\).\n\nHowever, we may obtain a value of \\( y \\) that shall be general,\nPart II.","sp":387,"ep":399},{"h":"WATER IS FREED FROM VARIOUS IMPURITIES BY","t":"r is freed from various impurities by means of basins made of porous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, which vessels must be peculiarly beneficial in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> voyages, and even upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> they are of considerable benefit, when none but stagnant waters are to be found, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> issuing through clay.\n\nA patent was granted in 1790 to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> potter, for inventing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> to make filtering basins, as a succedaneum for that porous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> which is not every where to be found.

The filtering surface remains the same, while the dimensions of the chamber in which the sediment is received may be varied.

Let a circle be described on \\( F \\) as a centre with a rad. \\( = 1 \\), then \\( FP \\), as also the area \\( FAP \\) may be considered as functions of \\( BD \\) the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of that circle which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> the angle \\( PFA \\).

On \\( F \\) as a centre, with \\( FP \\) as a radius, describe an arch of a circle meeting \\( FP' \\) in \\( Q \\), then, as the sectors \\( FDD' \\), \\( FPQ \\) are similar, we have\n\n\\[\nFD^2 : FP^2 :: FD \\times DD' : FP \\times PQ = 2 \\text{ feet.

Let us take for example the spiral of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a>, which may be defined thus. Conceive a straight line \\( FR \\) to revolve about \\( F \\) the centre of a given circle, departing from a given position \\( FB \\); conceive also a point \\( P \\) to move in the revolving line, so that \\( PF \\) its distance from the centre may be to \\( BD \\) the arch of the circle passed over by the revolving line, as \\( m \\) to \\( n \\), then the point \\( P \\) will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> the spiral.\n\nPut \\( BF = a \\), the angle \\( BFR = v \\), the line \\( FP = r \\), and the area <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by the line \\( FP = s \\), then the arch \\( BD = v \\), and since from the nature of the curve \\( r : av :: m : n \\), therefore \\( v = \\frac{nr}{am} \\), and \\( \\dot{v} = \\frac{nr}{am^2} \\); hence\n\nthe general formula \\( \\dot{s} = \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\dot{v} \\) becomes \\( \\dot{s} = \\frac{nr^2}{2am} \\),\n\ntherefore,\n\n\\[\ns = \\int \\frac{n r^2}{2am} = \\frac{nr^3}{6am}\n\\]\n\nthis fluent does not require a constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> to be added,\n156. As the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> for a curvilinear area BCPD is $\\int y \\cdot x$, where $x = <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a>$ the abscissa reckoned from a given point A in the axis and $y = BC$ the ordinate, it follows that X being put to denote any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of a variable quantity $x$, the fluent of $X \\cdot x$ may always be exhibited by means of a curvilinear area. Thus let CP be a curve of such a nature that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">AD</a> and DP the co-ordinates being denoted by $x$ and $y$, the equation of the curve is $y = X$, then, affixing any ordinate BC as given by position, we have evidently\n\n$$\\int X \\cdot x = \\text{area CBDP}.$$  \n\nAs the ordinate BC (which is assumed as given by position) may be taken anywhere, the fraction of the area being the same wherever it is taken, it appears, as has been already observed (\u00a7 101) that the function $\\int X \\cdot x$ may be considered as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">indeterminate</a>, for it admits of innumerable values corresponding to any particular value of $x$, and in this respect it differs from an algebraic function, which for a given value of $x$ has always a determinate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of values. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> however $x$ be supposed to increase from any determinate magnitude $a$, to any other determinate magnitude $a'$, then, taking the abscissa AD = $a$, and A d = $a'$, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> the ordinates DP, $d_p$, we have\n\nwhen $x = a$, $\\int X \\cdot x = \\text{area CBDP}$,\n\nand when $x = a'$, $\\int X \\cdot x = \\text{area CBdP}$,\n\ntherefore, while $x$ increases from $a$ to $a'$, or receives the increment $a' - a$, the function $\\int X \\cdot x$ increases from area CBDP to area CBdP, and thus receives the increment area PD $d_p$, which is of a determinate magnitude as the ordinates PD, $d_p$ have both a determinate position.\n\nHence it appears that in affixing the fluent of $X \\cdot x$, we only determine the change that takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the value of the function $\\int X \\cdot x$ while $x$ passes from one particular value to another particular value.\n\n157. As there are general and known methods by which an approximate value of any curvilinear area may be found, when a fluent is expressed by such an area, those methods may be applied to find an approximate value of the fluent. Let PD $d_p$ be a curvilinear area, supposed to represent the fluent $\\int X \\cdot x$ between the limits of $x = AD$ and $x = A.d$. Conceive D$d$ to be divided into a number of equal parts DD', D'D'', D'd', and the ordinates PD', P'D'' drawn, and the two sets of parallelograms DE, D'E', D''E'' and D'e', d'e' to be completed, the former constituting a rectilineal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> circumscribed about the curvilinear space DPP'D'P'd', and the latter a rectilineal figure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> in that space; then as the circumscribed figure must necessarily be greater than the curvilinear space, that is, greater than\n\n$$\\int X \\cdot x \\text{ taken between the limits of } x = AD \\text{ and } x = A.d,$$\n\nand the inscribed figure must be less, it follows that if we compute the areas of the circumscribed and inscribed figures we shall obtain two limits, the one greater, and the other less than $\\int X \\cdot x$. And as by increasing the number of equal parts into which D$d$ is divided we may bring the circumscribed and inscribed rectilineal figures as near to a ratio of equality as we please, it is always possible to find two limits which shall differ from each other, and consequently from $\\int X \\cdot x$ (which lies between them) by less than any assignable quantity.\n\n158. If we join P, P', P'', P, the tops of the ordinates, the rectilineal space formed by the trapeziums DPP'D', D'P'P''D'', D''P''P'd' will be more nearly equal to the curvilinear area, than the circumscribed rectilineal figure formed by the parallelograms DE, D'E', D''E''; therefore the sum of those trapeziums being found, it will be equal to the fluent $\\int X \\cdot x$ nearly.\n\nSuppose, for example, that it is required to find the value of $\\int \\frac{x}{1 + x^2}$ between the limits of $x = 0$, and $x = 1$.\n\nIn this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> $X = \\frac{1}{1 + x^2}$, so that the equation of the curve $P_p$ is $y = \\frac{1}{1 + x^2}$; let us suppose $D_d$ the distance between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> ordinates to be divided into ten equal parts, then putting 0, '1, '2, &c. to 1 instead of $x$ in the formula $y = \\frac{1}{1 + x^2}$, we obtain eleven successive values of $y$, or eleven equidistant ordinates, the numerical values of which will be as follows,\n\n| The first | 1.00000 |\n|----------|---------|\n| the 2d   | .99010  |\n| the 3d   | .96154  |\n| the 4th  | .91743  |\n| the 5th  | .86207  |\n| the 6th  | .80000  |\n| the 7th  | .73529  |\n| the 8th  | .67114  |\n| the 9th  | .60975  |\n| the 10th | .55249  |\n| the 11th | .50000  |\n\nBy the elements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a> the area of the rectilineal figure formed by the trapeziums is found by adding together all the ordinates except the first and last, and half the sum of the first and last, and multiplying that sum by the breadth of one of the trapeziums; now the sum of the ordinates, with the exception of the first and last, together with half the sum of the first and last, is 7.84981, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> breadth of the trapeziums is '1, therefore $\\int \\frac{x}{1 + x^2} = 7.84981 \\times '1 = '785$ nearly, as required. It is evident from \u00a7 137, that $\\int \\frac{x}{1 + x^2}$ taken between the limits of $x = 0$, and $x = 1$, is accurately equal to an arch of 45\u00b0, radius being unity, which arch being $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi$ will be found = '7854 nearly.\n\nIf we recur to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> which has been found to express the above fluent in \u00a7 137, and put $a = 1$, and $x = 1$, we shall have $\\int \\frac{x}{1 + x^2}$ taken between the prescribed limits equal to\nIt is impossible however to compute the fluent simply by the addition of the terms of this series, on account of the slowness of its convergency.\n\n159. As the curvilinear area $DP\\cdot d$ is the limit of the sum of the parallelograms $DP', DP'', \\ldots$, which constitute the rectilineal figure inscribed in that area; as also the limit of the sum of the parallelograms $DE, DE', DE'', \\ldots$, which constitute the circumscribed figure, the number of parts into which $D\\cdot d$ is divided being in either case conceived to be increased indefinitely, so that each may be continually diminished (and this being the case it is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> whether those parts be conceived as all equal or as unequal) so from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> we may conclude that if $x', x'', x''', \\ldots x^{(n)}$ be put to denote successive values of a variable quantity $x$, and $X', X'', X''', \\ldots X^{(n)}$ the corresponding values of $X$ any function of $x$, the limit of the sum of the products $X(x' - x), X(x'' - x'), X(x''' - x''), \\ldots$, &c., when the number of successive values of $x$ and $X$ is continually increased, so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between any two of them immediately following each other may be continually diminished, is equal to $\\int X\\cdot dx$, the fluent to be taken between the two extreme values of $x$.\n\n160. It was in this manner that the first writers on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENTIAL\">differential</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a> conceived a fluent; as the difference between any two of its succeeding values is the product of the function $X$ by $x' - x$ the increment of $x$; they called that product (when $x' - x$ was conceived to be infinitely diminished) the Differential of the fluent; and as the fluent is the sum of all the products, or differentials, instead of calling it a fluent they called it an Integral; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> by which an integral is found from its differential or fluxion they called Integration. The terms Integral and Integration are sometimes employed by writers in applying the method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUXIONS\">fluxions</a> to mathematical enquiries.\n\nTo find the Lengths of Curves.\n\n161. It has been shewn in \u00a7 63, that if the abscissa of a curve be denoted by $x$, the ordinate by $y$, and the curve line by $z$, then $z = \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}$, hence the general formula for finding the length of a curve is\n\n$$z = \\int \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}.$$  \n\nTherefore, if from the equation expressing the nature of a curve we find the value of $y$ in terms of $x'$ and $x$, or else the value of $x'$ in terms of $y$ and $y'$, and substitute the one or the other in the above general formula, we shall obtain a fluxion the fluent of which will be the length of the curve.\n\nEx. 1. Suppose the curve to be a parabola, and that $AB = x$, $BP = y$, the arch $AP = z$, the parameter $= a$, then the equation of the curve being $ax = y^2$, we have\n\n$$x = \\frac{2yy}{a},$$  \n\nand\n\n$$z = \\int \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}.$$  \n\nThis fluent can only be expressed by an infinite series, under which form it has been already exhibited in \u00a7 149, the radius being there supposed unity.\n\nEx. 2. Suppose the curve to be a circle, and that $C$ Fig. 20 is its centre, and $AE$ a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a> of the circle. Put $CB = x$, $BP = y$, the arch $EP = z$, the radius of the circle $= a$, then $x^2 + y^2 = a^2$, and $y = \\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)}$, and\n\n$$y = \\frac{-xx}{\\sqrt{(a^2 - x^2)}},$$  \n\nhence\n\n$$z = \\int \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)} = \\int \\sqrt{(x^2 + \\frac{x^2}{a^2 - x^2})}.$$  \n\nEx. 3.

To simplify the calculation, let us suppose that the semi-transverse axis $AC = a$; put the semi-conjugate axis $CE = b$, the eccentricity (that is $\\sqrt{(1 - b^2)} = e$, the abscissa $CB = x$, the ordinate $PB = y$, the arch $EP = z$; then, the equation of the curve being $y^2 = b^2(1 - x^2)$, we have\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">Part</a> II.\n\nInverse Method, have \\( y = b \\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\), and \\( y' = \\frac{-b x}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \\), and therefore\n\n\\[ z = \\int \\sqrt{x^2 + y'^2} = \\int \\sqrt{x^2 + \\frac{b^2 x^2}{1 - x^2}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\int \\frac{x \\sqrt{1 - e^2 x^2}}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \\]","sp":384,"ep":387}]
