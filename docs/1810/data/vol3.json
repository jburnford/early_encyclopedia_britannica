Several ancient writers, in particular Ctesias and Diodorus Siculus, have affirmed, that the Assyrian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>, under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINUS\">Ninus</a> and Semiramis, comprehended the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the known world. Had this been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, it is not likely that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a> would have omitted a fact so remarkable. The sacred records intimate, that none of the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> kingdoms were of considerable extent; for neither Chedrauomer, nor any of the neighbouring princes, were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIBUTARY\">tributary</a> or subject to Assyria; and we find nothing of the greatness or power of this kingdom in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the judges and succeeding kings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISRAEL\">Israel</a>, though the latter kingdom was oppressed and enslaved by many different powers in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>. It is highly probable, therefore, that Assyria was originally of small extent. According to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>, it was bounded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMENIA\">Armenia</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a>; on the west by the Tigris; on the south by Susiana; and on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> by Media.\n\nIt is probable, that the origin and revolutions of the Assyrian monarchy were as follows.\u2014The founder of it was Ashur, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> son of Shem, who went out of Shinar, either by the appointment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIMROD\">Nimrod</a>, or to elude the fury of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>; conducted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> body of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ADVENTURERS\">adventurers</a> into Assyria, and laid the foundation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINEVEH\">Nineveh</a> (Gen. x. 11.) These events happened not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> after Nimrod had established the Chaldaean monarchy, and fixed his residence at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLON\">Babylon</a>. The Persian historians suppose that the kings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a> of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYNASTY\">dynasty</a> were the same with the kings of Assyria, of whom Zohah, or Nimrod, was the founder of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BABEL\">Babel</a>. (Herbelot Orient. Bibl. v. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAGDAD\">Bagdad</a>.) It does not, however, appear that Nimrod reigned in Assyria. The kingdoms of Babylon and Assyria were originally distinct and separate (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MICAH\">Micah</a>, v. 6.); and in this state they remained until Ninus conquered Babylon and made it tributary to the Assyrian empire. Ninus the successor of Ashur (Gen. x. 11., Diod. Sic. lib. i.), seized on Chaldea, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Nimrod, and united the kingdoms of Assyria and Babylon. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> is said to have subdued Asia, Persia, Media, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, &c. If he did so, the effects of his conquests were of no duration; for in the days of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a>, we do not find that any of the neighbouring kingdoms were subject to Assyria. He was succeeded by Semiramis; a princess of an heroic mind; bold, enterprising, fortunate; but of whom many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol8.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a> things have been recorded. It appears, however, that there were two princesses of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, who flourished at very different periods. One of them was the consort of Ninus; and the other lived five generations before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NITOCRIS\">Nitocris</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol16.html#article-NEBUCHADNEZZAR\">Nebuchadnezzar</a> (Euseb. Chron. p. 58, Herod. lib. i. c. 184.). This fact has not been attended to by many writers.\n\nWhether there was an uninterrupted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of kings from Ninus to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDANAPALUS\">Sardanapalus</a>, or not, is still a question. Some suspicion has arisen, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIST\">list</a> which Ctesias has given of the Assyrian kings is not genuine; for many names in it are of Persian, Egyptian, and Grecian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a>.\n\nNothing memorable has been recorded concerning the successors of Ninus and Semiramis. Of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFEMINATE\">effeminate</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of princes it is barely said, that they ascended the throne, lived in indolence, and died in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> at Nineveh. Diodorus (lib. ii.) relates, that, in the reign of Teutames, the Assyrians, solicited by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIAM\">Priam</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VASSAL\">vassal</a>, sent to the Trojans a supply of 20,000 foot and 200 chariots, under the command of Memnon, son of Tithonus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> of Persia: But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of his relation is rendered doubtful by the accounts of other writers.\n\nSardanapalus was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> of the ancient Assyrian kings. Contemning his indolent and voluptuous course of life, Arbaces, governor of Media, withdrew his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a>, and rose up in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REBELLION\">rebellion</a> against him. He was encouraged in this revolt by the advice and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> of Belisis, a Chaldean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>, who engaged the Babylonians to follow the example of the Medes. These powerful provinces, aided by the Persians and other allies, who despised the effeminacy, or dreaded the tyranny of their Assyrian lords, attacked the empire on all sides. Their most vigorous efforts were, in the beginning, unsuccessful. Firm and determined, however, in their opposition, they at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> prevailed, defeated the Assyrian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, besieged Sardanapalus in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, which they demolished, and became masters of the empire, B.C. 821.\n\nAfter the death of Sardanapalus, the Assyrian empire was divided into three kingdoms, viz. the Median, Assyrian, and Babylonian. Arbaces retained the supreme power and authority, and fixed his residence at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECBATANA\">Ecbatana</a> in Media. He nominated governors in Assyria and Babylon, who were honoured with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of kings, while they remained subject and tributary to the Median monarchs. Belisis received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of Babylon as the reward of his services; and Phul was intrusted with that of Assyria. The Assyrian governor gradually enlarged the boundaries of his kingdom, and was succeeded by Tiglath-pileser, Salmanasar, and Sennacherib, who asserted and maintained their independency. After the death of Asar-haddon, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> and successor of Sennacherib, the kingdom of Assyria was split, and annexed to the kingdoms of Media and Babylon. Several tributary princes afterwards reigned in Nineveh; but no particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of them is found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANNALS\">annals</a> of ancient nations.

He is styled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELSHAZZAR\">Belshazzar</a> in the sacred records, and was conquered by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CYRUS\">Cyrus</a>, B.C. 538.\n\nASSYRIAM.

It may farther be remarked, that it deserves to be mentioned, that about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> ago a lady informed the public by her pen, that \"women, who ought to be retired, are for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> designed for speculation,\" and that \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> improvements might be made in the sciences, were not women enviously excluded from their proper business.\" Deeming her time more valuable than to be walled by trifling visitors, and abhorring the practice of\nof teaching servants to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a>, she would humorously accost such visitors by saying, \"Mrs Attell is not at home.\" (Gen.

See Falco, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORNITHOLOGY\">Ornithology</a> Index.\n\nASTERIA is also the name of a gem, usually called the cat's eye, or oculus cati. It is a very singular and very beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, and somewhat approaches to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the opal, in having a bright included <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, which seems to be lodged deep in the body of the stone, and shifts about, as it is moved, in various directions; but it differs from the opal in all other particulars, especially in its want of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> variety of colours seen in that gem, and in its superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a>.

It is found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">East</a> and West Indies, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.

The fossils are small, short, angular, or suctated columns, between one and two inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, and seldom above a third of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>; composed of several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>; when separated, each resembles a radiated star. They are, not without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, supposed to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-fish petrified, probably the asterias or sea-star. The asteria is also called astreites, astrotites, and astereus. They may be reduced to two kinds: those whose whole bodies make the form of a star; and those which in the whole are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>, but are adorned as it were with constellations in the parts. Dr Lister, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>'s sake, only, gives the name asteria to the former sort, distinguishing the latter by the appellation of astrotites; other naturalists generally use the two indiscriminately. The asteria spoken of by the ancients, appears to be of this latter kind. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of moving in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a>, as if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a>, is scarcely perceivable in the astrotites, but is signal in the asteria. The former must be broken in small pieces before it will move; but the latter will move, not only in a whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>, but in two or three knit together. The curious frequently meet with these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> in many parts of England: at Cleydon in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OXFORDSHIRE\">Oxfordshire</a> they are found rather larger than common, but of a softer substance; for, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> being left a small space of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> in a strong acid, they may easily be separated at the joints in small plates.","sp":10,"ep":10},{"h":"ASTERIAS","t":"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the bittern.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is rich and fertile; but the Tartars who inhabit it are strangers to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>. On the western and southern sides of the Volga are heaths of a prodigious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a>, and uncultivated; these, however, produce vast quantities of fine transparent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> in pits, where the sun bakes and incrustates it to the thickness of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> on the surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. There are pits in the neighbourhood of Astracan which yield this excellent salt in such abundance, that any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> may carry it off, paying at the rate of one farthing a poof, which is equal to forty pounds. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>, Astracan, is situated within the boundaries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> called Dolgoi, about 60 English miles above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where the Volga discharges itself into the Caspian sea. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> derives its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> from Hadjee Tarken, a Tartar, by whom it was founded. It was conquered by Ivan Basilowitsch, recovered by the Tartars in the year 1668, and retaken by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CZAR\">czar</a>, who employed for this purpose a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of flat-bottomed vessels, in which he transported his forces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the Volga from Cazan.\n\nThe city of Astracan is about two miles and a half in circumference, surrounded by a brick wall, which is now in a ruinous condition; but, if we comprehend the suburbs, the circuit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be near five miles. The number of inhabitants amounts to 70,000, including Armenians and Tartars, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as a few Persians and Indians. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARRISON\">garrison</a> consists of six regiments of the best Russian troops, who, when this place was alarmed from the side of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, had in the adjacent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> erected a great number of small batteries, to secure the fields, and obstruct the approach of the enemy. The houses of Astracan are built of wood, and generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> and inconvenient. The higher parts of the city command a prospect of the Volga, which is here about three miles in breadth, and exhibits a noble appearance. The marshy lands on the banks of it render the place very tickly in the summer; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, being impregnated with salt, is extremely fertile, and produces abundance of fruit, the immoderate use of which is attended with epidemic distempers. Sickness is likewise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of those annual changes in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> produced by the floods in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a>. All round the city of Astracan, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of two miles, are seen a great number of gardens, orchards, and vineyards, producing all sorts of herbs and roots. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol10.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a> are counted so delicious, that they are preserved in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, and transported to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a>-carriage at a prodigious expense; yet the wine of Astracan is very indifferent. The summer being generally dry, the inhabitants water their gardens by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> worked by wind <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> horses, which raise the water to the highest part of the garden, from whence it runs in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENCHES\">trenches</a> to refresh the roots of every single tree and plant. The neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> produces hares and partridges, plenty of quails in summer, with wild and water-fowl of all sorts in abundance.\n\nAbout ten miles below Astracan is a small island called Bojmaise, on which are built large storehouses for the salt, which is made about twelve miles to the eastward, and, being brought thither in boats, is conveyed up the Volga, in order to supply the country as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSCOW\">Moscow</a> and Tver. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of salt annually dug for these purposes amounts to some millions of pounds, the exclusive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of which is claimed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, and yields a considerable revenue; for the holders and bulk of the people live almost entirely on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> and salt. The neighbourhood of these salt-works is of great advantage to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a>, which extend from hence to the Caspian sea, and reach to the south-east as far as Yack, and even 100 miles above Zaritzen. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> fish here caught are sturgeon and beluga. These, being salted, are put on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> of vessels, and sent away in the spring, for the use of the whole empire, even as far as Petersburg; but as fish may be kept fresh as long as it is frozen, the winter is no sooner set in, than they transport great quantities of it by land through all the provinces of Russia. Of the roes of the fish called beluga, which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, transparent, and of an agreeable flavour, the fishers here prepare the caviare, which is in so much esteem all over Europe. These fisheries were first established by one Tikon Demedoff, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRIER\">carrier</a>, who settled in this place about 60 years ago, his whole wealth consisting of two horses. By dint of skill and industry, he soon grew the richest merchant in this country; but his success became so alluring to the crown, that of late years it hath engrossed some of the fisheries as well as the salt-works.\n\nFrom the latter end of July to the beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a>, the country about Astracan is frequently infested with myriads of locusts, which darken the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROGRESSION\">progression</a> from the north to the southward; and, wherever they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, consume the whole verdure of the earth. These insects can even live for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> under water; for when the wind blows across the Volga, vast numbers of them fall in clutters, and are rolled ashore; and their wings are no sooner dry, than they rise and take flight again.\n\nHeretofore the inhabitants of Astracan traded to Khuva and Bokhara; but at present these branches are lost, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> is limited to Persia and the dominions of Russia. Even the trade to Persia is much diminished by the troubles of that country; nevertheless, the commerce of Astracan is still considerable. Some years ago, the city maintained about 40 vessels, from 100 to 200 tons burden, for the Caspian traffic.

This office is generally well stocked with naval stores, which are sold occasionally to the merchants.

To ascertain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> motions of the heavenly bodies was a difficult task, and required the united observations of ages. To unravel these intricate mazes, and detect and demonstrate the real motions, demanded the most patient perseverance, judgment, and dexterity. To ascertain the laws of these motions, and to resolve the whole of them into one general fact, required the exertions of a sagacity scarcely to be expected in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>.

HISTORY OF ASTRONOMY.\n\nThe antiquity of this science may be gathered from what was spoken by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of creating the celestial luminaries, \"Let them be for signs and seasons,\" &c. whence it is thought probable that the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> never existed without some knowledge of astronomy among them. Indeed, besides the motives of mere curiosity, which of themselves may be supposed to have excited people to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of the glorious celestial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANOPY\">canopy</a>, as far as that was possible, it is easily to be seen that some parts of the science answer such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> purposes to mankind, that they could not possibly be dispensed with.\n\nBy some of the Jewish rabbins, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a>, in his state of innocence, is supposed to have been endowed with a knowledge of the nature, influence, and uses of the heavenly bodies; and Josephus attributes to Seth and his posterity an extensive knowledge of astronomy. But whatever may be in this, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> lives of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTEDILUVIANS\">Antediluvians</a> certainly afforded such an excellent opportunity for observing the celestial bodies, that we cannot but suppose the science of astronomy to have been considerably advanced before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>. Josephus says, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONGEVITY\">longevity</a> was bestowed upon them for the very purpose of improving the sciences of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a> and astronomy. The latter could not be learned in less than 600 years: \"for that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> (says he) is the grand year.\" By which it is supposed he meant the period wherein the sun and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> came again into the same situation as they were in the beginning thereof, with regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NODES\">nodes</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOGEE\">apogee</a> of the moon, &c. \"This period (says Caffini), whereof we find no intimation in any monument of any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, is the finest period that ever was invented: for it brings out the solar year more exactly than that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HIPPARCHUS\">Hipparchus</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> within about one second of what is determined by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> astronomers. If the Antedilu-\nvians had such a period of 600 years, they must have known the motions of the sun and moon more exactly than their descendants knew them some ages after the flood.\"\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">On</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of the tower of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BABEL\">Babel</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOAH\">Noah</a> is supposed to have retired with his children born after the flood, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-eastern part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, where his descendants peopled the vast empire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>. \"This (says Dr Long) may perhaps <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> for the Chinese having so early cultivated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of astronomy; their being so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> settled in an admirable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a>, and continuing so many hundred years as they did in the worship of the true God.\" The vanity of that people indeed has prompted them to pretend a knowledge of astronomy almost as early as the flood itself. Some of the Jesuit missionaries have found traditional accounts among the Chinese, of their having been taught this science by their first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Fo-hi, supposed to be Noah; and Kempfer informs us, that this personage discovered the motions of the heavens, divided time into years and months, and invented the twelve signs into which they divide the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZODIAC\">zodiac</a>, which they distinguish by the following names. 1. The mouse. 2. The ox or cow. 3. The tiger. 4. The hare. 5. The dragon. 6. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SERPENT\">serpent</a>. 7. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>. 8. The sheep. 9. The monkey. 10. The cock or hen. 11. The dog; and, 12. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOAR\">boar</a>. They divide the heavens into 28 constellations, four of which are assigned to each of the seven planets; so that the year always begins with the same planet; and their constellations answer to the 28 mansions of the moon used by the Arabian astronomers. These constellations, in the Chinese books of astronomy, are not marked by the figures of animals, as was in use among the Greeks, and from them derived to the other European nations, but by connecting the stars by straight lines: and Dr Long informs us, that in a Chinese book in thin 4to, shown him by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEMBROKE\">Pembroke</a>, the stars were represented by small circles joined by lines; so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">Great</a> Bear would be marked thus,\n\nTo the emperor Hong-ti, the grandson of Noah, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> the discovery of the pole-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of the mariner's compass, of a period of 60 years, and some kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> antiquity, however, is with good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> suspected, as is likewise their knowledge in the calculation of eclipses; of which Du Halde affirms us, that 36 are recorded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUCIUS\">Confucius</a> himself, who lived 551 years before Christ; and P. Trigault, who went to China in 1619, and read more than 100 volumes of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANNALS\">annals</a>, says, \"It is certain that the Chinese began to make astronomical observations soon after the flood; that they have observed a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of eclipses, in which they have noted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, month, and year, when they happened, but neither the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> nor the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>; and that these eclipses have been made use of for regulating their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">chronology</a>.\"\n\n\"But out of this abundance (says Dr Long), it is much to be regretted, that so very few of their observations have been particularized; for beside what has been mentioned above, we meet with no very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> observations of the Chinese, except a winter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLSTICE\">solstice</a> in the year 1111, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> solstice in the year 882, before Christ. Martini indeed speaks of a summer solstice 2342 years before that period. But M. Caffini, who calculated it, found that there must have been an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in the Chinese computation of 500 years at least. An error of equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> appears to have been committed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> of the five planets, which it is pretended they observed between the years 2513 and 2435 before Christ. In short, some have supposed, that none of these are real observations, but the result of bungling calculations; and it has been hinted, but surely on too slight a foundation, that even those good fathers themselves were greatly to be suspected. But let us come to things which are not contested.\n\n\"P. Gaubil informs us, that at least 120 years before Christ, the Chinese had determined by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> the number and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of their constellations as they now stand; the situation of the fixed stars with respect to the equinoctial and solstitial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>; and the obliquity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECLIPTIC\">ecliptic</a>. He farther says, he cannot tell by what means it is that they foretell eclipses: but this is certain, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> by which they do predict them was settled about the same time; and that they were acquainted with the true length of the solar year, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of observing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MERIDIAN\">meridian</a> altitudes of the sun by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GNOMON\">gnomon</a>, and of learning from thence his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECLINATION\">declination</a> and the height of the pole, long before. We learn, moreover, from the same missionary, that there are yet remaining among them some treatises of astronomy, which were written about 200 years before Christ; from which it appears, that the Chinese had known the daily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the sun and moon, and the times of the revolutions of the planets, many years before that period.\n\n\"We are informed by Du Halde, that, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Honan, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> Teng-foang, which is nearly in the middle of China, there is a tower, on the top of which it is said that Tcheou-cong, the most skilful astronomer that ever China produced, made his observations. He lived 1200 years before Ptolemy, or more than 1000 years before Christ, and passed whole nights in observing the celestial bodies and arranging them into constellations. He used a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> placed perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a>, on which was fixed a long upright plate of the same metal, both of which were divided into degrees, &c. By these he marked the meridian altitudes; and from thence derived the times of the solstices, which were their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> epochs.\"\n\nDr Long represents the state of astronomy in China as at present very low; occasioned, he says, principally by the barbarous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> of one of their emperors*, to have all the books in the empire burnt, excepting such as related to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> and medicine. We are informed, however, by the Abbe Grofier, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of China, that astronomy is cultivated in Pekin in the same manner as in most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> cities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. A particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a> is established there, the jurisdiction of which extends to every thing relating to the observation of celestial phenomena. Its members are, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPECTOR\">inspector</a>; two presidents, one of them a Tartar and the other a Chinese; and a certain number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANDARINS\">mandarins</a> who perform the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> of assessors; but for near a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> and a half the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of the Chinese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> has been filled by an European. Since that time particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> has been paid to\nPart I.\n\nThe instruction of the astronomical pupils; and the presidents have always considered it as their duty to make them acquainted with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> and method of calculation made use of in Europe. Thus two-thirds of the astronomical pupils, maintained at the emperor's expense, in all about 200, have a tolerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of the state of the heavens, and understand calculation so well as to be able to compose ephemerides of sufficient exactness. The missionaries have never been the authors of any of these ephemerides; their employment is to revise the labours of the Chinese mathematicians, verify their calculations, and correct any errors into which they have fallen. The Portuguese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MISSION\">mission</a> still continues to furnish astronomers for the academy, as it did at the first.\n\nThe astronomical tribunal is subordinate to that of ceremonies. When an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECLIPSE\">eclipse</a> is to be observed, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> must be given to the emperor of the day and hour, the part of the heavens where it will be, &c., and this intelligence must be communicated some months before it happens; the eclipse must also be calculated for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a> of the capital city of every province of the empire. These observations, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DIAGRAM\">diagram</a> which represents the eclipse, are preserved by the tribunal of ceremonies, and another called the calao, by whom it is transmitted to the different provinces and cities of the empire. Some days before the eclipse, the tribunal of ceremonies causes to be fixed up in a public place, in large characters, the hour and minute when the eclipse will commence, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the heavens in which it will be visible, with the other particulars relating to it. The mandarins are summoned to appear in state at the tribunal of astronomy, and to wait there for the moment in which the phenomenon will take place. Each of them carries in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> a sheet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, containing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of the eclipse and every circumstance attending it. As soon as the observation begins to take place, they throw themselves on their knees, and knock their heads against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and a horrid noise of drums and cymbals immediately commences throughout the whole city: a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> proceeding from an ancient superstitious notion, that by such a noise they prevented the luminary from being devoured by the celestial dragon; and though this notion is now exploded in China, as well as everywhere else, such is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> of the people to ancient customs, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONIAL\">ceremonial</a> is still preserved. While the mandarins thus remain prostrated in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, others, stationed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">observatory</a>, examine, with all the attention possible, the beginning, middle, and end of the eclipse, comparing what they observe with the figure and calculations given. They then write down their observations, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFIX\">affix</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a> to them, and transmit them to the emperor; who, on his part, has been no less anxious to observe the eclipse with accuracy. A ceremonial of this kind is observed throughout the whole empire.\n\nThe Japanese, Siamese, and inhabitants of the Mogul's empire, have also, from time immemorial, been acquainted with astronomy; and the celebrated observatory at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENARES\">Benares</a>, is a monument both of the ingenuity of the people and of their skill in this science.\n\nMr Bailly has been at great pains to investigate the progress of the Indians in astronomical knowledge, and gives a splendid account of their proficiency in the science, as well as of the antiquity of their observations. He has examined and compared four different astronomical tables of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> philosophers. 1. Of the Siamese, explained by M. Caffini in 1639. 2. Those brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> by M. le Gentil of the Academy of Sciences. 3. and 4. Two other manuscript tables found among the papers of the late M. de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LISLE\">Lisle</a>. All of these tables have different epochs, and differ in form, being also constructed in different ways; yet they all evidently belong to the same astronomical system: the motions attributed to the sun and the moon are the same, and the different epochs are so well connected by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> motions, as to demonstrate that they had only one, whence the others were derived by calculation. The meridians are all referred to that of Benares above-mentioned. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> epoch of the Indian astronomy is a conjunction of the sun and moon, which took place at no less a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of time than 3102 years before the Christian era. Mr Bailly informs us, that, according to our most accurate astronomical tables, a conjunction of the sun and moon actually did happen at that time. But though the brahmins pretend to have ascertained the places of the two luminaries at that time, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> for us at this time to judge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of their assertions, by reason of the unequal motion of the moon; which, as shall afterwards be more particularly taken notice of, now performs its revolution in a shorter time than formerly.\n\nOur author informs us, that the Indians at present calculate eclipses by the mean motions of the sun and moon observed 5000 years ago; and with regard to the solar motion, their accuracy far exceeds that of the best Grecian astronomers. The lunar motions they had also settled, by computing the space through which that luminary had passed in 1,600,984 days, or somewhat more than 4383 years. They also make use of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CYCLE\">cycle</a> of 19 years attributed by the Greeks to Meton; and their theory of the planets is much better than that of Ptolemy, as they do not suppose the earth to be the centre of the celestial motions, and they believe that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENUS\">Venus</a> turn round the sun. Mr Bailly also informs us, that their astronomy agrees with the most modern discoveries of the decrease of the obliquity of the ecliptic, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a> of the motion of the equinoctial points, with many other particulars too tedious to enumerate in this place.\n\nIt appears also, that even the Americans were not unacquainted with astronomy, though they made use of the only of the solar, and not of the lunar motions, in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of time. The Mexicans have had a strange predilection for the number 13. Their shortest periods consisted of 13 days; their cycle of 13 months, each containing 20 days; and their century of four periods of 13 years each. This excessive veneration for the number 13, according to Siguenza, arose from its being supposed the number of their greater gods. What is very surprising, though asserted as a fact by Albe Clavigero, is that having discovered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> in the solar above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CIVIL_YEAR\">civil year</a>, they made use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERCALARY\">intercalary</a> days, to bring them to an equality: but with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in regard to the method established by Julius Caesar in the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALENDAR\">calendar</a>, that they did not interpose a day every four years, but 13 days (making use here even of this favourite number)\nAmong those nations who first began to make any figure in ancient history, we find the Chaldeans and Egyptians most remarkable for their astronomical knowledge. Both of them pretended to an extravagant antiquity, and disputed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of having been the first cultivators of the science. The Chaldeans boasted of their temple of Belus; and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZOROASTER\">Zoroaster</a>, whom they placed 5000 years before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a>: the Egyptians boasted of their colleges of priests, where astronomy was taught; and of the monument of Olympos, in which we are told was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> circle 365 cubits in circumference and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CUBIT\">cubit</a> thick. The upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a> was divided into 365 equal parts, answering to the days of the year; and on every division were written the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the day, and the heliacal rising of the several stars for that day, with the prognostications from their rising, principally, as Long conjectures, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>.\n\nThe Chaldeans certainly began to make observations very soon after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> of languages; for when Alexander the Great took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLON\">Babylon</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALLISTHENES\">Callisthenes</a>, by his order, inquired after the astronomical observations recorded in that city, and obtained them for 1903 years back. Nothing, however, now remains of the Chaldean astronomy, excepting some periods of years which they had formed for the more ready computation of the heavenly bodies. But though they must have laboured under great disadvantages, for want of proper instruments, in those early ages, Gemina, as quoted by Petavius in his Uranologia, informs us, that they had determined, with tolerable exactness, the length both of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYNODICAL\">synodical</a> and periodical month. They had also discovered, that the motion of the moon was not uniform, and even attempted to assign those parts of her orbit in which it was quicker or slower. Ptolemy also assures us, that they were not unacquainted with the motion of the moon's nodes, and that of her apogee, supposing that the former made a complete revolution in 6;85;4 days, or 18 years 15 days and 8 hours; which period, containing 223 complete lunations, is called the Chaldean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAROS\">Saros</a>. The same author also gives us, from Hipparchus, several observations of lunar eclipses which had been made at Babylon about 720 years before Christ; but though he might very probably meet with many of a more ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>, it was impossible to mention them particularly, on account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> state of the Chaldean chronology, which commenced only with the era of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NABONASSAR\">Nabonassar</a>, 747 years before Christ. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> likewise informs us, that they had many observations of the occultations of fixed stars and planets by the moon; and from hence, by a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> and easy inference, they were led to conclude that the eclipses of the sun were occasioned also by the moon, especially as they constantly happened when the latter was in the same part of the heavens with the sun. They had also a considerable share in arranging the stars into constellations. Nor had the comets, by which astronomers in all ages have been so much perplexed, escaped their observation: for both Diodorus Siculus and Appollonius Myndius, in Seneca, inform us, that many of the Chaldeans held these to be lasting bodies, which have stated revolutions as well as the planets, but in orbits vastly more extensive; on which account they are only seen by us while near the earth, but disappear again when they go into the higher regions. Others of them were of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that the comets were only meteors raised very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, which blaze for a while, and disappear when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of which they consist is consumed or dispersed. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DIALLING\">Dialling</a> was also known among them long before the Greeks were acquainted with any such thing.\n\nIt is evident, indeed, that the countries both of Chaldea and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> were exceedingly proper for astronomical observations, on account of the general purity and serenity of the air. The tower or temple of Belus, which was of an extraordinary height, with stairs winding round it up to the top, is supposed to have been an astronomical observatory; and the lofty pyramids of Egypt, whatever they were originally designed for, might possibly answer the same purpose. Indeed these very ancient monuments show the skill of this people in practical astronomy, as they are all situated with their four fronts exactly facing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">cardinal</a> points. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a> ascribes the Egyptian knowledge in astronomy to Sothis, whom Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton makes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a>: but if this was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, he could not be the instructor of the Egyptians in astronomical matters, since we find that Moses, who lived 500 years before Solomon, was skilled in all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> of the Egyptians, in which we are undoubtedly to include astronomy.\n\nFrom the testimony of some ancient authors, we learn that they believed the earth to be spherical, that they knew the moon was eclipsed by falling into its shadow, and that they made their observations with the greatest exactness. They even pretended to foretell the appearance of comets, as well as earthquakes and inundations; which extraordinary knowledge is likewise ascribed to the Chaldeans. They attempted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the magnitude of the earth and the sun; but the methods they took to find out the latter were very erroneous. It does not indeed appear with certainty that they had any knowledge of the true system of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>; and by the time of the emperor Augustus, their astronomical knowledge was entirely lost.\n\nFrom Chaldea the science of astronomy most probably passed into Phenicia; though some are of opinion that the Phenicians derived their knowledge of this science from the Egyptians. They seem, however, to have been the first who applied astronomy to the purposes of navigation; by which they became masters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and of almost all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> in the world. They became adventurous in their voyages, steering their ships by one of the stars of the Little Bear; which being near the immovable point of the heavens called the Pole, is the most proper guide in navigation. Other nations made their observations by the Great Bear; which being too distant from the pole could not guide them in long voyages; and for this reason they never durst venture far from the coasts.\n\nThe first origin of astronomical knowledge among the Greeks is unknown. Sir Isaac Newton supposes that most of the constellations were invented about the time of the Argonautic expedition: but Dr Long is of opinion that many of them must have been of a much older date; and that the shepherds, who were certainly\nPart I.\n\nHistory.\n\nCertainly the first observers gave names to them according to their fancy; from whence the poets invented many of their fables. Several of the constellations are mentioned by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HESIOD\">Hesiod</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>, the two most ancient writers among the Greeks, who lived about 870 years before Christ; Hesiod defining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> to regulate the time of sowing and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> by the rising and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEIADES\">Pleiades</a>; and Homer informing us, that observations from the Pleiades, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORION\">Orion</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCTURUS\">Arcturus</a>, were used in navigation. Their astronomical knowledge, however, was greatly improved by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THALES\">Thales</a> the Milesian, who travelled into Egypt, and brought from thence the first principles of the science. He is said to have determined the height of the pyramids by measuring their shadows at the time the sun was 45 degrees high, and when of consequence the lengths of the shadows of objects are equal to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> heights. But his reputation was raised to the highest pitch among his countrymen, by the prediction of an eclipse, which happened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> at the time that the armies of Alyattes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Lydia, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CYAXARES\">Cyaxares</a> the Mede, were about to engage; and being regarded as an evil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OMEN\">omen</a> by both parties, inclined them to peace. To him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALLIMACHUS\">Callimachus</a> attributes the forming of the constellation of the Little Bear; the knowledge of which he certainly introduced into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>. He also taught the true length of the year; determined the comical setting of the Pleiades in his time to have been 25 days after the autumnal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUINOX\">equinox</a>; divided the earth into five zones by means of the polar circles and tropics; taught the obliquity of the ecliptic; and showed that the equinoctial is cut by the meridians at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, all of which intersect each other at the poles. He is also said to have observed the exact time of the solstices, and from thence to have deduced the true length of the solar year; to have observed eclipses of the sun and moon; and to have taught that the moon had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> but what she borrowed from the sun. According to Stanley, he also determined the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> of the sun to be one-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a> part of its annual orbit.\n\n\"But (says Dr Long) these things should be received with caution. There are some reasons which might be assigned for supposing that the knowledge of Thales in these matters was much more circumferenced; and indeed it is not unreasonable to suppose, that that veneration for the ancients which leads authors to write profusely on the history of ancient times, may have induced them to ascribe full as much knowledge to them who lived in them as was really their due.\"\n\nThe successors of Thales, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANAXIMANDER\">Anaximander</a>, Anaximenes, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANAXAGORAS\">Anaxagoras</a>, contributed considerably to the advancement of astronomy. The first is said to have invented or introduced the gnomon into Greece; to have observed the obliquity of the ecliptic; and taught that the earth was spherical, and the centre of the universe, and that the sun was not less than it. He is also said to have made the first globe, and to have set up a sun-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DIAL\">dial</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LACEDEMON\">Lacedemon</a>, which is the first we hear of among the Greeks; though some are of opinion that these pieces of knowledge were brought from Babylon by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PHERECYDES\">Pherecydes</a>, a contemporary of Anaximander. Anaxagoras also predicted an eclipse which happened in the fifth year of the Peloponnesian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>; and taught that the moon was habitable, consisting of hills, valleys, and waters, like the earth. His contemporary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a>, however, greatly improved not only astronomy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, but every other branch of philosophy. He taught that the universe was composed of four elements, and that it had the sun in the centre; that the earth was round, and had antipodes; and that the moon reflected the rays of the sun; that the stars were worlds, containing earth, air, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a>; that the moon was inhabited like the earth; and that the comets were a kind of wandering stars, disappearing in the superior parts of their orbits, and becoming visible only in the lower parts of them. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of the milky-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> he ascribed to the brightness of a great number of small stars; and he supposed the distances of the moon and planets from the earth to be in certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONIC\">harmonic</a> proportions to one another. He is said also to have exhibited the oblique course of the sun in the ecliptic and the tropical circles, by means of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> sphere; and he first taught that the planet Venus is both the evening and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> star. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> is said to have been taken prisoner by Cambyses, and thus to have become acquainted with all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of the Persian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGI\">magi</a>; after which he settled at Crotona in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, and founded the Italian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>.\n\nAbout 445 years before the Christian era, Philolaus, a celebrated Pythagorean, affixed the annual motion of the earth round the sun; and soon after Hicetas, a Syracusan, taught its diurnal motion on its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a>. About this time also flourished Meton and Euctemon at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, who took an exact observation of the summer solstice 432 years before Christ; which is the oldest observation of the kind we have, excepting what is delivered by the Chalcide. Meton is said to have composed a cycle of 19 years, which still bears his name; and he marked the risings and settings of the stars, and what seasons they pointed out: in all which he was assisted by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> Euctemon. The science, however, was obscured by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> and Aristotle, who embraced the system afterwards called the Ptolemaic, which places the earth in the centre of the universe.\n\nEudoxus the Cnidian was a contemporary with Aristotle, though considerably older, and is greatly celebrated on account of his skill in astronomy. He was the first who introduced geometry into the science, and he is supposed to be the inventor of many propositions attributed to Euclid. Having travelled into Egypt in the earlier part of his life, and obtained a recommendation from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGATHIAS\">Agathias</a> to Nectanebus king of Egypt, he, by his means, got access to the priests, who had the knowledge of astronomy entirely among them; after which he taught in Asia and Italy. Seneca tells us that he brought the knowledge of the planetary motions from Egypt into Greece; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a>, that he believed the diameter of the sun to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> times that of the moon. He was also well acquainted with the method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> a sun-dial upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>; from whence it may be inferred that he understood the doctrine of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a> of the sphere: yet notwithstanding what has been said concerning the observations of Eudoxus, it is not certain that his sphere was not taken from one much more ancient, ascribed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIRON\">Chiron</a> the Centaur. The reason given for this supposition is, that had the places of the stars been taken from his own observations, the constellations must have been half a sign farther advanced than they are said to be in his writings.\nSoon after Eudoxus, Calippus flourished, whose system of the celestial sphere is mentioned by Aristotle; but he is better known from a period of 76 years, containing four corrected metonic periods, and which had its beginning at the summer solstice in the year 330 before Christ. But about this time, or rather earlier, the Greeks having begun to plant colonies in Italy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a>, and Egypt, these became acquainted with the Pythagorean system, and the notions of the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRUIDS\">Druids</a> concerning astronomy. Julius Caesar informs us, that the latter were skilled in this science; and that the Gauls in general were able sailors, which at that time they could not be without a competent knowledge of astronomy: and it is related of Pythoas, who lived at Marseille in the time of Alexander the Great, that he observed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> of the sun at the summer solstice by means of a gnomon. He is also said to have travelled as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THULE\">Thule</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> the climates.\n\nAfter the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Alexander the Great, sciences flourished in Egypt more than in any other part of the world; and a famous school was set up at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a> under the auspices of Ptolemy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PHILADELPHUS\">Philadelphus</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> instructed in all kinds of learning, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of all those who cultivated them; and this school <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be the seminary of all kinds of literature, till the invasion of the Saracens in 650. Timochares and Arystillus, who first cultivated the astronomical science in this school, began to put it on a new footing; being much more careful in their observations, and exact in noting down the times when they were made, than their predecessors. Ptolemy affirms us, that Hipparchus made use of their observations, by means of which he discovered that the stars had a motion in longitude of about one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> in an hundred years; and he cites many of their observations, the oldest of which is before the erection of this school, in the year 295, when the moon just touched the northern star in the forehead of the Scorpion; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> of them was in the 13th year of Philadelphus, when Venus hid the former star of the four in the left wing of Virgo.\n\nFrom this time the science of astronomy continued greatly to advance. Aristaechus, who lived about 270 years before Christ, strenuously affected the Pythagorean system, and gave a method of determining the distance of the sun by the moon's dichotomy. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ERATOSTHENES\">Eratosthenes</a>, born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CYRENE\">Cyrene</a> in 271 B.C., determined the measure of a great circle of the earth by means of a gnomon. His reputation was so great, that he was invited from Athens to Alexandria by Ptolemy Euergetes, and made by him keeper of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> library at that place. At his instigation the same prince set up those armillas or spheres, which Hipparchus and Ptolemy the astronomer afterwards employed to successfully in observing the heavens. He also found the distance between the tropics to be eleven such parts as the whole meridian contains eighty-three. About the same time Berossus, a native of Chaldea, flourished at Athens. He is by some said to have brought many observations from Babylon, which are ascribed to the Greeks; while others contend, that the latter owe little or nothing of their astronomical knowledge to the Babylonians. The celebrated Archimedes, who next to Sir Isaac Newton holds the first place among mathematicians, was nothing inferior as an astronomer to what he was as a geometer. He determined the distance of the moon from the earth, of Mercury from the moon, of Venus from Mercury, of the sun from Venus, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a> from the sun, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> from Mars, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a> from Jupiter; as likewise the distance of the fixed stars from the orbit of Saturn. That he made astronomical observations, is not to be doubted; and it appears from an epigram of the poet Claudian, that he invented a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANETARIUM\">planetarium</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORRERY\">orrery</a>, to represent the phenomena and motions of the heavenly bodies.\n\nHipparchus was the first who applied himself to the study of every part of astronomy, his predecessors having chiefly considered the motions and magnitudes of the sun and moon. Ptolemy also informs us, that he first discovered the orbits of the planets to be eccentric, and on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> wrote a book against Eudoxus and Calippus. He gives many of his observations; and says, that by comparing one of his with another made by Aristaechus 145 years before, he was enabled to determine the length of the year with great precision. Hipparchus also first found out the anticipation of the moon's nodes, the eccentricity of her orbit, and that she moved slower in her apogee than in her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIGEE\">perigee</a>. He collected the accounts of such ancient eclipses as had been observed by the Chaldeans and Egyptians. He formed hypotheses concerning the celestial motions, and constructed tables of those of the sun and moon, and would have done the same with those of the other planets if he could have found ancient observations sufficient for the purpose; but, these being wanting, he was obliged to content himself with collecting fit observations for that purpose, and endeavouring to form theories of the five planets. By comparing his own observations on the Spica Virginis with those of Timochares at Alexandria made 100 years before, he discovered that the fixed stars changed their places, and had a slow motion of their own from west to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a>. He corrected the Calippic period, and pointed out some errors in the method laid down by Eratothenes for measuring the circumference of the earth. By means of geometry, which was now greatly improved, he was enabled to attempt the calculation of the sun's distance in a more correct manner than any of his predecessors; but unhappily it required so much accuracy in observation as was found impracticable. His greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, however, was his catalogue of the fixed stars, which he was induced to attempt by the appearance of a new star. The catalogue of fixed stars is preferred by Ptolemy, and contains the longitudes and latitudes of 1022 stars, with their apparent magnitudes. He wrote also concerning the intervals between eclipses both solar and lunar, and is said to have calculated all that were to happen for no less than 600 years from his time.\n\nLittle progress was made in astronomy from the time of Hipparchus to that of Ptolemy, who flourished in Ptolemy, the first century. The principles on which his system is built are indeed erroneous; but his work will always be valuable on account of the number of ancient observations it contains. It was first translated out of the Greek into Arabic in the year 827, and into Latin from the Arabic in 1230. The Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> was unknown in Europe till the beginning of the 15th century.\nDuring the long period from the year 800 to the beginning of the 14th century, the western parts of Europe were immersed in deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> and barbarity. However, several learned men arose among the Arabians. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALIPH\">caliph</a> Al Mamun was the first who introduced a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for the sciences in his empire. His grandson Al Mamun, who ascended the throne in 814, was a great encourager of the sciences, and devoted much of his own time to the study of them. He made many astronomical observations himself, and determined the obliquity of the ecliptic to be $23^\\circ 35'$. He employed many able <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a> in constructing proper instruments, which he made use of for his observations; and under his auspices a degree of the earth was measured a second time in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of Singar, on the border of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-RED_SEA\"><a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> Sea. From this time astronomy was studiously cultivated by the Arabians; and Elements of Astronomy were written by Alferganus, who was partly contemporary with the caliph Al Mamun. But the most celebrated of all their astronomers is Albategnius, who lived about the year of Christ 880. He greatly reformed astronomy, by comparing his own observations with those of Ptolemy. Thus he calculated the motion of the sun's apogee from Ptolemy's time to his own; determined the precession of the equinoxes to be one degree in 70 years; and fixed the sun's greatest declination at $23^\\circ 35'$. Finding that the tables of Ptolemy required much correction, he composed new ones of his own fitted to the meridian of Alaracta, which were long held in estimation by the Arabians. After his time, though several eminent astronomers appeared among the Saracens, none made any very valuable observations for several centuries, excepting Ebn Younis astronomer to the caliph of Egypt; who observed three eclipses with such care, that by means of them we are enabled to determine the quantity of the moon's acceleration since that time.\n\nOther eminent Saracen astronomers were, Arzachel a Moor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, who observed the obliquity of the ecliptic, and constructed tables of sines, or half chords of double arcs, dividing the diameter into 300 parts; and Alkazen, his contemporary, who first showed the importance of the theory of refractions in astronomy; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> also upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TWILIGHT\">twilight</a>, the height of the clouds, and the phenomenon of the horizontal moon.\n\nUlug Beg, a grandson of the famous Tartar prince Timur Beg, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TAMERLANE\">Tamerlane</a>, was a great proficient in practical astronomy. He is said to have had very large instruments for making his observations; particularly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a> as high as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Sancta Sophia at Constantinople, which is 180 Roman feet. He composed astronomical tables from his own observations for the meridian of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMARCAND\">Samarcand</a> his capital, so exact as to differ very little from those afterwards constructed by Tycho Brahe; but his principal work is his catalogue of the fixed stars, made from his own observations in the year of Christ 1437. The accuracy of his observations may be gathered from his determining the height of the pole at Samarcand to be $35^\\circ 37' 23''$.\n\nBesides these improvements, we are indebted to the Arabians for the present form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">trigonometry</a>. Manetius, indeed, an eminent Greek astronomer who flourished about the year 90, had published three books of Spherics, in which he treated of the geometry necessary to astronomy, and which show great skill in the sciences; but his methods were very laborious, even after they had been improved and rendered more simple by Ptolemy: but Geber the Arabian, instead of the ancient method, proposed three or four theorems, which are the foundation of our modern trigonometry. The Arabians also made the practice still more simple, by using sines instead of the chords of double arcs. The arithmetical characters they had from the Indians.\n\nDuring the greatest part of this time, almost all Europe continued ignorant not only of astronomy but of every other science. The emperor Frederick II. first began to encourage learning in 1230; restoring some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a>, and founding a new one in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>. He also caused the works of Aristotle, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALMAGEST\">Almagest</a> or Astronomical Treatise of Ptolemy, to be translated into Latin; and from the translation of this book we may date the revival of astronomy in Europe. Two years after its publication, John de Sacro Bofco, or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HALIFAX\">Halifax</a>, an Englishman, wrote his four books De Sphera, which he compiled from Ptolemy Albategnius, Alferganus, and other Arabian astronomers: this work was so much celebrated, that for 300 years it was preferred in the schools to every other; and has been thought worthy of several commentaries, particularly by Clavius in 1531. In 1240, Alphonso king of Castile caused the tables of Ptolemy to be corrected: for which purpose he assembled many persons skilled in astronomy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, Jews, and Moors; by whom the tables called Alphonfine were composed, at the expense of 40,000, or according to others 400,000 ducats. About the same time Roger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a>, an English monk, published many things relative to astronomy; particularly of the places of the fixed stars, solar rays, and lunar aspects. Vitello, a Polander, wrote a treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">Optics</a> about 1270, in which he showed the use of refractions in astronomy.\n\nFrom this time to that of Purbach, who was born in 1423, few or no improvements were made in astronomy. He wrote a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMENTARY\">commentary</a> on Ptolemy's Almagest, some treatises on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">Arithmetic</a> and Dialling, with tables for various climates. He not only used spheres and globes, but constructed them himself; and formed new tables of the fixed stars, reduced to the middle of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. He composed also new tables of sines for every ten minutes, which Regiomontanus afterwards extended to every single minute, making the whole fine 60, with 6 ciphers annexed. He likewise corrected the tables of the planets, making new equations to them, because the Alphonfine tables were very faulty in this respect. In his solar tables he placed the sun's apogee in the beginning of Cancer; but retained the obliquity of the ecliptic $23^\\circ 33' 5''$, to which it had been reduced by the latest observations. He made new tables for computing eclipses, of which he observed some, and had just published a theory of the planets, when he died in 1461.\n\nJohn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULLER\">Muller</a> of Monterejo (Koningberg), a town of Franconia, from whence he was called Regiomontanus,\nHistory, nus, was the scholar and successor of Purbach. He completed the epitome of Ptolemy's Almagest which Purbach had begun; and after the death of the latter, went to Rome, where he made many astronomical observations. Having returned to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUREMBERG\">Nuremberg</a> in 1471, he was entertained by a wealthy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITIZEN\">citizen</a> named Bernard Walther, who having a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> for astronomy, caused several instruments to be made under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of Regiomontanus, for observing the altitude of the sun and stars, and other celestial phenomena. Among these was an armillary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTROLABE\">astrolabe</a>, like that which had been used by Hipparchus and Ptolemy at Alexandria, and with which many observations were made. He also made ephemerides for 30 years to come, showing the lunations, eclipses, &c. He wrote the Theory of the Planets and Comets, and a Treatise of Triangles yet in repute for several extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>. He is said to have been the first who introduced the use of tangents into trigonometry; and to have published in print (the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> having been lately invented) the works of many of the most celebrated ancient astronomers. After his death, which happened at Rome, Walther made a diligent search for all his instruments and papers which could be found; and continued his observations with the instruments he had till his death. The observations of both were collected by order of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> of Nuremberg, and published there by John Schoner in 1544; afterwards by Snellius at the end of the Observations made by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LANDGRAVE\">Landgrave</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HESSE\">Hesse</a> in 1618; and lastly, in 1666, with those of Tycho Brahe. Walther, however, as we are told by Snellius, found fault with his armilla, not being able to give any observation with certainty to less than ten minutes. He made use of a good clock, which also was a late invention in those days.\n\nJohn Werner, a clergyman, succeeded Walther as astronomer at Nuremberg; having applied himself with great assiduity to the study of that science from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a>. He observed the motion of the comet in 1500; and published several tracts, in which he handled many capital points of geometry, astronomy, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a>, in a masterly manner. He published a translation of Ptolemy's Geography, with a commentary, which is still extant. In this he first proposed the method of finding the longitude at sea by observing the moon's distance from the fixed stars; which is now so successfully put in practice. He also published many other treatises on mathematics and geography; but the most remarkable of all his treatises, are those concerning the motion of the eighth sphere or of the fixed stars, and a short theory of the same. In this he showed, by comparing his own observations of the stars Regulus, Spica Virginis, and the bright star in the southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">Balance</a>, made in 1514, with the places assigned to the same stars by Ptolemy, Alphonius, and others, that the motion of the fixed stars, now called the precession of the equinoctial points, is one degree ten minutes in 100 years, and not one degree only, as former astronomers had made it. He made the obliquity of the ecliptic 23\u00b0 28', and the first star of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARIES\">Aries</a> 26\u00b0 distant from the equinoctial point. He also constructed a planetarium representing the celestial motions according to the Ptolemaic hypothesis, and made a great number of meteorological observations with a view towards the prediction of the weather. The obliquity of the ecliptic was settled by Dominic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARIA\">Maria</a>, the friend of Copernicus, at 23\u00b0 29', which is still held to be just.\n\nThe celebrated Nicholas Copernicus next makes his appearance, and is undoubtedly the greatest reformer of astronomical science. He was originally bred to the trade of medicine, and had obtained the degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>; but having conceived a great regard for the mathematical sciences, especially astronomy, he travelled into Italy, where he for some time was taught by Dominic Maria, or rather assisted him in his astronomical operations. On his return to his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, being made one of the canons of the church, he applied himself with the utmost assiduity to the contemplation of the heavens, and to the study of the celestial motions. He soon perceived the deficiency of all the hypotheses by which it had been attempted to account for these motions; and for this reason he set himself to study the works of the ancients, with all of whom he also was dissatisfied excepting Pythagoras; who, as has been already related, placed the sun in the centre, and supposed all the planets, with the earth itself, to revolve round him. He informs us, that he began to entertain these notions about the year 1507; but not being satisfied with stating the general nature of his hypothesis, he became desirous of determining the several periodical revolutions of the planets, and thence of constructing tables of their motions which might be more agreeable to truth than those of Ptolemy and Alphonius. The observations he was enabled to make, however, must have been extremely inaccurate; as he tells us, that if with the instruments he made use of he should be able to come within ten minutes of the truth, he would rejoice no less than Pythagoras did when he discovered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of the hypotenuse to the other two sides of a right-angled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a>. His work was completed in the year 1530; but he could not be prevailed upon to publish it till towards the end of his life, partly through diffidence, and partly through fear of the offence which might be taken at the singularity of the doctrines set forth in it. At last, overcome by the importunities of his friends, he suffered it to be published at their expense, and under the inspection of Schoner and Osiander, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEDICATION\">dedication</a> to Pope Paul III. and a preface, in which it was attempted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALLIATE\">palliate</a> as much as possible the extraordinary innovations it contained. During the time of its publication, the author himself was attacked by a bloody <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a>, succeeded by a palsy; so that he received a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> only a few hours before his death, which happened on the 23rd of May 1543.\n\nAfter the death of Copernicus, the astronomical science was greatly improved by Schoner, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NONIUS\">Nonius</a>, Apian, and Gemma Frisius. Schoner survived Copernicus only four years; however, he greatly improved the methods of making celestial observations, reformed and explained the calendar, and published a treatise of cosmography. Nonius had applied himself very early to the study of astronomy and navigation; but finding the instruments at that time in use excessively inaccurate, he applied himself to the invention of others which should be less liable to inconvenience. Thus he invented the astronomical quadrant, in which he divided the degrees into minutes by a number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCENTRIC\">concentric</a> circles.\ncircles. The first of these was divided into 90 equal parts, the second into 89, the third into 88, and so on, as low as 46; and thus, as the index of the quadrant would always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> upon one or other of the divisions, or very near it, the minutes might be known by computation. He published many treatises on mathematical subjects, particularly one which detected the errors of Orontius, who had imagined that he could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> the circle, double the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a>, &c., by finding two mean proportionals between two right lines.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPIAN\">Appian</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> work was entitled *The Caesarean Astronomy*; and was published at Ingolstadt in 1540, dedicated to the emperor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Ferdinand. In this he showed how to resolve astronomical problems by means of instruments, without either calculations or tables; to observe the places of the stars and planets by the astrolabe; and to foretell eclipses and describe the figures of them: the whole illustrated by proper diagrams. In his second book he describes the method of dividing an astronomical quadrant, and of using it properly. His treatise concludes with the observation of five comets. Gemma Frisius wrote a commentary on a work of Appian entitled his *Cosmography*, with many observations of eclipses. He invented also the astronomical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a>, and several other instruments, which, though they could not boast of much exactness superior to others, were yet of considerable utility in taking observations at sea; and he is also memorable for being the first who proposed a time-keeper for determining the longitude at sea.\n\nGeorge Joachim Rheticus was a scholar of Copernicus, to attend whose lectures he gave up his professorship of mathematics at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITTENBERG\">Wittenberg</a>. For the improvement of astronomical calculations, he began to construct a table of sines, tangents, and secants, for every minute and ten seconds of the quadrant. In this work he first showed the use of secants in trigonometry, and greatly enlarged the use of tangents, first invented by Regiomontanus; but he assigned for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADIUS\">radius</a> a much larger number of places than had been done before, for the greater exactness of calculation. This great work he did not live to accomplish; but it was completed by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> Valentine Otho, and published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEIDELBERG\">Heidelberg</a> in 1594.\n\nDuring this century, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of astronomers was dignified by some very illustrious names. About the year 1561, William IV., landgrave of Hesse Cassel, applied himself to the study of astronomy. With the assistance of Rothman and Burgius, the former an astronomer, the latter an excellent mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> maker, he erected an observatory on the top of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> at Cassel, and furnished it with such instruments as were then in use, made in the best manner the artists of that age could execute. With these he made a great number of observations, which were by Hevelius preferred to those of Tycho Brahe, and which were published by Snellius in 1618. From these observations he determined the longitudes and latitudes of 400 stars, which he inserted in a catalogue where their places are rectified to the beginning of the year 1593.\n\nTycho Brahe began his observations about the same time with the landgrave of Hesse, already mentioned. He observed the great conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in 1563; and finding the instruments he could procure very inaccurate, he made a quadrant capable of showing single minutes, and likewise a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEXTANT\">sextant</a> four cubits radius. In 1571, he discovered a new star in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol5.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CASSIOPEIA\">Cassiopeia</a>; which induced him, like Hipparchus, to make a catalogue of the stars. This contained the places of 777 stars, rectified to the year 1600; but instead of the moon, which was used by the ancients to connect the places of the sun and stars, Tycho substituted Venus, as having little or no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLAX\">parallax</a>, and yet being like the moon visible both day and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>. By the recommendation of the landgrave of Hesse, he obtained from the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Hvenna, opposite to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPENHAGEN\">Copenhagen</a>, where an observatory was built. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> of this building, afterwards called Uraniborg, was laid in the year 1576. It was Account of a square form, one side of it being about 60 feet in Uraniborg, length; and on the east and west sides were two round its observatory towers of 32 feet diameter each. The instruments were larger and more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> than had ever been seen before by any astronomer. They consisted of quadrants, sextants, circles, semicircles, armilles both equatorial and zodiacal, parallactic rulers, rings, astrolabes, globes, clocks, and sun-dials. These instruments were so divided as to show single minutes; and in some the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> might be read off to 10 seconds. Most of the divisions were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DIAGONAL\">diagonal</a>: but he had one quadrant divided according to the method invented by Nonius; that is, by 47 concentric circles. The whole expense is said to have amounted to 200,000 crowns. The method of dividing by diagonals, which Tycho greatly admired, was the invention of Mr Richard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">Chancellor</a>, an Englishman: Tycho, however, shows, that it is not accurately true when straight lines are employed, and the circles at equal distances from each other; but that it may be corrected by making circular diagonals, which if continued would pass through the centre.\n\nTycho employed his time at Uraniborg to the best advantage; but falling into disrepute on the death of the king, he was obliged to remove to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLSTEIN\">Holstein</a>, and at last found means to get himself introduced to the emperor, with whom he continued to his death. He is well known to have been the inventor of a system of astronomy, which bears his name; and which he vainly endeavoured to establish on the ruins of that of Copernicus: but the simplicity and evident <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> to the phenomena of nature, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in all parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-COPERNICAN_SYSTEM\">Copernican system</a>, soon got the better of the unnatural and complicated system of Tycho. His works, however, which are very numerous, discover him to have been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of vast abilities. After his death the castle of Uraniborg quickly fell to decay, and indeed seems to have been purposely pulled down; for, in 1652, when Mr Huet went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>, it was almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, and few traces of the walls could be discerned. None of the neighbouring inhabitants had ever heard of the name of Tycho or Uraniborg, excepting one old man, whom Mr Huet found out with great difficulty, and who had been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>! All the discoveries of Purback, Regiomontanus, and Tycho, were collected and published in the year 1621, by Dongomontanus, who had been Tycho's favourite scholar.\n\nWhile Tycho resided at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRAGUE\">Prague</a> with the emperor, discoveries invited thither John Kepler, afterwards so famous of Kepler's for his discoveries. Under the tuition of so great an astronomer, the latter quickly made an amazing progress.\nHe found that his predecessors had erred in supposing the orbits of the planets to be circular, and their motions uniform; on the contrary, he perceived, from his own observations, that they were elliptical, and their motions unequal, having the sun in one of the foci of their orbits; but that, however, they varied in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a>, a line drawn from the centre of the sun to the planet, and revolving with it, would always describe equal areas in equal times. He discovered, in the year 1618, that the squares of the periodical times are as the cubes of the distances of the planets; two laws which have been of the greatest importance to the advancement of astronomy. He seems to have had some notion of the extensive power of the principle of gravity: for he tells us, that gravity is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> power betwixt two bodies; that the moon and earth tend towards each other, and would meet in a point nearer the earth than the moon in the proportion of the superior magnitude of the former, were they not hindered by their projectile motions. He adds also, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> arise from the gravitation of the waters towards the moon: however, he did not adhere steadily to these principles, but afterwards substituted others as the causes of the planetary motions.\n\nContemporary with Kepler were Mr Edward Wright, and Napier, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARON\">baron</a> of Merchiston. To the former we owe several very good meridional observations of the sun's altitude, made with a quadrant of six feet radius, in the years 1594, 1595, and 1596; from which he greatly improved the theory of the sun's motion, and computed more exact tables of his declination than had been done by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> before. He published also, in 1599, an excellent treatise, entitled, \"Certain Errors in Navigation discovered and detected.\" To the latter we are indebted for the knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">logarithms</a>; a discovery, as was justly observed by Dr Halley, one of the most useful ever made in the art of numbering. John Bayer, a German, who lived about the same time, will ever be memorable for his work, entitled, Uranometria, which is a very complete celestial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATLAS\">atlas</a>, or a collection of all the constellations visible in Europe. To this he added a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOMENCLATURE\">nomenclature</a>, in which the stars in each constellation are marked with the letters of the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a>; and thus every star in the heavens may be referred to with the utmost precision and exactness. About the same time also, astronomy was cultivated by many other persons abroad, by Maginus, Mercator, Maurusius, Homelinus, Schultet, Stevin, &c.; and by Thomas and Leonard Digges, John <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEE\">Dee</a>, and Robert Flood, in England: but none of them made any considerable improvement.\n\nThe beginning of the 17th century was distinguished not only by the discovery of logarithms, but by that of telescopes; a sort of instruments, by which astronomy was brought to a degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> utterly inconceivable by those who knew nothing of them. The question concerning the inventor is discussed under the article Optics; but whoever was entitled to this merit, it is certain that Galileo was the first who brought them to such perfection as to make any considerable discoveries in the celestial regions. With instruments of his own making, Galileo discovered the inequalities in the moon's surface, the satellites of Jupiter, and the ring of Saturn; though this last was unknown to him after he had seen it, and the view he got made him conclude that the planet had a threefold body, or that it was of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> shape like an olive. He discovered spots on the sun, by means of which he found out the revolution of that luminary on his axis; and he discovered also that the milky way and nebulae were full of small stars. It was not, however, till some time after these discoveries were made, that Galileo and others thought of applying the observations on Jupiter's satellites to the purpose of finding the longitude of places on the surface of the earth; and even after this was thought of, astronomers found it so difficult to construct tables of their motions, that it was not till after many observations had been made in distant places of the world, that Cassini was able to determine what positions of the satellites were most proper for finding out the longitude. At last he perceived that the entrance of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATELLITE\">satellite</a> into the shadow of Jupiter, and the exit of it from the same, were the most proper for this purpose: that next to these conjunctions of the satellites with Jupiter, or with one another, may be made use of; especially when any two of them, moving in contrary directions, meet with each other: and lastly, that observations on the shadows of the satellites, which may be seen on the disk of Jupiter, are useful, as also the spots which are seen upon his face, and are carried along with greater velocity than has hitherto been discovered in any of the other heavenly bodies.\n\nWhile astronomers were thus busy in making new logarithmic discoveries, the mathematicians in different countries made tables of logarithms employed in constructing logarithmic tables to facilitate their calculations. Benjamin Ursinus, an excellent mathematician of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRANDENBURG\">Brandenburg</a>, calculated much larger tables of logarithms than had been done by their noble inventor, and published them in 1625. They were improved by Henry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRIGGS\">Briggs</a>, Savilian professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>; who by making unity the logarithm of ten, thus rendered them much more convenient for the purposes of calculation. Logarithmic tables of sines and tangents were also composed by Mr Briggs and Adrian Vlacq at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOUDA\">Gouda</a>, so that the burdens of calculation was now rendered nearly as easy as possible.\n\nIn 1633, Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORROX\">Horrox</a>, a young astronomer of very extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a>, discovered that Venus would pass Venus' orbit over the disk of the sun on the 24th of November, 1639. This event he announced only to one friend, Mr Crabtree; and these two were the only persons in the world who observed this transit the first time it had ever been viewed by human eyes. Mr Horrox made many useful observations at the time; and had even formed a new theory of the moon, so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> as to attract the notice of Sir Isaac Newton; but the hopes of astronomers from the abilities of this excellent young man were blasted by his death in the beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1640.\n\nAbout the year 1638 many learned men began to assemble at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> in order to hold conferences on different scientific subjects, which was the first foundation of the Royal Academy of Sciences in that capital. This practice was introduced in France by Merenius, Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>, and soon after at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> by Oldenburg; which laid the foundation of the Royal Society there. About this time also the celebrated astronomer Hevelius flourished at Danzig, building an observatory in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>.\nhouse, and furnishing it with excellent instruments of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>; particularly octants and sextants of brass of three and four feet radius, as well as telescopes, with which he constantly observed the spots and phases of the moon, and from which observations he afterwards compiled his excellent and beautiful work entitled *Selenographia*. This noble building, together with all the books and instruments it contained, was consumed by fire on the 26th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> 1679; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, as well as the form and construction of the instruments, is preserved in a curious work of the ingenious inventor, entitled *Marina Celestis*; though almost the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of this book was involved in the same fate with the instruments it describes. The damage sustained on this occasion was estimated at 30,000 crowns.\n\nThe celebrated English mechanic Dr Hooke, who was contemporary with Hevelius, had in the meantime invented instruments with telecopic sights, which he preferred to those used by Hevelius so much, that a dispute commenced, which procured Hevelius a visit from Dr Halley. The latter had at that time taken a voyage to St Helena, at the desire of the Royal Society, in order to observe and form a catalogue of the stars in the southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEMISPHERE\">hemisphere</a>. The result of his observations with Hevelius's instruments was, that three several observations on the Spica Virginis and Regulus differed only a few seconds from each other. They were the invention of Tycho Brahe, and are described under the article Optics. At this visit Halley and Hevelius observed an occultation of Jupiter by the moon, and determined the diameter of the latter to be $30', 33''$.\n\nIn 1671 the royal observatory in Paris was finished, and the use of it assigned to Mr Caffini, after it had been furnished with instruments at a very great expense; and the observatory at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a> being likewise built five years after, Mr Flamstead was appointed astronomer-royal. The observations in both these places, however, have been so numerous, that it is in vain to attempt any account of them.\n\nBefore the middle of the 17th century the construction of telescopes had been greatly improved, particularly by Fontana and Huygens. The latter constructed one of 123 feet, which is still preserved in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">museum</a> of the Royal Society at London. With this he observed the moon and planets for a long time, and discovered that Saturn was encompassed with a ring. The French, however, still outdid the English artists; and by means of telescopes of 200 and 300 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a>, Mr Caffini was enabled to see all the five satellites of Saturn, his belts, and the shadows of Jupiter's satellites passing over his body. In 1666 Mr Auzout applied a micrometer to telescopes for the purpose of measuring the diameters of the planets, and small distances in the heavens; however, an instrument of this kind had been before invented by Mr Galcogne, though it was but little known abroad.","sp":12,"ep":23},{"h":"ASTRONOMY","t":"The observations are sufficient to prove, that the sun has an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a>, and extending to a great height. Like our atmosphere, it is obliquely subject to agitations, similar to our winds; and it is also transparent. The following is Dr Herschel's theoretical explanation of the solar phenomena.\n\n\"We have admitted,\" says he, \"that a transparent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAS\">gas</a> comes up through the openings, by forcing itself a passage through the planetary clouds. Our observations seemed naturally to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to this supposition, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> rather to prove it; for, in tracing the shallows to their origin, it has been shewn, that they always begin from the openings, and go forwards. We have also seen, that in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIAS\">bias</a> given to incipient shallows, lengthened a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of them out in one certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, which evidently denoted a propelling force acting the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> in them all. I am, however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> prepared to distinguish between facts observed, and the consequences that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> upon them we may draw from them; and it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be easy to separate them, if that should hereafter be required.\n\n\"If, however, it be now allowed, that the cause we have assigned may be the true one, it will then appear, that the operations which are carried <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> in the atmosphere of the sun are very simple and uniform.\n\n\"By the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of the sun, an elastic gas, which may be called empyreal, is constantly formed. This ascends everywhere, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> gravity less than that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> solar atmospheric gas contained in the lower regions. When it goes up in moderate quantities, it makes itself small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> among the lower regions of clouds: these we have frequently observed, and have called them pores. We have shewn that they are liable to continual and quick changes, which must be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of their fleeting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>.\n\n\"When this empyreal gas has reached the higher regions of the sun's atmosphere, it mixes with other gases, which, from their specific gravity, have their residence there, and occasions decompositions which produce the appearance of corrugations. It has been shewn, that the elevated parts of the corrugations are small self-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> nodules, or broken ridges; and I have used the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of self-luminous clouds, as a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> for all phenomena of the sun, in what shapesoever they may appear, that shine by their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>. These terms do not exactly convey the idea affixed to them; but those of meteors, coruscations, inflammations, luminous wisps, or others, which I might have selected, would have been liable to fill greater objections. It is true, that when speaking of clouds, we generally conceive something too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a>, and even too permanent, to permit us to apply that expression properly to luminous decompositions, which cannot float or swim in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, as we are used to see our planetary clouds do. But it should be remembered, that, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the great compression arising from the force of the gravity, all the elastic solar gases must be much condensed; and that, consequently, phenomena in the sun's atmosphere, which in ours would be mere transitory coruscations, such as those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AURORA_BOREALIS\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA\">aurora</a> borealis, will be so compressed as to become much more efficacious and permanent.\n\n\"The great light occasioned by the brilliant superior regions, must scatter itself on the tops of the inferior planetary clouds, and, on account of their great density, bring on a very vivid reflection. Between the interstices of the elevated parts of the corrugations, or self-luminous clouds, which, according to the observations that have been given, are not closely connected, the light reflected from the lower clouds will be plainly visible, and, being considerably less intense than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> illumination from the upper regions, will occasion that faint appearance which we have called indentations.\n\n\"This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of the light reflected from the indentations, and that which is emitted directly from the higher parts of the corrugations, unless very attentively examined by a superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a>, will only have the resemblance of a mottled surface.\n\n\"When a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of empyreal gas, more than what produces only pores in ascending, is formed, it will make itself small openings; or, meeting perhaps with some resistance in pushing upwards, it may exert its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> in the production of ridges and nodules.\n\n\"Lastly, If still further an uncommon quantity of this gas should be formed, it will burst through the planetary regions of clouds, and thus will produce great openings; then, spreading itself above them, it will occasion <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> shallows, and, mixing afterwards gradually with other superior gases, it will promote the increase, and assist in the maintenance, of the general luminous phenomena.\n\n\"If this account of the solar appearances should be well founded, we shall have no difficulty in ascertaining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> state of the sun, with regard to its energy in giving light and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> to our globe; and nothing will now remain, but to decide the question which will naturally occur, whether there be actually any considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in the quantity of light and heat emitted from the sun at different times. This question he decides in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFIRMATIVE\">affirmative</a>, considering the great number of spots as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that the sun is emitting a great quantity of light and heat, and the want of spots as the contrary. The first is connected with a warm and good season; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, on the contrary, produces a bad one.\"\n\nCHAP. II. Of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOON\">Moon</a>.\n\nNext to the sun, the most conspicuous of all the heavenly bodies is the moon. The changes which it undergoes are more striking and more frequent than those of the sun, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> motions much more rapid. Hence they were attended to even before those of the sun were known; a fact which explains why the first inhabitants of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> reckoned their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> by the moon's motions, and of course followed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> instead of the solar year. In considering the moon, we shall follow the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> that we observed with respect to the sun. We shall first give an account of her apparent motions; and, secondly, of her nature as far as it has been ascertained. These topics shall occupy the two following sections.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>.\nSect. I. Of the Apparent Motions of the Moon.\n\nThe moon, like the sun, has a peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> to west. If we observe her any evening when she is situated very near any fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a>, we shall find her, in 24 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, about $1^\\circ$ to the east of that star, and her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> continually increases, till at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a>, after a certain number of days, she returns again to the same star from the west, having performed a complete revolution in the heavens. By a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of observations it has been ascertained, that the moon makes a complete revolution in $27,32166118036$ days, or $27$ days $7$ hours $43'11''31''35'''$. Such at least was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of its revolution at the commencement of 1700. But it does not remain always the same. From a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> between the observations of the ancients with those of the moderns, it appears, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> motion of the moon in her orbit is accelerating. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a>, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> sensible at present, will gradually become more and more obvious. It is a point of great importance to discover, whether it will always continue to increase, or whether, after arriving at a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAXIMUM\">maximum</a>, it will again diminish. Observations could be of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> for many ages in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of this question; but the Newtonian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> has enabled astronomers to ascertain that the acceleration is periodical.\n\nThe moon's motion in her orbit is still more unequal than that of the sun. In one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of her orbit she moves faster, in another slower. By knowing the time of a complete revolution, we can easily calculate the mean motion for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, or any given time; and this mean motion is called the mean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANOMALY\">anomaly</a>. The true motion is called the true anomaly: the difference between the two is called the equation. Now the moon's equation sometimes amounts to $6^\\circ18'32''$.\n\nHer apparent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> varies with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> of her angular motion. When she moves fastest, her diameter is largest; it is smallest when her angular motion is slowest. When smallest, the apparent diameter is $0.489420^\\circ$; when biggest, it is $0.558030^\\circ$. Hence it follows, that the distance of the moon from the earth varies. By following the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of reasoning, which we have detailed in the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a>, Kepler ascertained that the orbit of the moon is an ellipse, having the earth in one of its foci. Her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADIUS\">radius</a> vector describes equal areas in equal times; and her angular motion is inversely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of her distance from the earth.\n\nThe eccentricity of the elliptic orbit of the moon, has been ascertained to amount to $0.0553068$, (the mean distance of the earth being represented by unity); or the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a> is to the smaller, nearly as $100,000$ to $99,848$.\n\nThat point of the moon's orbit which is nearest the earth, is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIGEE\">perigee</a>; the opposite point is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOGEE\">apogee</a>. The line which joins these opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, is called the line of the moon's apsides. It moves slowly eastward, completing a sidereal revolution in $3232.46643$ days, or nearly $9$ years.\n\nThe inclination of the moon's orbit is also variable: the greatest inequality is proportional to the cosine of twice the sun's angular distance from the ascending node, and amounts when a maximum to $0.14679^\\circ$.\n\nEven the elliptical orbit of the moon represents but imperfectly her real motion round the earth; for that luminary is subjected to a great number of irregularities, evidently connected with the positions of the sun, which considerably alter the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of her orbit. The three following are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> of these.\n\n1. The greatest of all, and the one which was first ascertained, is called by astronomers the moon's equation. It is proportional to the sine of twice the mean angular distance of the moon from the sun, minus the mean angular distance of the moon from the perigee of its orbit. Its maximum amounts to $1.3410^\\circ$. In the oppositions and conjunctions of the sun and moon it coincides with the equation of the centre, which it always diminishes. Hence the ancients who determined that equation by means of the eclipses, found that equation smaller than it is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>.\n\n2. There is another inequality in the motion of the moon, which disappears during the conjunctions and oppositions of the sun and moon; and likewise when these bodies are $90^\\circ$ distant from each other. It is at its maximum when their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> distance is about $45^\\circ$, and then amounts to about $0.594^\\circ$. Hence it has been concluded to be proportional to the sine of twice the mean angular distance of the moon from the sun. This inequality is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a>. It disappears during the eclipses.\n\n3. The moon's motion is accelerated when that of the sun is retarded, and the contrary. This occasions an irregularity called the annual equation. It follows exactly the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> with that of the equation of the centre of the sun, only with a contrary sine. At its maximum it amounts to $0.18576^\\circ$. During eclipses, it coincides with the equation of the sun.\n\nThe moon's orbit is inclined to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECLIPTIC\">ecliptic</a> at an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of $5.14692^\\circ$. The points where it intersects the ecliptic are called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NODES\">nodes</a>. Their position is not fixed in the heavens. They have a retrograde motion, that is to say, a motion contrary to that of the sun. This motion may be easily traced by marking the successive stars which the moon passes when it crosses the ecliptic. They make a complete revolution of the Revolution heavens in $6793.3009$ days. The ascending node is that in which the moon rises above the ecliptic towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> pole, the descending node that in which she sinks below the equator towards the south pole. The motion of the nodes is subjected to several irregularities, the greatest of which is proportional to the sine of twice the angular distance of the sun from the ascending node of the lunar orbit. When at a maximum, it amounts to $1.62945^\\circ$. The inclination of the orbit itself is variable. Its greatest inequality amounts to $0.14679^\\circ$. It is proportional to the cosine of the same angle on which the irregularity in the motion of the nodes depends.\n\nThe apparent diameter of the moon varies as well as that of the sun, and in a more remarkable manner. When smallest, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> $29.5'$; when largest, $34'$. This must be owing to the distance of the moon from the earth being subject to variations.\n\nThe great distance of the sun from the earth renders it difficult to determine its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLAX\">parallax</a>, on account of its minuteness. This is not the case with the moon. The distance of that luminary from the earth may be determined without much difficulty.\nLet BAG (fig. 10.) be one half of the earth, AC its semidiameter, S the sun, M the moon, and EKOL a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the circle described by the moon in revolving from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MERIDIAN\">meridian</a> to the meridian again. Let CRS be the rational <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a> of an observer at A, extended to the sun in the heavens; and HAO, his sensible horizon extended to the moon's orbit. ALC is the angle under which the earth's semidiameter AC is seen from the moon at L; which is equal to the angle OAL, because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> lines AO and CL which include both these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a>. ASC is the angle under which the earth's semidiameter AC is seen from the sun at S; and is equal to the angle OAF, because the lines AO and CRS are parallel. Now, it is found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, that the angle OAL is much greater than the angle OAF; but OAL is equal to ALC, and OAF is equal to ASC. Now as ASC is much less than ALC, it proves that the earth's semidiameter AC appears much greater as seen from the moon at L than from the sun at S; and therefore the earth is much farther from the sun than from the moon. The quantities of these angles may be determined by observation in the following manner.\n\nLet a graduated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, as DAE (the larger the better), having a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> index with sight-holes, be fixed in such a manner, that its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> surface may be parallel to the plane of the equator, and its edge <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AD\">AD</a> in the meridian; so that when the moon is in the equinoctial, and on the meridian ADE, she may be seen through the sight-holes when the edge of the moveable index cuts the beginning of the divisions at O, on the graduated limb DE; and when the moon is seen, let the precise time be noted. Now as the moon revolves about the earth from the meridian to the meridian again in about 24 hours 48 minutes, she will go a fourth part round it in a fourth part of that time, viz. in 6 hours 12 minutes as seen from C, that is, from the earth's centre or pole. But as seen from A, the observer's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> on the earth's surface, the moon will seem to have gone a quarter round the earth when she comes to the sensible horizon at O; for the index through the sights of which she is then viewed will be at d, 90 degrees from D, where it was when she was seen at E. Now let the exact moment when the moon is seen at O (which will be when she is in or near the sensible horizon) be carefully noted (c) that it may be known in what time she has gone from E to O; which time subtracted from 6 hours 12 minutes (the time of her going from E to L) leaves the time of her going from O to L, and affords an easy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> for finding the angle OAL (called the moon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> parallax, which is equal to the angle ALC) by the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a>: As the time of the moon's describing the arc EO is to 90 degrees, so is 6 hours 12 minutes to the degrees of the arc D'ED, which measures the angle EAL; from which subtract 90 degrees, and there remains the angle OAL, equal to the angle ALC, under which the earth's semidiameter AC is seen from the moon. Now, since all the angles of a right-lined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> are equal to 180 degrees, or to two right angles, and the sides of a triangle are always proportional to the sines of the opposite angles, say, by the Rule of Three, As the sine of the angle ALC at the moon L, is to its opposite side AC, the earth's semidiameter, which is known to be 3985 miles; so is radius, viz. the sine of 90 degrees, or of the right angle ALC, to its opposite side AL, which is the moon's distance at L from the observer's place at A on the earth's surface; or, so is the sine of the angle CAL to its opposite side CL, which is the moon's distance from the earth's centre, and comes out at a mean rate to be 240,000 miles. The angle CAL is equal to what OAL wants of 90 degrees.\n\nOther methods have been fallen upon for determining the moon's parallax; of which the following is recommended as the best, by Mr Ferguson, though hitherto it has not been put in practice. \"Let two observers be placed under the same meridian, one in the northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEMISPHERE\">hemisphere</a> and the other in the southern, at such a distance from each other, that the arc of the celestial meridian included between their two zeniths may be at least 80 or 90 degrees. Let each observer take the distance of the moon's centre from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZENITH\">zenith</a>, by means of an exceeding good instrument, at the moment of her passing the meridian; and these two zenith distances of the moon together, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> above the distance between the two zeniths, will be the distance between the two apparent places of the moon. Then, as the sum of the natural sines of the two zenith distances of the moon is to radius, so is the distance between her two apparent places to her horizontal parallax: which being found, her distance from the earth's centre may be found by the analogy mentioned above.\n\nThus, in fig. 11, let VECQ be the earth, M the moon, and Zbza an arc of the celestial meridian. Let V be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a> EV is 48\u00b0 20' north; and C the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">Hope</a>, whose latitude EC is 34\u00b0 30' south: both which latitudes we suppose to be accurately determined beforehand by the observers. As these two places are on the same meridian nVECq, and in different hemispheres, the sum of their latitudes 82\u00b0 50' is their distance from each other. Z is the zenith of Vienna, and z the zenith of the Cape of Good Hope; which two zeniths are also 82\u00b0 50' distant from each other, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> celestial meridian Zz. To the observer at Vienna, the moon's centre will appear at a in the celestial meridian; and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a>, to the observer at the Cape, it will appear at b. Now suppose the moon's distance Za from the zenith of Vienna to be 38\u00b0 1' 53\", and her distance zb from the zenith of the Cape of Good Hope to be 46\u00b0 4' 41\": the sum of these two zenith distances (Za + zb) is 84\u00b0 6' 34\"; from which subtract 82\u00b0 50', the distance of Zz between the zeniths of these two places, and there will remain 1\u00b0 16' 34\" for the arc ba, or distance between the two apparent places of the moon's centre, as seen from V and from C. Then,\n\n(c) Here proper allowance must be made for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFRACTION\">refraction</a>, which being about 34 minutes of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> in the horizon, will cause the moon's centre to appear 34 minutes above the horizon when her centre is really in it.\nApparent supposing the tabular radius to be 10,000,000, the natural fine of 38\u00b0 1' 53\" (the arc Za) is 6,160,816, and the natural fine of 40\u00b0 4' 41\" (the arc Zb) is 7,202,821; the sum of both these fines is 13,363,637. Say therefore, As 13,363,637 is to 10,000,000, so is 1\u00b0 16' 34\" to 57\u00b0 18\", which is the moon's horizontal parallax.\n\nIf the two places of observation be not exactly under the same meridian, their difference of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> must be accurately taken, that proper allowance may be made for the moon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECLINATION\">declination</a> whilst she is passing from the meridian of the one to the meridian of the other.\n\nFrom the theory of the parallax we know, that at the distance of the moon from the earth the apparent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of the earth would be to that of the moon as 21,352 to 5823. Their respective diameters must be proportional to these numbers, or almost as 11 to 3. Hence the bulk of the moon is 49 times less than that of the earth.\n\nThe different appearances, or phases, of the moon constitute some of the most striking phenomena of the heavens. When she emerges from the rays of the sun in an evening, she appears after sunset as a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRESCENT\">crescent</a> just visible. The size of this crescent increases continually as she separates to a greater distance from the sun, and when she is exactly in opposition to that luminary, she appears under the form of a complete circle. This circle changes into a crescent as she approaches nearer that luminary, exactly in the same manner it had increased, till at last she disappears altogether, plunging into the sun's rays in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> at sunrise. The crescent of the moon being always directed towards the sun, indicates obviously that she borrows her light from that luminary; while the law of the variation of her phases, almost proportional to the versed sine of the angular distance of the moon from the sun, demonstrates that her figure is spherical. Hence it follows, that the moon is an opaque spherical body.\n\nThese different phases of the moon are renewed after every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a>. They depend upon the excess of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYNODICAL\">synodical</a> movement of the moon above that of the sun, an excess which is usually termed the synodical motion of the moon. The duration of the synodical revolution of the moon in the mean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> between two conjunctions is 29.530588 days. It is to the tropical year nearly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of 19 to 235, that is to say, that 19 solar years consist of about 235 lunar months.\n\nThe points of the lunar orbit, in which the moon is either in conjunction or opposition to the sun are called syzygies. In the first point the moon is said to be new, in the second to be full. The quadratures are those points in which the moon is distant from the sun 90\u00b0 or 270\u00b0. When in these points the moon is said to be in her first and third quarter. One half only of the moon is then illuminated or seen from the earth. As a more particular account of these phases may be deemed necessary, we subjoin the following explanation, which will perhaps be better understood by the generality of readers.\n\nThe moon is an opaque globe like the earth, and shines only by reflecting the light of the sun; therefore, whilst that half of her which is towards the sun is enlightened, the other half must be dark and invisible. Hence she disappears when she comes between us and the sun; because her dark side is then towards us. When she is gone a little way forward, we see a little of her enlightened side; which still increases to our view as she advances forward, until she comes to be opposite to the sun; and then her whole enlightened side is towards the earth, and she appears with a round illuminated orb, which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> the full moon; her dark side being then turned away from the earth. From the full she seems to decrease gradually as she goes through the other half of her course; showing us less and less of her enlightened side every day, till her next change or conjunction with the sun, and then she disappears as before.\n\nThe moon has scarcely any difference of seasons; her axis being almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to the ecliptic. What is very singular, one half of her has no darkness at all; the earth constantly affording it a strong light in the sun's absence; while the other half has a fortnight's darkness and a fortnight's light by turns.\n\nOur earth is thought to be a moon to the moon; Earth waxing and waning regularly, but appearing 13 times as big, and affording her 13 times as much light as she does us. When she changes to us the earth appears full to her; and when she is in her first quarter to us, the earth is in its third quarter to her; and vice versa.\n\nBut from one half of the moon the earth is never seen at all; from the middle of the other half, it is always seen over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> round almost 30 times as quick as the moon does. From the circle which limits our view of the moon, only one half of the earth's side next her is seen; the other half being hid below the horizon of all places on that circle. To her the earth seems to be the biggest body in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>; for it appears 13 times as big as she does to us.\n\nAs the earth turns round its axis, the several continents, seas, and islands, appear to the moon's inhabitants like so many spots of different forms and brightness, moving over its surface; but much fainter at some times than others, as our clouds cover them or leave them. By these spots the lunarians can determine the time of the earth's diurnal motion, just as we do the motion of the sun; and perhaps they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> their time by the motion of the earth's spots; for they cannot have a truer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DIAL\">dial</a>.\n\nThe moon's axis is so nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic, that the sun never removes sensibly from her lunar equator; and the obliquity of her orbit, which is next nothing as seen from the sun, cannot cause the sun to decline sensibly from her equator. Yet her inhabitants are not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFINITE\">definite</a> means for ascertaining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of their year, though their method and ours must differ. For we can know the length of our year by the return of our equinoxes; but the lunarians, having always equal day and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, must have recourse to another method; and we may suppose, they measure their year by observing when either of the poles of our earth begins to be enlightened, and the other to disappear, which is always at our equinoxes; they being conveniently situated for observing great tracts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a> about our earth's poles which are entirely unknown to us. Hence we may conclude, that the year is of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> length both to the earth and moon, though very\nApparent Motions of natural days, and the lunarians only \\(12\\frac{1}{3}\\) every day and night in the moon being as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as \\(29\\frac{1}{3}\\) on the earth.\n\nThe moon's inhabitants on the side next the earth may as easily find the longitude of their places as we can find the latitude of ours. For the earth keeping constantly, or very nearly so, over one meridian of the moon, the east or west distances of places from that meridian are as easily found as we can find our distance from the equator by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> of our celestial poles.\n\nAs the sun can only enlighten that half of the earth which is at any moment turned towards him, and, being withdrawn from the opposite half, leaves it in darkness, so he likewise doth to the moon; only with this difference, that as the earth is surrounded by an atmosphere, we have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TWILIGHT\">twilight</a> after the sun sets; but if the moon has none of her own, nor is included in that of the earth, the lunar inhabitants have an immediate transition from the brightest sunshine to the blackest darkness. For, let \\(r\\) \\(t\\) \\(k\\) \\(s\\) \\(w\\) be the earth, and \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\), \\(E\\), \\(F\\), \\(G\\), \\(H\\), the moon in eight different parts of her orbit. As the earth turns round its axis from west to east, when any place comes to \\(t\\), the twilight begins there, and when it revolves from thence to \\(r\\) the sun rises; when the place comes to \\(s\\) the sun sets, and when it comes to \\(w\\) the twilight ends. But as the moon turns round her axis, which is only once a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, the moment that any part of her surface comes to \\(r\\) (see the moon at \\(G\\)), the sun rises there without any previous warning by twilight; and when the same point comes to \\(s\\) the sun sets, and that point goes into darkness as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> as at midnight.\n\nThe moon being an opaque spherical body (for her hills take off no more from her roundness than the inequalities on the surface of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a> take off from its roundness), we can only see that part of the enlightened half of her which is towards the earth. And therefore, when the moon is at \\(A\\), in conjunction with the sun \\(S\\), her dark half is towards the earth, and she disappears, as at \\(a\\), there being no light on that half to render it visible. When she comes to her first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OCTANT\">octant</a> at \\(B\\), or has gone an eighth part of her orbit from her conjunction, a quarter of her enlightened side is towards the earth, and she appears horned, as at \\(b\\). When she has gone a quarter of her orbit from between the earth and sun to \\(C\\), she shows us one half of her enlightened side, as at \\(c\\), and we say, she is a quarter old. At \\(D\\), she is in her second octant; and by showing us more of her enlightened side she appears gibbous, as at \\(d\\). At \\(E\\), her whole enlightened side is towards the earth; and therefore she appears round, as at \\(e\\); when we say it is full moon. In her third octant at \\(F\\), part of her dark side being towards the earth, she again appears gibbous, and is on the decrease, as at \\(f\\). At \\(G\\), we see just one half of her enlightened side; and she appears half decreased, or in her third quarter, as at \\(g\\). At \\(H\\), we only see a quarter of her enlightened side, being in her fourth octant; where she appears horned, as at \\(b\\). And at \\(A\\), having completed her course from the sun to the sun again, she disappears; and we say it is new moon. Thus, in going from \\(A\\) to \\(E\\), the moon seems continually to increase; and in going from \\(E\\) to \\(A\\), to decrease in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a>; having like phases at equal distances from \\(A\\) to \\(E\\), but as seen from the sun the heavenly bodies are always full.\n\nThe moon appears not perfectly round when she is full in the highest or lowest part of her orbit, because we have not a full view of her enlightened side at that time. When full in the highest part of her orbit, a small deficiency appears on her lower edge; and the contrary when full in the lowest part of her orbit.\n\nIt is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> by the figure, that when the moon changes to the earth, the earth appears full to the moon; and vice versa. For when the moon is at \\(A\\), new to the earth, the whole enlightened side of the earth is towards the moon; and when the moon is at \\(E\\), full to the earth, its dark side is towards her. Hence a new moon answers to a full earth, and a full moon to a new earth. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> are also reversed to each other.\n\nBetween the third quarter and change, the moon is agreeable frequently visible in the forenoon, even when the sun represents himself; and then she affords us an opportunity of seeing a very agreeable appearance, wherever we find a globular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the eye, as suppose on the top of a gate. For, if the sun shines on the stone, and we place ourselves so as the upper part of the stone may just seem to touch the point of the moon's lowermost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>, we shall then see the enlightened part of the stone exactly of the same shape with the moon; horned as she is, and inclined the same way to the horizon. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> is plain; for the sun enlightens the stone the same way as he does the moon: and both being globes, when we put ourselves into the above situation, the moon and stone have the same position to our eyes; and therefore we must see as much of the illuminated part of the one as of the other.\n\nThe position of the moon's cusps, or a right line touching the points of her horns, is very differently inclined to the horizon at different hours of the same day of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. Sometimes she stands, as it were, upright on her lower horn, and then such a line is perpendicular to the horizon: when this happens, the is in what the astronomers call the nonagefinal degree; which is the highest point of the ecliptic above the horizontal degree, rizon at that time, and is \\(90^\\circ\\) from both sides of the horizon where it is then cut by the ecliptic. But this never happens when the moon is on the meridian, except when she is at the very beginning of Cancer or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPRICORN\">Capricorn</a>.\n\nThe explanation of the phases of the moon leads us to that of the eclipses; those phenomena which formerly were the subjects of dread and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, but which philosophers have converted to the purposes of utility and instruction. The moon can only become eclipsed by the interposition of an opaque body, which intercepts from it the light of the sun; and it is obvious that this opaque body is the earth, because the eclipses of the moon never happen except when the moon is in opposition, and consequently when the earth is interposed between her and the sun. The globe of the earth projects behind it relatively to the motion of the sun a conical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a>, whose axis is the straight line that joins the centres of the earth and sun, and which terminates at the point when the apparent diameters of these two bodies become equal. The diameters of these bodies seen from the centre of the moon in opposition,\nApparent Motions of the Heavenly Bodies.\n\nThe moon, therefore, would be eclipsed every time that it is in opposition if the plane of its orbit coincided with the ecliptic. But in consequence of the mutual inclination of these two planes the moon, when in opposition, is often elevated above the earth's conical shadow, or depressed below it; and never can pass through that shadow unless when it is near the nodes. If the whole of the moon's disk plunges into the shadow, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECLIPSE\">eclipse</a> is said to be total; if only a part of the disk enters the shadow, the eclipse is said to be partial.\n\nThe mean duration of a revolution of the sun relatively to the nodes of the lunar orbit is 346.61963 days, and is to the duration of a synodical revolution of the moon nearly as 223 to 19. Consequently, after a period of 223 lunar months, the sun and moon return nearly to the same situation relatively to the order of the lunar orbit. Of course the eclipses must return in the same order after every 223 lunations. This gives us an easy method of predicting them. But the inequalities in the motions of the sun and moon occasion sensible differences; besides the return of the two luminaries to the same points relatively to the nodes not being rigorously true, the deviations occasioned by this want of exactness alters at last the order of the eclipses observed during one of these periods.\n\nThe following explanation of the lunar eclipses being more particular, may be acceptable to some of our readers.\n\nThat the moon can never be eclipsed but at the time of her being full, and the reason why she is not eclipsed at every full, has been shown already. In fig. 13, let S be the sun, E the earth, RR the earth's shadow, and B the moon in opposition to the sun: In this situation the earth intercepts the sun's light in its way to the moon; and when the moon touches the earth's shadow at v, she begins to be eclipsed on her eastern limb x, and continues eclipsed until her western limb y leaves the shadow at w: at B she is in the middle of the shadow, and consequently in the middle of the eclipse.\n\nThe moon, when totally eclipsed, is not invisible if she be above the horizon and the sky be clear; but appears generally of a dusky <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, like tarnished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, which some have thought to be the moon's native light. But the true cause of her being visible is the scattered beams of the sun, bent into the earth's shadow by going through the atmosphere; which, being more or less dense near the earth than at considerable heights above it, refracts or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENDS\">bends</a> the sun's rays more inward, the nearer they are passing by the earth's surface, than those rays which go through higher parts of the atmosphere, where it is less dense according to its height, until it be so thin or rare as to lose its refractive power. Let the circle f, g, h, i, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCENTRIC\">concentric</a> to the earth, include the atmosphere whose refractive power vanishes at the heights f and i; so that the rays Wfvw and Vivi go on straight without suffering the least refraction: but all those rays which enter the atmosphere between f and k, and between i and l, on opposite sides of the earth, are gradually more bent inward as they go through a greater portion of the atmosphere, until the rays Wk and Vl touching the earth at m and n, are bent so much as to meet at q, a little short of the moon; and therefore the dark shadow of the earth is contained in the space mopqn, where none of the sun's rays can enter; all the rest R, R, being mixed by the scattered rays which are refracted as above, is in some measure enlightened by them; and some of those rays falling on the moon, give her the colour of tarnished copper or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> hot. So that if the earth had no atmosphere, the moon would be as invisible in total eclipses as she is when new. If the moon were so near the earth as to go into its dark shadow, suppose about p o, she would be invisible during her stay in it; but visible before and after in the fainter shadow RR.\n\nWhen the moon goes through the centre of the earth's shadow she is directly opposite to the sun; yet the moon has been often seen totally eclipsed in the horizon when the sun was also visible in the opposite part of it; for the horizontal refraction being almost 34 minutes of a degree, and the diameter of the sun and moon being each at a mean state but 32 minutes, the refraction causes both luminaries to appear above the horizon when they are really below it.\n\nWhen the moon is full at 12 degrees from either of her nodes, she just touches the earth's shadow, but enters not into it. In fig. 14, let GH be the ecliptic, ef the moon's orbit where she is 12 degrees from the node at her full, cd her orbit where she is 6 degrees from the node, ab her orbit where she is full in the node, AB the earth's shadow, and M the moon. When the moon describes the line ef, she just touches the shadow, but does not enter into it; when she describes the line cd, she is totally, though not centrally, immersed in the shadow; and when she describes the line ab, she passes by the node at M in the centre of the shadow, and takes the longest line possible, which is a diameter, through it: and such an eclipse being both total and central, is of the longest duration, namely, 3 h. 57 m. 6 sec. from the beginning to the end, if the moon be at her greatest distance from the earth; and 3 h. 37 m. 26 sec. if she be at her least distance. The reason of this difference is, that when the moon is fartherest from the earth, she moves slowest; and when nearest to it, quickest.\n\nThe moon's diameter, as well as the sun's, is supposed to be divided into 12 equal parts, called digits; and so many of these parts as are darkened by the earth's shadow, so many digits is the moon eclipsed. All that the moon is eclipsed above 12 digits, shows how far the shadow of the earth is over the body of the moon, on that edge to which she is nearest at the middle of the eclipse.\n\nIt is difficult to observe exactly either the beginning or ending of a lunar eclipse, even with a good telescope, eclipses because the earth's shadow is too faint and ill-defined, difficulty about the edges, that when the moon is either just touching or leaving it, the obscuration of her limb is scarcely sensible; and therefore the nicest observers can hardly be certain to four or five seconds of time.\nApparent Motions of the Heavenly Bodies.\n\nThe eclipses of the sun only take place during the conjunctions of the sun and moon, or when the moon is placed between the sun and the earth. They are owing to the moon concealing the sun from the earth, or to the earth being plunged in the shadow of the moon. The moon is indeed much smaller than the sun; but it is so much nearer to the earth that its apparent diameter does not differ much from the diameter of that luminary; and, in consequence, of the changes which take place in the apparent diameters of these bodies, it happens that sometimes the apparent diameter of the moon is greater than that of the sun. If we suppose the centres of the sun and moon in the same straight line with the eye of a spectator placed on the earth, he will see the sun eclipsed. If the apparent diameter of the moon happens to surpass that of the sun, the eclipse will be total; but if the moon's diameter be smaller, the observer will see a luminous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a>, formed by that part of the sun's disk which exceeds that of the moon's, and the eclipse will in that case be annular. If the centre of the moon is not in the same straight line which joins the observer and the centre of the sun, the eclipse can only be partial, as the moon can only conceal a part of the sun's disk. Hence there must be a great variety in the appearance of the solar eclipses.\n\nWe may add also to these causes of variety the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of the moon above the horizon, which changes its apparent diameter considerably. For it is well known, that the moon's diameter appears larger when she is near the horizon than when she is elevated far above it. Now, as the moon's height above the horizon varies according to the longitude of the observer, it follows, that the solar eclipses will not have the same appearance to the observers situated in different longitudes. One observer may see an eclipse which does not happen relatively to another. In this respect the solar differ from the lunar eclipses, which are the same to all the inhabitants of the earth.\n\nIn any year, the number of eclipses of both luminaries cannot be less than two, nor more than seven; the most usual number is four, and it is very rare to have more than six. For the sun passes by both the nodes but once a year, unless he passes by one of them in the beginning of the year; and, if he does, he will pass by the same node again a little before the year be finished; because, as these points move 19\u00b0 degrees backwards every year, the sun will come to either of them 173 days after the other. And when either node is within 17 degrees of the sun at the time of new moon, the sun will be eclipsed. At the subsequent opposition, the moon will be eclipsed in the other node, and come round to the next conjunction again ere the former node be 17 degrees past the sun, and will therefore eclipse him again. When three eclipses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> about either node, the like number generally falls about the opposite; as the sun comes to it in 173 days afterwards; and six lunations contain but four days more. Thus, there may be two eclipses of the sun and one of the moon about each of her nodes. But when the moon changes in either of the nodes, she cannot be near enough the other node at the next full Motions of to be eclipsed; and in six lunar months afterward she will change near the other node: in these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, there can be but two eclipses in a year, and they are both of the sun.\n\nA longer period than the above-mentioned, for comparing and examining eclipses which happen at long intervals of time, is 557 years, 21 days, 18 hours, 30 minutes, 11 seconds; in which time there are 6890 mean lunations; and the sun and moon meet again so nearly as to be but 11 seconds distant; but then it is not the same eclipse that returns, as in the shorter period above mentioned.\n\nEclipses of the sun are more frequent than of the moon, because the sun's elliptic limits are greater than those of the moon's; yet we have more visible eclipses of the moon than of the sun, because eclipses of the moon are often seen from all parts of that hemisphere of the earth served, which is next her, and are equally great to each of those parts; but the sun's eclipses are visible only to that small portion of the hemisphere next him whereon the moon's shadow falls.\n\nThe moon's orbit being elliptical, and the earth in one of its foci, she is once at her least distance from the earth, and once at her greatest, in every lunation. When the moon changes at her least distance from the Total and earth, and so near the node that her dark shadow falls annular upon the earth, she appears big enough to cover the whole disk of the sun from that part on which her shadow falls; and the sun appears totally eclipsed there for some minutes; but when the moon changes at her greatest distance from the earth, and so near the node that her dark shadow is directed towards the earth, her diameter subtends a less angle than the sun's; and therefore she cannot hide his whole disk from any part of the earth, nor does her shadow reach it at that time; and to the place over which the point of her shadow hangs, the eclipse is annular, the sun's edge appearing like a luminous ring all round the body of the moon.\n\nWhen the change happens within 17 degrees of the node, and the moon at her mean distance from the earth, the point of her shadow just touches the earth, and she eclipseth the sun totally to that small spot whereon her shadow falls; but the darkness is not of a moment's continuance.\n\nThe moon's apparent diameter, when largest, exceeds the sun's, when least, only 1 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> 38 seconds of a degree; and in the greatest eclipse of the sun that can happen at any time and place, the total darkness continues no longer than whilst the moon is going 1 minute 38 seconds from the sun in her orbit, which is about 3 minutes and 13 seconds of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>.\n\nThe moon's dark shadow covers only a spot on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of earth's surface about 180 English miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, when the moon's diameter appears largest, and the sun's least; and the total darkness can extend no farther than the dark shadow covers. Yet the moon's partial shadow or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENUMBRA\">penumbra</a> may then cover a circular space 4900 miles in diameter, within all which the sun is more or less eclipsed, as the places are less or more distant from the centre of the penumbra. When the moon changes exactly\nPart ii.\n\nAstronomy.\n\nExactly in the node, the penumbra is circular on the earth at the middle of the general eclipse; because at that time it falls perpendicularly on the earth's surface; but at every other moment it falls obliquely, and will therefore be elliptical; and the more so, as the time is longer before or after the middle of the general eclipse; and then much greater portions of the earth's surface are involved in the penum'ra.\n\nWhen the penumbra first touches the earth, the general eclipse begins; when it leaves the earth, the general eclipse ends: from the beginning to the end the sun appears eclipsed in some part of the earth or other. When the penumbra touches any place, the eclipse begins at that place, and ends when the penumbra leaves it. When the moon changes in the node, the penumbra goes over the centre of the earth's disk as seen from the moon; and consequently, by describing the longest line possible on the earth, continues the longest upon it; namely, at a mean rate, 5 hours 50 minutes; more, if the moon be at her greatest distance from the earth, because she then moves slower; less, if she be at her least distance, because of her quicker motion.\n\nTo make several of the above and other phenomena plainer, let S be the sun, E the earth, M the moon, and AMP the moon's orbit. Draw the right line We from the western side of the sun at W, touching the western side of the moon at c, and the earth at e; draw also the right line Vd from the eastern side of the sun at V, touching the eastern side of the moon at d, and the earth at e; the disk space ce'd included between those lines is the moon's shadow, ending in a point at e, where it touches the earth; because in this case the moon is supposed to change at M in the middle between A the apogee, or farthest point of her orbit from the earth, and P the perigee, or nearest point to it. For, had the point P been at M, the moon had been nearer the earth; and her dark shadow at e would have covered a space upon it about 180 miles broad, and the sun would have been totally darkened, with some continuance; but had the point A been at M, the moon would have been farther from the earth, and her shadow would have ended in a point a little above e, and therefore the sun would have appeared like a luminous ring all around the moon. Draw the right lines WX db and VX cg, touching the contrary sides of the sun and moon, and ending on the earth at a and b; draw also the right line SX'M, from the centre of the sun's disk, through the moon's centre, to the earth; and suppose the two former lines WX db and VX cg to revolve on the line SX'M as an axis, and their points a and b will describe the limits of the penumbra TT on the earth's surface, including the large space ab'a; within which the sun appears more or less eclipsed, as the places are more or less distant from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERGE\">verge</a> of the penumbra ab'.\n\nDraw the right line y r2 across the sun's disk, perpendicular to SX'M the axis of the penumbra; then divide the line y r2 into twelve equal parts, as in the figure, for the twelve digits or equal parts of the sun's diameter; and at equal distances from the centre of the penumbra at e (on the earth's surface YY) to its edge ab', draw twelve concentric circles, marked with the numeral figures 1 2 3 4, &c., and remember that\n\nVol. III, Part I.\nApparent T the tropic of Cancer, \\( \\theta \\) the tropic of Capricorn, and ABC the circumference of the earth's enlightened disk as seen from the sun or new moon at these times. The earth's axis has the position NES at the vernal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUINOX\">equinox</a>, lying towards the right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, as seen from the sun or new moon; its poles N and S being then in the circumference of the disk; and the equator and all its parallels seem to be straight lines, because their planes pass through the observer's eye looking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> upon the earth from the sun or moon directly over E, where the ecliptic FG intersects the equator AE. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLSTICE\">solstice</a> the earth's axis has the position NDS; and that part of the ecliptic FG, in which the moon is then new, touches the tropic of Cancer T at D. The north pole N at that time inclining 23\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) degrees towards the sun, falls so many degrees within the earth's enlightened disk, because the sun is then vertical to D 23\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) degrees north of the equator or AEQ; and the equator, with all its parallels seem elliptic curves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> downward, or towards the south pole, as seen from the sun; which pole, together with 23\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) degrees all round it, is hid behind the disk in the dark hemisphere of the earth. At the autumnal equinox, the earth's axis has the position NOS, lying to the left hand as seen from the sun or new moon, which are then vertical to O, where the ecliptic cuts the equator AEQ. Both poles now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in the circumference of the disk, the north pole just going to disappear behind it, and the south pole just entering into it; and the equator with all its parallels seem to be straight lines, because their planes pass through the observer's eye, as seen from the sun, and very nearly so as seen from the moon. At the winter solstice, the earth's axis has the position NNS when its south pole S inclining 23\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) degrees towards the sun, falls 23\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) degrees within the enlightened disk, as seen from the sun or new moon, which are then vertical to the tropic of Capricorn \\( \\theta \\), 23\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) degrees south of the equator AEQ; and the equator, with all its parallels, seem elliptic curves bending upward; the north pole being as far hid behind the disk in the dark hemisphere as the south pole is come into the light. The nearer that any time of the year is to the equinoxes or solstices, the more it partakes of the phenomena relating to them.\n\nThus it appears, that from the vernal equinox to the autumnal, the north pole is enlightened; and the equator and all its parallels appear elliptical as seen from the sun, more or less curved as the time is nearer to, or farther from, the summer solstice; and bending downwards, or towards the south pole; the reverse of which happens from the autumnal equinox to the vernal. A little consideration will be sufficient to convince the reader, that the earth's axis inclines towards the sun at the summer solstice; from the sun at the winter solstice; and sidewise to the sun at the equinoxes; but towards the right hand, as seen from the sun at the vernal equinox; and towards the left hand at the autumnal. From the winter to the summer solstice, the earth's axis inclines more or less to the right hand, as seen from the sun; and the contrary from the summer to the winter solstice.\n\nThe different positions of the earth's axis, as seen from the sun at different times of the year, affect solar eclipses greatly with regard to particular places; yea, so far as would make central eclipses which fall at one time of the year invisible if they fell at another, even though the moon should always change in the nodes, and at the same hour of the day; of which indefinitely various affections, we shall only give examples for the times of the equinoxes and solstices.\n\nIn the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DIAGRAM\">diagram</a>, let FG be part of the ecliptic, and IK, \\( \\theta \\), \\( \\theta \\), \\( \\theta \\), part of the moon's orbit; the position both seen edgeways, and therefore projected into right of the lines; and let the intersections NODE be one and the earth's axis, same node at the above times, when the earth has the forementioned different positions; and let the spaces included by the circles PpPp be the penumbra at these times, as its centre is passing over the centre of the earth's disk. At the winter solstice, when the earth's axis has the position NNS, the centre of the penumbra P touches the tropic of Capricorn \\( \\theta \\) in N at the middle of the general eclipse; but no part of the penumbra touches the tropic of Cancer T. At the summer solstice, when the earth's axis has the position NDS (D being then part of the moon's orbit whole node is at D), the penumbra p has its centre at D, on the tropic of Cancer T, at the middle of the general eclipse, and then no part of it touches the tropic of Capricorn \\( \\theta \\). At the autumnal equinox, the earth's axis has the position NOS (O being then part of the moon's orbit), and the penumbra equally includes part of both tropics T and \\( \\theta \\), at the middle of the general eclipse: at the vernal equinox it does the same, because the earth's axis has the position NES; but, in the former of these two last cases, the penumbra enters the earth at A, north of the tropic of Cancer T, and leaves it at m south of the tropic of Capricorn \\( \\theta \\); having gone over the earth obliquely southward, as its centre described the line AOni; whereas, in the latter case, the penumbra touches the earth at n, south of the equator AEQ, and describing the line nEg (similar to the former line AOni in open space), goes obliquely northward over the earth, and leaves it at g, north of the equator.\n\nIn all these circumstances the moon has been supposed to change at noon in her ascending node: Had the change in her ascending node, the phenomena would have been as various the contrary way, with respect to the penumbra's going northward or southward over the earth. But because the moon changes at all hours, as often in one node as in the other, and at all distances from them both at different times as it happens, the variety of the phases of eclipses are almost innumerable, even at the same places; considering also how variously the same places are situated on the enlightened disk of the earth, with respect to the penumbra's motion, at the different hours when eclipses happen.\n\nWhen the moon changes 17 degrees short of her descending node, the penumbra Pi8 just touches the northern part of the earth's disk, near the north pole N; and as seen from that place, the moon appears to touch the sun, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HIDES\">hides</a> no part of him from sight. Had the change been as far short of the ascending node, the penumbra would have touched the southern part of the disk near the fourth pole S. When the moon changes 12 degrees short of the descending node, more than a third part of the penumbra Pi2 falls on the northern parts of the earth at the middle of the general eclipse: Had the change as far past the same node,\nPart II.\n\nApparent Motions of the Heavenly Bodies.\n\nAs much of the other side of the penumbra about P would have fallen on the southern parts of the earth; all the rest in the expanse, or open space. When the moon changes 6 degrees from the node, almost the whole penumbra P6 falls on the earth at the middle of the general eclipse. And lastly, when the moon changes in the node at N, the penumbra PN takes the longest course possible on the earth's disk; its centre falling on the middle thereof, at the middle of the general eclipse. The farther the moon changes from either node, within 17 degrees of it, the shorter is the penumbra's continuance on the earth, because it goes over a less portion of the disk, as is evident by the figure.\n\nThe nearer that the penumbra's centre is to the equator at the middle of the general eclipse, the longer is the duration of the eclipse at all those places where it is central; because, the nearer that any place is to the equator, the greater is the circle it describes by the earth's motion on its axis; and so, the place moving quicker, keeps longer in the penumbra, whose motion is the same way with that of the place, though faster, as has been already mentioned. Thus (see the earth at D and the penumbra at 12) whilst the point b in the polar circle abcd is carried from b to c by the earth's diurnal motion, the point d on the tropic of Cancer T is carried a much greater length from d to D; and therefore, if the penumbra's centre goes one time over c and another time over D, the penumbra will be longer in passing over the moving place d than it was in passing over the moving place b. Consequently, central eclipses about the poles are of the shortest duration; and about the equator, of the longest.\n\nIn the middle of summer, the whole frigid zone, included by the polar circle abcd, is enlightened; and if it then happens that the penumbra's centre goes over the north pole, the sun will be eclipsed much the same number of digits at a as at c; but whilst the penumbra moves eastward over c, it moves eastward over a; because, with respect to the penumbra, the motions of a and c are contrary: for c moves the same way with the penumbra towards d, but a moves the contrary way towards b; and therefore the eclipse will be of longer duration at c than at a. At a the eclipse begins on the sun's eastern limb, but at c on his western: at all places lying without the polar circles, the sun's eclipses begin on his western limb, or near it, and end on or near his eastern. At those places where the penumbra touches the earth, the eclipse begins with the rising sun, on the top of his western or uppermost edge; and at those places where the penumbra leaves the earth, the eclipse ends with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> sun, on the top of his eastern edge, which is then the uppermost, just at its disappearing in the horizon.\n\nAbout the new moon, that part of the lunar disk which is not illuminated by the sun is perceptible, owing to the feeble light reflected on it by the hemisphere of the earth that is illuminated.\n\nSect. II. Of the Nature of the Moon.\n\nMoon's size. We have seen that the moon is about 39 times smaller than the earth. Her diameter is generally reckoned about 2180 miles. This is to the diameter of the earth nearly as 20 to 73; therefore, the surface of the moon is to that of the earth (being as the squares of their diameters) nearly as 1 to 144. And, admitting the moon's density to be to that of the earth as 5 to 4, their respective quantities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> will be as 1 to 39 very nearly.\n\nBouguer has shown by a set of curious experiments that the light emitted by the full moon is 300,000 times less intense than that of the sun. Even when concentrated by the most powerful mirrors it produces no effect on the thermometer.\n\nMany darkish spots may be seen upon the moon's spots on her disk, even with the naked eye; and through a telescope, their number is prodigiously increased: the albedo appears very plainly to be more protuberant in the middle than at the edges, or to have the figure of a globe and not a flat circle. When the moon is horned or gibbous, the one side appears very ragged and uneven, but the other always exactly defined and circular. The spots in the moon always keep their places exactly; never vanishing, or going from one side to the other, as those of the sun do. We sometimes see more or less of the northern and southern, and eastern and western part of the disk or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a>; but this is owing to what is called her libration, and will hereafter be explained.\n\nThe astronomers Florentius, Langrenus, John Hevelius of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DANTZIC\">Dantzic</a>, Grimaldus, Ricciolus, Caffini, and M. de la Hire, have drawn the face of the moon as she is seen through telescopes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNIFYING\">magnifying</a> between 200 and 300 times. Particular care has been taken to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> all the shining parts in her surface; and, for the better distinguishing them, each has been marked with a proper name. Langrenus and Ricciolus have divided the lunar regions among the philosophers, astronomers, and other eminent men; but Hevelius and others, fearing that the philosophers should quarrel about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of their lands, have endeavoured to spoil them of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, by giving the names belonging to different countries, islands, and seas on earth, to different parts of the moon's surface, without regard to situation or figure. The names adopted by Ricciolus, however, are those which are generally followed, as the names of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HIPPARCHUS\">Hipparchus</a>, Tycho, Copernicus, &c., are more pleasing to astronomers than those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">Sea</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, and Mount Etna. Fig. 17 is a tolerably exact representation of the full moon in her mean libration, with the numbers to the principal spots according to Ricciolus, Caffini, Mayer, &c. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTERISK\">asterisk</a> refers to one of the volcanoes discovered by Dr Herschel, to be afterwards more particularly noticed. The names are as follows:\n\n* Herschel's Volcano.\n1 Grimaldus.\n2 Galileo.\n3 Arifarchus.\n4 Keplerus.\n5 Gaffendus.\n6 Shikardus.\n7 Harpalus.\n8 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HERACLIDES\">Heraclides</a>.\n9 Lanbergius.\n10 Reinoldus.\n11 Copernicus.\n12 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HELICON\">Helicon</a>.\n13 Capuanus.\n14 Bullialdus.\n15 Eratothene.\n\n16 Timocharis.\n17 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>.\n18 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a>.\n19 Insula <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SINUS\">Sinus</a> Medii.\n20 Pitatus.\n21 Tycho.\n22 Eudoxus.\n23 Arifoteles.\n24 Manilius.\n25 Menelaus.\n26 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HERMES\">Hermes</a>.\n27 Posidonius.\n28 Dionysius.\n29 Plinius.\n30 Catharina Cyrillus.\n31 Theophilus.\n32 Fracastorius.\nThat there are prodigious inequalities on her surface, is proved by looking at her through a telescope, at any other time than when she is full; for then there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> line bounding light and darkness: but the confines of these parts appear as it were toothed and cut with innumerable notches and breaks: and even in the dark part, near the borders of the lucid surface, there are seen some small spaces enlightened by the sun's beams. Upon the fourth day after new moon, there may be perceived some shining points like rocks or small islands within the dark body of the moon; but not far from the confines of light and darkness there are observed other little spaces which join to the enlightened surface, but run out into the dark side, which by degrees change their figure, till at last they come wholly within the illuminated face, and have no dark parts round them at all. Afterwards many more shining spaces are observed to arise by degrees, and to appear within the dark side of the moon, which before they drew near to the confines of light and darkness were invisible, being without any light, and totally immersed in the shadow. The contrary is observed in the decreasing phases, where the lucid spaces which joined the illuminated surface by degrees recede from it, and, after they are quite separated from the confines of light and darkness, remain for some time visible, till at last they also disappear. Now it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> that this should be the case, unless these shining points were higher than the rest of the surface, so that the light of the sun may reach them.\n\nNot content with perceiving the bare <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of these lunar mountains, astronomers have endeavoured to measure their height in the following manner. Let EGD be the hemisphere of the moon illuminated by the sun, ECD the diameter of the circle bounding light and darkness, and A the top of a hill within the dark part when it first begins to be illuminated. Observe with a telescope the proportion of the right line AE, or the distance of the point A from the lucid surface to the diameter of the moon ED; and because in this case the ray of light ES touches the globe of the moon, AEC will be a right angle by 16th prop. of Euclid's third book; and therefore in the triangle AEC having the two sides AE and EC, we can find out the third side AC; from which subducting BC or EC, there will remain AB the height of the mountain. Ricciolus affirms, that upon the fourth day after new moon he has observed the top of the hill called St Catharine's to be illuminated, and that it was distant from the confines of the lucid surface about a sixteenth part of the moon's diameter. Therefore, if CF = 8, AE will be 1, and AC\u00b2 = CE\u00b2 + AE\u00b2 by prop. 47. of Euclid's first book. Now, the square of CE being 64, and the square of AE being 1, the square of AC will be 65, whose square root is 8.62, which expresses the length of AC. From which deducing BC = 8, there will remain AC = 9.62. So that CB or CE is therefore to AB as 8 is to 9.62, that is, as 8000 is to 62.\n\nIf the diameter of the moon therefore was known, the height of this mountain would also be known. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> is taken from Dr Keill, who supposes the semidiameter of the moon to be 1182 miles; according to which, the mountain must be somewhat more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> miles of perpendicular height: but astronomers having now determined the moon's semidiameter to be only 1000 miles, the height of the mountain will be nearly 8\u00bd miles.\n\nIn the former edition of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, we could not help making some remarks on the improbability that the lunar mountains of the moon, a planet so much inferior overrated in size to the earth, should exceed in such vast proportion the highest of our mountains, which are computed at little more than one-third of the height just mentioned. Our remark is now confirmed by the observations of Dr Herschel. After explaining the method used by Galileo, Hevelius, &c., for measuring them, the lunar mountains, he tells us, that the former takes the distance of the top of a lunar mountain from the line that divides the illuminated part of the disk from that which is in the shade to be equal to one-twentieth of the moon's diameter; but Hevelius makes it only one twenty-fifth. When we calculate the height of such a mountain, therefore, it will be found, according to Galileo, almost 5\u00bd miles; and according to Hevelius 3\u00bd miles, admitting the moon's diameter to be 2180 miles. Mr Ferguson, however, says (Astronomy Explained, \u00a7 252.), that some of her mountains, by comparing their height with her diameter, are found to be three times higher than the highest hills on earth; and Keill, in his Astronomical Lectures, has calculated the height of St Catharine's hill, according to the observations of Ricciolus, and finds it nine miles. Having premised these accounts, Dr Herschel explains his method of taking the height of a lunar mountain from observations made when the moon was not in her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUADRATURE\">quadrature</a>, as the method laid down by Hevelius answers only to that particular case; for in all others the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a> must appear shorter than it really is. \"Let SLM, says he, or J/m, (fig. 96.) be a line drawn from the sun to the mountain touching the moon at L or J, and the mountain at M or m. Then, to an observer at E, or e, the lines LM, /m, will not appear of the same length, though the mountain should be of an equal height; for LM will be projected into o n, and /m into ON. But these are the quantities that are taken by the micrometer when we observe a mountain to project from the line of illumination. From the observed quantity o n, when the moon is not in her quadrature, to find LM, we have the following analogy. The triangles o OL, r ML, are similar; therefore LO : LO :: LR : LM, or \\(\\frac{LO + on}{Lo} = LM\\). But LO is the radius of the moon, and LR or on is the observed distance of the mountain's projection; and LO is the sine of the angle ROL = o LS; which we may take to be the distance of the sun from the moon without any material error, and which therefore we may find at any given time from an ephemeris.\n\nThe telescope used in these observations was a Newtonian\nApparent Newtonian reflector of six feet eight inches focal length, to which a micrometer was adapted, consisting of two parallel hairs, one of which was moveable by means of a fine screw. The value of the parts shown by the index was determined by a trigonometrical observation of a known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> at a known distance, and was verified by several trials. The power was always 222, excepting where another is expressly mentioned; and this was also determined by experiment, which frequently differs from theory on account of some small errors in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a>, hardly to be avoided. The moon having sufficient light, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a> of no more than four inches was made use of; and, says Dr Herschel, \"I believe, that for distinctness of vision, this instrument is perhaps equal to any that ever was made.\"\n\nWith this instrument he observed a prominence, which he calls a rock; situated near the Lacus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGER\">Niger</a> of Hevelius, and found that it projected 41\u00b056\u2032. To reduce this into miles, put R for the semidiameter of the moon in seconds, as given by the nautical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALMANACK\">almanack</a> at the time of observation, and Q for the observed quantity, also in seconds and centesimal; then it will be in general, \\( \\frac{1090}{R} : \\frac{1090Q}{R} = n \\) in miles.\n\nThus it is found, that 41\u00b056\u2032 is 46.79 miles. The distance of the sun from the moon at that time was, by the nautical almanack, about 93\u00b057\u2032; the fine of which to the radius 1 is .9985, &c., and \\( \\frac{n}{L_o} \\) in this case is LM = 46.85 miles. Then, by Hevelius's method, the perpendicular height of the rock is found to be about one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>. At the same time, a great many rocks, situated about the middle of the disk, projected from 25\u00b002\u2032 to 26\u00b056\u2032; which gives \\( \\frac{n}{L_o} \\) about 29.3 miles; so that these rocks are all less than half a mile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>.\n\nThese observations were made on the 13th of November 1779. On the 13th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1780, examining the mountains of the moon, he found that there was not one of them fairly placed on level <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, which is very necessary for an exact measurement of the projection: for if there should be a declivity on the moon before the mountains, or a tract of hills placed so as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> a shadow upon that part before them which would otherwise be illuminated, the projection would appear too large; and, on the contrary, should there be a rising ground before them, it would appear too little.\n\nProceeding in this cautious manner, Dr Herschel measured the height of many of the lunar prominences, and draws at last the following conclusions.\u2014\"From these observations I believe it is evident, that the height of the lunar mountains in general is greatly over-rated; and that, when we have excepted a few, the generality do not exceed half a mile in their perpendicular elevation. It is not so easy to find any certain mountain exactly in the same situation it has been measured in before; therefore some little difference must be expected in these measures. Hitherto I have not had an opportunity of particularly observing the three mountains mentioned by Hevelius; nor that which Riccius has found to project a sixteenth part of the moon's diameter. If Keill had calculated the height of this last-mentioned hill according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEOREM\">theorem</a> I had given, Apparent Motions of the Heavenly Bodies. he would have found (supposing the observation to have been made, as he says, on the fourth day after the new moon) that its perpendicular height could not well be less than between 11 and 12 miles. I shall not fail to take the first opportunity of observing these four, and every other mountain of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a>; and if other persons, who are furnished with good telescopes and micrometers, would take the quantity of the projection of the lunar mountains, I make no doubt but that we would be nearly as well acquainted with their heights as we are with the elevation of our own. One caution I would beg leave to mention to those who may use the excellent 3\u00bd feet refractors of Mr Dollond. The admirable quantity of light, which Dollond's on most occasions is so desirable, will probably give telegraphs the measure of the projection somewhat larger than the true, if not guarded against by proper limitations placed before the object-glass. I have taken no notice of any allowance to be made for the refraction: a ray of light must suffer in passing through the atmosphere of the moon, when it illuminates the top of the mountain, whereby its apparent height will be lessened, as we are too little acquainted with that atmosphere to take it into consideration. It is also to be observed, that this would equally affect the conclusions of Hevelius, and therefore the difference in our inferences would still remain the same.\"\n\nIn the continuations of his observations, Dr Herschel informs us, that he had measured the height of one of the mountains which had been measured by Hevelius. \"Antaurus (says he), the mountain measured by Hevelius, was badly situated; because Mount Molochus and its neighbouring hills cast a deep shadow, which may be mistaken for the natural convexity of the moon. A good, full, but just measure, 25\u00b0105\u2032; in miles, 29.27; therefore LM = 31.7 miles, and the perpendicular height not quite half a mile. As great exactness was desired in this observation, it was repeated with very nearly the same result. Several other mountains were measured by the same method; and all his observations concurred in making the height of the lunar mountains much less than what former astronomers had done. Mount Lipulus was found to be near two-thirds of a mile; one of the Apennine mountains, between Lacus Thraenum and Pontus Euxinus, measured a mile and a quarter; Mons <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMENIA\">Armenia</a>, near Taurus, two thirds of a mile; Mons Leucoptera three-quarters of a mile. Mons Sacer projected 45\u00b0625\u2032; 'but (says he) I am almost certain that there are two very considerable cavities or places where the ground descends below the level of the convexity, just before these mountains; so that these measures must of course be a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> too large: but supposing them to be just, it follows, that \\( \\frac{n}{L_o} \\) is 50.103 miles, LM = 64 miles, and the perpendicular height above 1\u00bd miles.'\n\nAs the moon has on its surface mountains and valleys in common with the earth, some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> astronomers have discovered a still greater similarity, viz. that some of these are really volcanoes, emitting fire as those on earth do. An appearance of this kind was discovered some years ago by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Ulloa in an eclipse of the sun. It was a small bright spot like a star near the margin of the moon, and which he at that time supposed to have been a hole with the sun's light shining through.\nApparent Motions of the Heavenly Bodies.\n\nSucceeding observations, however, have induced astronomers to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> appearances of this kind to the eruption of volcanic fire; and Dr. Herschel has particularly observed several eruptions of the lunar volcanoes, the last of which he gives an account of in the Phil. Trans. for 1787. \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 19. 10 h. 36' sidereal time. I perceive (says he) three volcanoes in different places of the dark part of the new moon. Two of them are either already nearly extinct, or otherwise in a state of going to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> out; which perhaps may be decided next lunation. The third shows an actual eruption of fire or luminous matter. I measured the distance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRATER\">crater</a> from the northern limb of the moon, and found it 3\u00b0 57.3\" its light is much brighter than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUCLEUS\">nucleus</a> of the comet which M. Mechain discovered at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> the 10th of this month.\n\n\"April 20. 10 h. 2 m. sidereal time. The volcano burns with greater violence than last night. Its diameter cannot be less than 4\u00b0, by comparing it with that of the Georgian planet: as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> was near at hand, I turned the telescope to his third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATELLITE\">satellite</a>, and estimated the diameter of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> part of the volcano to be equal to at least twice that of the satellite; whence we may compute that the shining or burning matter must be above three miles in diameter. It is of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> round figure, and very sharply defined on the edges. The other two volcanoes are much farther towards the centre of the moon, and resemble large, pretty faint nebulae, that are gradually much brighter in the middle; but no well-defined luminous spot can be discerned in them. These three spots are plainly to be distinguished from the rest of the marks upon the moon; for the reflection of the sun's rays from the earth is, in its present situation, sufficiently bright, with a ten feet reflector, to show the moon's spots, even the darkest of them; nor did I perceive any similar phenomena last lunation, though I then viewed the same places with the same instrument.\n\n\"The appearance of what I have called the actual fire, or eruption of a volcano, exactly resembled a small piece of burning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> when it is covered by a very thin coat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a>, which frequently adhere to it when it has been some time ignited; and it had a degree of brightness about as strong as that with which such a coal would be seen to glow in faint daylight. All the adjacent parts of the volcanic mountain seemed to be faintly illuminated by the eruption, and were gradually more obscure as they lay at a greater distance from the crater. This eruption resembled much that which I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> on the 4th of May in the year 1783, but differed considerably in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> and brightness; for the volcano of the year 1783, though much brighter than that which is now burning, was not nearly so large in the dimensions of its eruption: the former seen in the telescope resembled a star of the fourth magnitude as it appears to the naked eye; this, on the contrary, shows a visible disk of luminous matter very different from the sparkling brightnesses of star-light.\"\n\nConcerning the nature of the moon's substance there have been many conjectures formed. Some have imagined, that, besides the light reflected from the sun, the moon hath also some obscure light of her own, by which she would be visible without being illuminated by the sunlight. In proof of this it is urged, that during the time of even total eclipses the moon is still visible, appearing of a dull red colour, as if obscured by a great deal of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>. In reply to this it hath been advanced, that this is not always the case; the moon sometimes disappearing totally in the time of an eclipse, so as not to be discernible by the best glasses, while little stars of the fifth and sixth magnitudes were distinctly seen as usual. This phenomenon was observed by Kepler twice, in the years 1580 and 1583; and by Hevelius in 1620. Riccioli and other Jesuits at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>, and many people throughout <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, observed the same on April 14, 1642; yet at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> and Vienna she was all the time conspicuous. In the year 1703, Dec. 23, there was another total obscuration. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARLES\">Arles</a>, she appeared of a yellowish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>; at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVIGNON\">Avignon</a>, ruddy and transparent, as if the sun had shone through her; at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARSEILLES\">Marseilles</a>, one part was reddish and the other very dusky; and at length, though in a clear sky, she totally disappeared. The general reason for her appearance at all during the time of eclipses shall be given afterwards: but as for these particular phenomena, they have not yet, as far as we know, been satisfactorily accounted for.\n\nDifferent conjectures have also been formed concerning the spots on the moon's surface. Some philosophers have been so taken with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of the brightest places observed in her disk, that they have imagined them to be rocks of diamonds; and others have compared them to pearls and precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>. Dr. Keill and the greatest part of astronomers now are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that these are only the tops of mountains, which by reason of their elevation are more capable of reflecting the sun's light than others which are lower. The darkish spots, he says, cannot be seas, nor anything of a liquid substance; because, when examined by the telescope, they appear to consist of an infinity of caverns and empty pits, whose shadows fall within them, which can never be the case with seas, or any liquid substance: but, even within these spots, brighter places are also to be observed; which, according to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, ought to be the points of rocks standing up within the cavities. Dr. Long, however, is of opinion, that several of the dark spots on the moon are really <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. May not the lunar seas and lakes (says he) have islands in them, wherein there may be pits and caverns? And if some of these dark parts be brighter than others, may not that be owing to the seas and lakes being of different depths, and to their having rocks in some places and flats in others?\n\nIt has also been urged, that if all the dark spots observed on the moon's surface were really the shadows of mountains, or of the sides of deep pits, they could not possibly be so permanent as they are found to be; but would vary according to the position of the moon with regard to the sun, as we find shadows on earth are varied according as the earth is turned towards or from the sun. Accordingly it is pretended, that variable spots are actually discovered on the moon's disk, and that the direction of these is always opposite to the sun. Hence they are found among those parts which are soonest illuminated in the increasing moon, and in the decreasing moon lose their light sooner than the intermediate ones; running round, and appearing sometimes longer, and sometimes shorter. The permanent\nmanent dark spots, therefore, it is said, must be some matter which is not fitted for reflecting the rays of the sun so much as the bright parts do; and this property, we know by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, belongs to water rather than land; whence these philosophers conclude, that the moon, as well as our earth, is made up of land and seas.\n\nIt has been a matter of dispute whether the moon has any atmosphere or not. The following arguments have been urged by those who take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> side.\n\n1. The moon constantly appears with the same brightness when there are clouds in our atmosphere; which could not be the case if the were surrounded with an atmosphere like ours, so variable in its density, and so frequently obscured by clouds and vapours.\n\n2. In an appulse of the moon to a star, when the comes so near it that part of her atmosphere is interposed between our eye and the star, refraction would cause the latter to seem to change its place, so that the moon would appear to touch it later than by her own motion she would do.\n\n3. Some philosophers are of opinion, that because there are no seas or lakes in the moon, there is therefore no atmosphere, as there is no water to be raised up in vapours.\n\nAll these arguments, however, have been answered by other astronomers in the following manner. 1. It is denied that the moon appears always with the same brightness, even when our atmosphere appears equally clear. Hevelius relates, that he has several times found in skies perfectly clear, when even stars of the sixth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a> magnitude were visible, that at the same altitude of the moon, and the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELONGATION\">elongation</a> from the earth, and with one and the same telescope, the moon and its maculae do not appear equally lucid, clear, and conspicuous, at all times; but are much brighter and more distinct at some times than at others. From the circumstances of this observation, say they, it is evident that the reason of this phenomenon is neither in our air, in the tube, in the moon, nor in the spectator's eye; but must be looked for in something existing about the moon. An additional argument is drawn from the different appearances of the moon already mentioned in total eclipses, which are supposed to be owing to the different constitutions of the lunar atmosphere.\n\nThe second argument Dr Long replies, that Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton has shown (Princip. prop. 37. cor. 5.), that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of any body upon the moon is but a third part of what the weight of the same would be upon the earth; now the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> of the air is reciprocally as the weight that compresses it: the air, therefore, surrounding the moon, being pressed together by a weight, or being attracted towards the centre of the moon by a force equal only to one-third of that which attracts our air towards the centre of the earth, it thence follows, that the lunar atmosphere is only one-third as dense as that of the earth, which is too little to produce any sensible refraction of the star's light. Other astronomers have contended that such refraction was sometimes very apparent. M. Cassini says that he frequently observed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a>, Jupiter, and the fixed stars, to have their circular figure changed into an elliptical one, when they approached either to the moon's dark or illuminated limb; though they own, that in other occultations no such change could be observed. With regard to the fixed stars, indeed, it has been urged, that granting the moon to have an atmosphere of the same nature and quantity as ours, no such effect as a gradual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of light ought to take place; at least, that we could by no means be capable of perceiving it. Our atmosphere is found to be so rare at the height of 44 miles as to be incapable of refracting the rays of light. This height is the 186th part of the earth's diameter; but since clouds are never observed higher than four miles, we must conclude that the vaporous or obscure part is only one 198th. The mean apparent diameter of the moon is 31' 29\", or 1880 seconds: therefore the obscure parts of her atmosphere, when viewed from the earth, must subtend an angle of less than one second; which space is passed over by the moon in less than two seconds of time. It can therefore hardly be expected that observation should generally determine whether the supposed obscuration takes place or not.\n\nThe third argument is necessarily inconclusive, because we know not whether there is any water in the moon or not; nor, though this could be demonstrated, would it follow that the lunar atmosphere answers no other purpose than the raising of water into vapour.\n\nThere is, however, a strong argument in favour of luminous existence of a lunar atmosphere, taken from the ring observed appearance of a luminous ring round the moon in the very about time of solar eclipses. In the eclipse of May 1. 1726, in total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Stanyan, from Bern in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>, writes, eclipses, that \"the sun was totally darkened there for the space of four minutes and a half: that a fixed star and planet appeared very bright: that his getting out of the eclipse was preceded by a blood-red streak of light from his left limb, which continued not longer than six or seven seconds of time; then part of the sun's disk appeared all on a sudden, brighter than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENUS\">Venus</a> was ever seen in the night; and in that very instant gave light and shadow to things as strong as moonlight used to do.\" The publisher of this account observes that the red streak of light preceding the emergence of the sun's body, is a proof that the moon has an atmosphere; and its short continuance of five or six seconds shows that its height is not more than the five or six hundredth part of her diameter.\n\nFatio, who observed the same eclipse at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENEVA\">Geneva</a>, tells us, that \"there was seen during the whole time of the total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMERSION\">immersion</a>, a whiteness which seemed to break out from behind the moon, and to encompass her on all sides equally: this whiteness was not well defined on its outward side, and the breadth of it was not a twelfth part of the diameter of the moon. The planet appeared very black, and her disk very well defined within the whiteness which encompassed it about, and was of the same colour as that of a white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HALO\">halo</a>, of about four or five degrees in diameter, which accompanied it, and had the moon for its centre. A little after the sun had begun to appear again, the whiteness, and the crown which had encompassed the moon, did entirely vanish.\" \"I must add (says Dr Long), that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> is a little perplexed, either through the fault of the author or of the translator; for I suppose Fatio wrote in French: however, it plainly appears by it that the moon's atmosphere was visible, surrounded by a light of larger extent, which\nI think must be that luminous appearance (the zodiacal light) mentioned from Caffini.\" Flamsteed, who published this account, takes notice, that, according to these observations, the altitude of the moon's atmosphere cannot be supposed less than 180 geographical miles; and that probably this atmosphere was never discovered before this eclipse, by reason of the smallness of the refraction, and the want of proper observations.\n\nAn account of the same eclipse, as it appeared at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZURICH\">Zurich</a>, is given by Dr Scheuchzer, in the following words: \"We had an eclipse of the sun, which was both total and annular; total, because the whole sun was covered by the moon; annular, not what is properly so called, but by refraction: for there appeared round the moon a bright shining, which was owing to the rays of the sun refracted through the atmosphere of the moon.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol8.html#article-DOM\">Dom</a>. Caffini, from a number of accounts sent him from different parts, says, that in all those places where it was total, during the time of total darkness, there was seen round the moon a crown or broad circle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> light, the breadth whereof was about a 12th part of the moon's diameter: that at Montpelier, where the observers were particularly attentive to see if they could distinguish the zodiacal light already mentioned, they took notice of a paler light of a larger extent, which surrounded the crown of light before mentioned, and spread itself on each side of it, to the distance of four degrees. He then mentions Kepler's opinion, that the crown of light which appears round the moon during the total darkness in an eclipse of the sun is caused by some celestial matter surrounding the moon, of sufficient density to receive the rays of the sun and send them to us; and that the moon may have an atmosphere similar to that of our earth, which may reflect the sun's light.\n\nA total eclipse of the sun was observed on the 22d of April O.S. in the year 1715, by Dr Halley at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, and by M. Louville of the Academy of Sciences at Paris. Dr Halley relates, that \"when the first part of the sun remained on his east side, it grew very faint, and was easily supportable to the naked eye even through the telescope, for above a minute of time before the total darkness; whereas, on the contrary, the eye could not endure the splendor of the emerging beams through the telescope even from the first moment. To this, two causes perhaps concurred: the one, that the pupil of the eye did necessarily dilate itself during the darkness, which before had been much contracted by looking on the sun: the other, that the eastern parts of the moon, having been heated with a day near as long as 30 of ours, must of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> have that part of its atmosphere replete with vapors raised by the so long continued action of the sun; and, by consequence, it was more dense near the moon's surface, and more capable of obstructing the sun's beams; whereas at the same time the western edge of the moon had suffered all night, during which there might fall in dews all the vapors that were raised in the preceding long day; and for that reason, that that part of its atmosphere might be seen much more pure and transparent.\n\nAbout two minutes before the total immersion, the remaining part of the sun was reduced to a very fine horn, whose extremities seemed to lose their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a>- Apparent Motions of the Heavenly Bodies. nes, and to become round like flares; and for the space of about a quarter of a minute a small piece of the southern horn of the eclipse seemed to be cut off from the rest by a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, and appeared like an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> star rounded at both ends; which appearance would proceed from no other cause but the inequalities of the moon's surface; there being some elevated parts thereof near the moon's southern pole, by whose interposition part of that exceedingly fine filament of light was intercepted. A few seconds before the sun was totally hid, there discovered itself round the moon a luminous ring, about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIGIT\">digit</a>, or perhaps a tenth part of the moon's diameter, in breadth. It was of a pale whiteness, or rather of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEARL\">pearl</a> colour, seeming to me a little tinged with the colour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IRIS\">iris</a>, and to be concentric with the moon; whence I concluded it the moon's atmosphere. But the great height of it, far exceeding that of our earth's atmosphere, and the observations of some who found the breadth of the ring to increase on the west side of the moon as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMERSION\">emersion</a> approached, together with the contrary sentiments of those whose judgments I shall always reverence, make me less confident, especially in a matter to which I gave not all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> requisite.\n\nWhatever it was, this ring appeared much brighter and whiter near the body of the moon than at a distance from it; and its outward circumference, which was ill defined, seemed terminated only by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> rarity of the matter of which it was composed, and in all respects resembled the appearance of an enlightened atmosphere seen from far; but whether it belonged to the sun or moon, I shall not pretend to determine. During the whole time of the total eclipse, I kept my Flashes of telescope constantly fixed on the moon, in order to observe what might occur in this uncommon appearance; and I saw perpetual flashes or coruscations of light behind the moon, now here, now there, on all sides, but more especially on the western side, a little before the emersion; and about two or three seconds before it, on the same western side, where the sun was just coming out, a long and very narrow streak of dulky but strong red light seemed to colour the dark edge of the moon, though nothing like it had been seen immediately after the emersion. But this instantly vanished after the appearance of the sun, as did also the aforesaid luminous ring.\"\n\nMr Louville relates, that a luminous ring of a silver Mr Lou- colour appeared round the moon as soon as the sun was visible; observation he recovered his sight; that this ring was brightest near the moon, and grew gradually fainter towards its outer circumference, where it was, however, defined; that it was not equally bright all over, but had several breaks in it: but he makes no doubt of its being occasioned by the moon's atmosphere, and thinks that the breaks in it were occasioned by the mountains of the moon: he says also, that this ring had the moon, and not the sun, for its centre, during the whole time of its appearance. Another proof brought by him of the moon having an atmosphere is, that, towards the end of the total darkness, there was seen on that side of the moon on which the sun was going to appear, a piece of a circle, of a lively red, which might\nApparent be owing to the red rays that are least refrangible being transmitted through the moon's atmosphere in the greatest quantity: and that he might be assured this redness did not proceed from the glasses of his telescope, he took care to bring the red part into the middle of his glasses.\n\nHe lays great stress on the streaks of light which he saw dart instantaneously from different places of the moon during the time of total darkness, but chiefly near the eastern edge of the disk; these he takes to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>, such as a spectator would see flashing from the dark hemisphere of the earth, if he were placed upon the moon, and saw the earth come between himself and the sun. \"Now (says Dr Long) it is highly probable, that if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> had, at any time, a view of that half of the earth where it is night, he would see lightning in some part of it or other.\" Louville farther observes, that the most mountainous countries are most liable to tempests; and that mountains being more frequent in the moon, and higher, than on earth*, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> and lightning must be more frequent there than with us; and that the eastern side of the moon would be most subject to thunder and lightning, those parts having been heated by the sun for half the month immediately preceding. It must here be observed, that Halley, in mentioning these flashes, says they seemed to come from behind the moon; and Louville, though he says they came sometimes from one part and sometimes from another, owns, that he himself only saw them near the eastern part of the disk; and that, not knowing at that time what it was that he saw, he did not take notice whether the same appearance was to be seen on other parts of the moon or not. He tells us, however, of an English astronomer, who presented the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> with a draught of what he saw in the moon at the time of this eclipse; from which Louville seems to conclude that lightnings had been observed by that astronomer near the centre of the moon's disk. \"Now (says Dr Long) thunder and lightning would be a demonstration of the moon having an atmosphere similar to ours, wherein vapours and exhalations may be supported, and furnish materials for clouds, storms, and tempests. But the strongest proof brought by Louville of the moon having an atmosphere is this, that as soon as the eclipse began, those parts of the sun which were going to be hid by the moon grew sensibly palish as the former came near them, suffering beforehand a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> eclipse or diminution of light; this would be owing to nothing else but the atmosphere of the moon, the eastern part whereof going before her reached the sun before the moon did. As to the great height of the lunar atmosphere, which from the breadth of the luminous ring being about a whole digit would upon a calculation come out 180 miles, above three times as high as the atmosphere of the earth, Louville thinks that no objection; since if the moon were surrounded with an atmosphere of the same nature with that which encompasses the earth, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a> thereof towards the moon would be but one third of that of our atmosphere towards the earth; and consequently its expansion would make the height of it three times as great from the moon as is the height of our atmosphere from the earth.\"\n\nThe same luminous ring has been observed in other total eclipses, and even in such as are annular, though without the luminous streaks or flashes of lightning Apparent above-mentioned; it is even taken notice of by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-PLUTARCH\">Plutarch</a>; however, some members of the academy at Paris have endeavoured to account for both these phenomena without having recourse to a lunar atmosphere; and for this purpose they made the following experiments: They placed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a> of the sun coming through a small hole in a window to a darkened room, was received upon a circle of wood otherwise or metal of a diameter a good deal larger than that of the sun's image; then the shadow of this opaque circle was cast upon white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, and there appeared round it, on the paper, a luminous circle such as that which surrounds the moon. The like experiment being made with a globe of wood, and with another of stone not polished, the shadows of both these casts upon paper were surrounded with a palish light, most vivid near the shadows, and gradually more dilated at a distance from them. They observe also, that the ring round the moon was seen in the eclipse of 1706 by Wurzelbaur, who cast her shadow upon white paper. The same appearance was observed on holding an opaque globe in the sun, so as to cover his whole body from the eye; for, looking at it through a smoked glass, in order to prevent the eye from being hurt by the glare of light it would otherwise be exposed to, the globe appeared with a light resembling that round the moon in a total eclipse of the sun.\n\nThus they solve the phenomenon of the ring seen round the moon by the inflection, or diffraction as they call it, of the solar rays passing near an opaque substance. As for the small streaks of light above-mentioned, and which are supposed to be lightning, they explain these by an hypothesis concerning the cavities of the moon themselves; which they consider as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCAVE\">concave</a> mirrors reflecting the light of the sun nearly to the same point; and as these are continually changing their situation with great velocity by the moon's motion from the sun, the light which any one of them tends to our eye is seen but for a moment. This, however, will not account for the flashes, if any such there are, seen near the centre of the disk, though it does, in no very satisfactory manner, account for those at the edges.\n\nIt has already been observed, that the occultations of Occultation fixed stars and planets by the moon, in general happenings of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> without any kind of refraction of their light by fixed stars the lunar atmosphere. The contrary, however, has by the moon sometimes been observed, and the stars have been seen manifestly to change their shape and colour on going behind the moon's disk. An instance of this happened on the 28th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> N.S. in the year 1715, when an occultation of Venus by the moon happened in the daytime. Some astronomers in France observing this with a telescope, saw Venus change colour for about a minute before she was hid by the moon; and the same change of colour was observed immediately after her emergence from behind the disk. At both times the edge of the disk of Venus that was nearest the moon appeared reddish, and that which was most distant of a bluish colour. These appearances, however, which might have been taken for proofs of a lunar atmosphere, were supposed to be owing to the observers having directed the axis of their telescopes towards the moon. This would necessarily cause any planet or star near the edge of the moon's disk to be seen through those parts of the glasses which are near their circumference,\nApparent Motions of the Heavenly Bodies.\n\nOccultation of Jupiter by the Moon\n\nMaraldi also informs us, that he had observed before this two other occultations of Venus and one of Jupiter; and was always attentive to see whether those planets changed their figure or colour either upon the approach of the moon to cover them, or at their first coming again into sight; but never could perceive any such thing. Nor could he, in a great number of occultations of the fixed stars, perceive the smallest apparent change in any of them, excepting once that a fixed star seemed to increase its distance a little from the moon as it was going to be covered by her; but this, he suspected, might be owing to his telescope being directed so as to have the star seen too far from the middle of its aperture. He concludes, therefore, that the moon has no atmosphere; and he remarks, that at Montpelier, perhaps because the air is clearer there than at London, the luminous ring round the moon appeared much larger than at London; that it was very white near the moon, and gradually decreasing in brightness, formed round her a circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of about eight degrees in diameter. If, says he, this light was caused by the atmosphere of the moon, of what a prodigious extent must that atmosphere be?\n\nWe have related all these opinions at full length, in order to put our readers in possession of the arguments that have been advanced upon this subject; but it is now generally admitted, and indeed, scarcely can be denied, that the atmosphere of the moon, if it really has any, is almost entirely insensible.\n\nFrom the spots upon the moon's disk it has been ascertained, that the same hemisphere of that luminary is always directed towards the earth. Hence it follows that the turns round her axis once during every revolution round the earth.\n\nExact observations have ascertained that slight varieties take place respecting the appearances of the moon's disk. The spots are observed alternately to approach towards and recede from the edge of the moon. Those that are very near the edge appear and disappear alternately, making periodical oscillations, which are distinguished by the name of the libration of the moon. To form a precise idea of the nature of this libration we must consider that the disk of the moon, seen from the centre of the earth, is terminated by the circumference of a great circle of the moon, perpendicular to a line drawn from the earth's centre to that of the moon. The lunar hemisphere is projected upon the plane of this circle turned towards the earth, and its appearances are due to the movements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> of that body relative to its radius vector. If the moon did not revolve round her axis, this radius vector would describe a great circle on the moon's surface, all the points of which would present themselves successively to us. But the moon, revolving in the same time that this radius vector describes the great circle, always keeps the same point of the circle nearly upon the radius, and of course the same hemisphere turned towards the earth. The inequalities of her motion produce the flight variations in her appearance; for the rotation Apparent Motions of the moon does not partake sensibly of these irregularities. Hence it varies somewhat relatively to the radius vector, which accordingly cuts successively different points of the surface. Of course the globe of the moon makes oscillations relatively to that radius corresponding to the inequalities of her motions, which alternately conceal from our view and discover to us some parts of her surface.\n\nFarther: the axis of rotation of the moon is not exactly perpendicular to the plane of her orbit. If we suppose the position of this axis fixed, during a revolution of the moon, it inclines more or less to the radius vector, so that the angle formed by these two lines is acute during one part of her revolution, and obtuse during another part of it. Hence the poles of rotation are alternately visible from the earth, and those parts of her surface that are near these poles.\n\nBesides all this, the observer is not placed at the centre of the earth, but at its surface. It is the radius drawn from his eye to the centre of the moon, which determines the middle point of her visible hemisphere. But in consequence of the lunar parallax, it is obvious that this radius must cut the surface of the moon in points sensibly different according to the height of that luminary above the horizon. All these causes concur to produce the libration of the moon, a phenomenon which is merely optical, and not connected with her rotation, which relatively to us is perfectly equable; or at least if it be subjected to any irregularities, they are too small to be observed.\n\nThis is not the case with the variations in the plane Theory of the moon's equator. While endeavouring to determine its position by the lunar spots, Cassini was led to this remarkable conclusion, which includes the whole astronomical theory of the real libration of that luminary. Conceive a plane passing through the centre of the moon perpendicular to her axis of rotation, and of course coinciding with the plane of her equator; conceive a second plane, parallel to the ecliptic, to pass through the same centre; and also a third plane, which is the mean plane of the lunar orbit: these three planes have a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERSECTION\">intersection</a>; the second, placed between the two others, forms with the first an angle of $10^\\circ 50'$, and with the third an angle of $5^\\circ 14'69''$; therefore the intersections of the lunar equator with the ecliptic coincide always with the mean nodes of the lunar orbit, and like them have a retrograde motion, which is completed in the period of 6793.3009 days. During that interval the two poles of the equator and lunar orbit describe small circles parallel to the ecliptic, enclosing between them the pole of the ecliptic, so that these three poles are constantly upon a great circle of the heavenly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a>.\n\nChap. III. Of the Planets.\n\nAmidst the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> variety of stars which occupy a place in the sphere of the heavens, and which occupy nearly the same relative position with respect to each other, there are eight which may be observed to move in a very complicated manner, but following certain precise laws, for they always commence the same motions again after every period. The motions of these\nApparent these stars, called planets, constitute one of the principal objects of astronomy. These planets are called\n\n1. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a>.\n2. Venus.\n3. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a>.\n4. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CERES\">Ceres</a>.\n5. Pallas.\n6. Jupiter.\n7. Saturn.\n8. Herschel.\n\nMercury and Venus never separate from the sun farther than certain limits; the rest separate to all the possible angular distances. The movements of all these bodies are included in a zone of the heavenly sphere called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZODIAC\">zodiac</a>. This zone is divided into two equal parts by the ecliptic. Its breadth was formerly considered as only about $16^\\circ$; but it must be much increased if the orbits of Ceres and Pallas, the two newly discovered planets, are to be comprehended in it. It will be proper to consider the motions and appearances of each of these planets. This will be the subject of the following sections.\n\n**Sect. I. Of Mercury.**\n\nMercury is a small star, but emits a very bright white light: though, by reason of his always keeping near the sun, he is seldom to be seen; and when he does make his appearance, his motion towards the sun is so swift, that he can only be discerned for a short time. He appears a little after sunset, and again a little before sunrise.\n\nMercury never goes to a greater distance from the sun than about $27^\\circ 5'$; so that he is never longer in setting after the sun than an hour and 50 minutes; nor does he ever rise sooner than 1 hour and 50 minutes before that luminary. Very frequently, he goes so near the sun as to be lost altogether in his rays. When he begins to make his appearance in the evening after sunset, he can scarcely at first be distinguished in the rays of the twilight. But the planet disengages itself more and more, and is seen at a greater distance from the sun every successive evening; and having got to the distance of about $22^\\circ 5'$, it begins to return again. During this interval, the motion of Mercury referred to the stars is direct; but when it approaches within $18^\\circ$ of the sun it appears for some time <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>; and then its motion begins to be retrograde. The planet continues to approach the sun, and at last plunges into his rays in the evening, and disappears. Soon after, it may be perceived in the morning, before sunrise, separating farther and farther from the sun, his motion being retrograde, as before he disappeared. At the distance of $18^\\circ$ it becomes stationary, and assumes a direct motion, continuing, however, to separate till it comes to $22^\\circ 5'$ of distance; then it returns again to the sun, plunges into his rays, and appears soon after in the evening, after sunset, to repeat the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>. The angular distance from the sun, which the planet reaches on both sides of that luminary, varies from $16^\\circ$ to nearly $28^\\circ$.\n\nThe duration of a complete oscillation, or the interval of time that elapses before the planet returns again to the point from which it set out, varies also from 100 to 130 days. The mean arc of his retrogradation is about $13^\\circ 10'$; its mean duration 23 days. But the quantity differs greatly in different retrogradations. In general, the laws of the movements of Mercury are very complicated; he does not move exactly in the plane of the ecliptic; sometimes he deviates from it more than $5^\\circ$.\n\nSome considerable time must have elapsed before astronomers suspected that the stars which were seen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> the sun in the evening and in the morning were one and the same. The circumstance, however, of the one never being seen at the same time with the other would gradually lead them to the right conclusion.\n\nThe apparent diameter of Mercury varies as well as that of the sun and moon, and this variation is obviously connected with his position relatively to the sun, and with the direction of his movement. The diameter is at its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINIMUM\">minimum</a> when the planet plunges into the solar rays in the morning, or when it disengages itself from them; it is at its maximum when the planet plunges into the solar rays in the evening, or when it disengages itself from them in the evening; that is to say, when the planet passes the sun in its retrograde motion, its diameter is the greatest possible; when it passes the sun in its direct motion, it is the smallest possible;\u2014and the mean length of the apparent diameter of Mercury is $11''$.\n\nSometimes, when the planet disappears during its retrograde motion, that is to say, when it plunges into the sun's rays in the evening, it may be seen crossing the sun under the form of a black spot, which describes a chord along the disk of the sun. This black spot is recognized to be the planet by its position, its apparent diameter, and its retrograde motion. These transits of Mercury, as they are termed, are real annular eclipses of the sun: they demonstrate that the planet is an opaque body, and that it borrows its light from the sun. When examined by means of telescopes magnifying about 200 or 300 times, he appears equally luminous throughout his whole surface, without the least dark spot. But he exhibits the same difference of phases with the moon, being sometimes horned, sometimes gibbous, and sometimes shining almost with a round face, though not entirely full, because his enlightened side is never turned directly towards us; but at all times perfectly well defined without any ragged edge, and perfectly bright. Like the moon, the crescent is always turned towards the sun. These different phases throw considerable light on the orbit of Mercury.\n\n**Sect. II. Of Venus.**\n\nVenus, the most beautiful star in the heavens, known by the names of the morning and evening star, likewise keeps near the sun, though he recedes from him almost double the distance of Mercury. She is never seen in the eastern quarter of the heavens when the sun is in the western; but always seems to attend him in the evening, or to give notice of his approach in the morning.\n\nThe planet Venus presents the same phenomena with Mercury; but her different phases are much more sensible, her oscillations wider, and of longer duration. Her greatest distance from the sun varies from $45^\\circ$ to nearly $48^\\circ$, and the mean duration of a complete oscillation is 584 days.\n\nVenus has been sometimes seen moving across the sun's disk in the form of a round black spot, with an apparent diameter of about $59''$. A few days after this has been observed, Venus is seen in the morning,\nApparent west of the sun, in the form of a fine crescent, with the convexity turned toward the sun. She moves gradually westward with a retarded motion, and the crescent becomes more full. In about ten weeks she has moved 46\u00b0 west of the sun, and is now a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a>, and her diameter is 26\u00b0. She is now stationary. She then moves eastward with a motion gradually accelerated, and overtakes the sun about 9\u00bd months after having been seen on his disk. Some time after, she is seen in the evening, east of the sun, round, but very small. She moves eastward, and increases in diameter, but loses of her roundness, till she gets about 46\u00b0 east of the sun, when she is again a semicircle. She now moves westward, increasing in diameter, but becoming a crescent like the waning moon; and, at last, after a period of nearly 584 days, comes again into conjunction with the sun with an apparent diameter of 5\u00b0.\n\nThe mean arc of her retrogradation is about 16\u00b0, and its mean duration is 42 days. She does not move exactly in the plane of the ecliptic, but deviates from it several degrees. Like Mercury, she sometimes crosses the sun's disk. The duration of these transits, as observed from different parts of the earth's surface, are very different: this is owing to the parallax of Venus, in consequence of which different observers refer to different parts of the sun's disk, and see her describe different chords on that disk. In the transit which happened in 1769, the difference of its duration, as observed at Otaheite and at Wardhuyss in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAPLAND\">Lapland</a>, amounted to 23 m. 10 sec. This difference gives us the parallax of Venus, and of course her distance from the earth during a conjunction. The knowledge of this parallax enables us, by a method to be afterwards described, to ascertain that of the sun, and consequently to discover its distance from the earth.\n\nThe great variations of the apparent diameter of Venus demonstrate that her distance from the earth is exceedingly variable. It is largest when the planet passes over the surface of the sun. Her mean apparent diameter is 58\u00b0.\n\nFrom the movement of certain spots upon the surface of Venus, it has been concluded that she revolves round her axis once in 24 hours; but this requires to be corrected by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> observations. It is extremely difficult to perceive or examine these spots in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>. The subject merits the attention of astronomers farther to the south, in more favourable circumstances. The following detail will show the uncertainty which has prevailed among astronomers respecting these spots.\n\nDr Long informs us, that the earliest account he had met with of any spots seen by means of the telescope on the disk of Venus was in a collection of letters printed at Paris in 1665, in one of which Mr Auzout relates his having received advice from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a> that Mr Burratini had, by means of large telescopes, seen spots upon the planet Venus similar to those upon the moon. In 1667, Cassini, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Mr Petit, mentions his having for a long time carefully observed Venus through an excellent telescope made by Campagni, in order to know whether that planet revolved on its axis or not, as he had before found Jupiter and Mars to do. But though he then observed some spots upon her, he says, that even when the air was quiet and clear, they appeared faint, irregular, and not well defined; so that it was difficult to have such a distinct view of any of them as to be certain that it was the same spot which was seen again in any subsequent observation; and this difficulty was increased, in the first place, when Venus was in her inferior semicircle; because at that time the sun must be viewed through the thick vapours near the horizon; though otherwise it was most proper, on account of her being then nearest to us. In the second place, if we would observe her at some height above those vapours, it could only be for a short time; and thirdly, when she is low in her inferior circle, and at that time nearest the earth, the enlightened part of her is too small to discover any motion in it. He was therefore of opinion, that he should succeed better in his observations when the planet was about its mean distance from us, showing about one half of her enlightened hemisphere; at which time also he could observe her for a much longer time above the grols atmospheric vapours. His first appearance of success was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a> 14, 1666, at three quarters past five in the evening; when he saw a bright spot (fig. 37.), but could not then view that spot long enough to draw any inference concerning the planet's motion. He had no farther success till the 20th of April the following year; when, about a quarter of an hour before sunrise, he began again to perceive on the disk of Venus, now about half enlightened, a bright part near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>, distant from the southern horn a little more than a fourth part of the diameter of the disk, and near the eastern edge. He took notice also of a darkish oblong spot nearer to the northern than the southern horn: at sunrise the bright part was advanced farther from the southern horn than when he first observed it; but though he was pleased to find that he had now a convincing proof of the planet's motion, he was surprised that the spots moved from south to north in the spots near lower part of the disk, and from north to south in the upper part; a kind of motion of which we have no example except in the librations of the moon. This, however, was occasioned by the situation of the planet's axis. Cassini expected to have found the rotation of Venus similar to that of Jupiter and Mars, both of which have their axis perpendicular to their respective orbits, and turn round according to the order of the signs; so that in each of them the motion of the inferior half of their respective globes, or that part next the sun, is from east to west; in the superior half from west to east; but in Venus, whose axis is inclined 75 degrees towards her orbit, the coincidence is so near, that one half of her disk appears to move from south to north, the other from north to south.\n\nOn the 21st of April, at sunrise, the bright part was a good way off the section, and about a fourth part of the diameter distant from the southern horn; the appearance of the When the sun was eight degrees six minutes high, it seemed to be got beyond the centre, and was cut off through by the section. At the time the sun was feet times seven degrees high, the section cut it in the middle, which showed its motion to have some inclination towards the centre.\n\nMay 9, a little before sunrise, the bright spot was seen near the centre, a little to the northward, with two obscure ones situated between the section and the circumference, at a distance from each other, equal to that\nPart II.\n\nApparent that of each of them from the nearest angular point or horn of the planet. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> being at that time clear, he observed for an hour and half a quarter the motion of the bright spot, which seemed to be exactly from south to north, without any sensible declination to east or west. A variation was at the same time perceived in the darkish spot too great to be ascribed to any optical cause. The bright spot was also seen on the 10th and 13th days of May before sunrise between the northern horn and the centre, and the same irregular change of darkish spots was taken notice of; but as the planet removed to a greater distance from the earth, it became more difficult to observe these appearances. The above phenomena are represented as they occurred, in fig. 19 to 25.\n\nBut though, from the appearances just now related, Mr. Cassini was of opinion that Venus revolved on her axis, he was by no means so positive in this matter as with regard to Mars and Jupiter. \"The spots on these (says he) I could attentively observe for a whole night, when the planets were in opposition to the sun: I could see them return to the same situation, and consider their motion during some hours, and judge whether they were the same spots or not, and what time they took in turning round: but it was not the same with the spots of Venus; for they can be observed only for so short a time, that it is much more difficult to know with certainty when they return into the same situation. I can, however, supposing that the bright spot which I observed on Venus, and particularly this year, was the same, say that she finishes her motion, whether of rotation or libration, in less than a day; so that, in 23 days nearly, the spot comes into the same situation on nearly the same hour of the day, though not without some irregularity. Now (supposing the bright spot observed to be always the same) whether this motion is an entire turning round, or only a libration, is what I dare not positively affirm.\"\n\nIn 1669, Mr. Cassini again observed Venus through a telescope, but could not then perceive any spots upon her surface; the reason of which Dr. Hamel conjectures to have been the fluctuation of the vapours near the horizon, which prevented them from being visible. However, we hear nothing more of any spots being seen on her disk till the year 1726; when, on the 9th of February, Bianchini, with some of Campi's telescopes of 92 and 100 Roman palms, began to observe the planet at the altitude of 40\u00b0 above the horizon, and continued his observation till, by the motion of several spots, he determined the position of her axis to be inclined as above-mentioned, that the north pole pointed at a circle of latitude drawn through the 20th degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AQUARIUS\">Aquarius</a>, elevated 15\u00b0 or 20\u00b0 above the orbit of Venus. He delineated also the figures of several spots which he supposed to be seas, and complimented the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a> and some other great men by calling them by their names. Though none of Bianchini's observations were continued long enough to know whether the spots, at the end of the period assigned for the rotation of the planet, would have been in a different situation from what they were at the beginning of it; yet, from observations of two and four days, he concluded the motion of the spots to be at the rate of 15\u00b0 per day; at which advance the planet must turn round either once in 24 days or in 23 hours; but without farther observation it could not be determined which of the two was the period of Motions of revolution; for if an observer should at a particular hour suppose seven in the evening, mark exactly the place of a spot, and at the same hour next evening find the spot advanced 15\u00b0, he would not be able to determine whether the spot had advanced only 15\u00b0, or concerning had gone once quite round with the addition of 1\u00b0, or takes more in part of another rotation. Mr. Bianchini, however, supposes Venus to revolve in 24 days eight ving round hours; the principal proof adduced for which is another axis, observation of three spots, ABC, being situated as in fig. 26, when they were viewed by himself and several persons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> for about an hour, during which they could not perceive any change of place. The planet being then hid behind the Barbarini <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, they could not have another view of her till three hours after, when the spots still appeared unmoved. \"Now (says Mr. Bianchini) if her rotation were so swift as to go round in 23 hours, in this second view, three hours after the former, the spots must have advanced near 50 degrees; so that the spot C would have been gone off at R, the spot B would have succeeded into the place of C, the spot A into the place of B, and there would have been no more but two spots, A and B, to have been seen.\"\n\nCassini, the son, in a memoir for 1732, denies the Difficulties attending these observations conclusion of Bianchini to be certain. He says, that between Cassini and Bianchini, the spot C might have been gone off the disk, and the spot B got into the place thereof, where, being near the edge, it would appear less than in the middle. That A, succeeding into the place of B, would appear larger than it had done near the edge, and that another spot might come into the place of A; and there were other spots besides these three on the globe of the planet, as appears by the figures of Bianchini himself, particularly one which would naturally come in the place of A. That if the rotation of Venus be supposed to be in 23 hours, it will agree with Bianchini's observations, as well as with those of his father; but that, on the other supposition, the latter must be entirely rejected as erroneous: and he concludes with telling us, that Venus had frequently been observed in the most favourable times by Mr. Maraldi and himself with excellent telescopes of 80 and 100 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a>, without their being able to see any distinct spot upon her disk. \"Perhaps (says Dr Long) those seen by Bianchini had disappeared, or the air in France was not clear enough; which last might be the reason why his father could never see those spots in France which he had observed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, even when he made use of the longest telescopes.\" Neither of these astronomers take notice of any indentings in the curve which divides the illuminated part from the dark in the disk of Venus, though in some views of that planet by Fontana and Riccioli, the curve is indented; and it has from thence been concluded, that the surface of the planet is mountainous like that of the moon. This had also been supposed by Burattini, already mentioned; and a late writer has observed, that, \"when the air is in a good state for observation, mountains like those of the moon may be observed with a very powerful telescope.\"\n\nCassini, besides the discovery of the spots on the disk of Venus by which he was enabled to ascertain her revolution satellites.\nAstronomy.\n\nApparent Motions of the Heavenly Bodies.\n\nA.D. 1686, August 28th, at 15 minutes after four in the morning, looking at Venus with a telescope of 34 feet, I saw, at the distance of one-third of her diameter eastward, a luminous appearance, of a shape not well defined, that seemed to have the same phase with Venus, which was then gibbous on the western side. The diameter of this phenomenon was nearly equal to a fourth part of the diameter of Venus. I observed it attentively for a quarter of an hour, and having left off looking at it for four or five minutes, I saw it no more; but daylight was then advanced. I had seen a like phenomenon which resembled the phase of Venus, Jan. 25th, A.D. 1672, from 52 minutes after six in the morning to two minutes after seven, when the brightness of the twilight made it disappear. Venus was then horned; and this phenomenon, the diameter whereof was nearly a fourth part of the diameter of Venus, was of the same shape. It was distant from the southern horn of Venus, a diameter of the planet, on the western side. In these two observations, I was in doubt whether it was not a satellite of Venus of such a confidence as not to be very well fitted to reflect the light of the sun; and which, in magnitude, bore nearly the same proportion to Venus as the moon does to the earth, being at the same distance from the sun and the earth as Venus was, the phases whereof it resembled. Notwithstanding all the pains I took in looking for it after these two observations, and at divers other times, in order to complete so considerable a discovery, I was never able to see it. I therefore suspended my judgment of this phenomenon. If it should return often, there will be these two epochs, which, compared with other observations, may be of use to find out the periodical time of its return, if it can be reduced to any rule.\"\n\nA similar observation was made by Mr Short on the 23rd of October 1740, about sunrise. He used at this time a reflecting telescope of about 16.5 inches, which magnified between 50 and 60 times, with which he perceived a small star at about 10' distance from Venus, as measured by the micrometer; and, putting on a magnifying power of 240 times, he found the star put on the same appearance with the planet herself. Its diameter was somewhat less than a third of that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a>, but its light was less vivid, though exceedingly sharp and well defined. The same appearance continued with a magnifying power of 140 times. A line, passing through the centre of Venus and it made an angle of 18 or 20 degrees with the equator: he saw it several times that morning for about the space of an hour, after which he lost sight of it, and could never find it again.\n\nFrom this time the satellite of Venus, though very frequently looked for by astronomers, could never be perceived, which made it generally believed that Cassini and Mr Short had been mistaken; but as the transits of the planet over the sun in 1761 and 1769 seemed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> a greater certainty of finding it, the satellite was very carefully looked for by almost every one who had an opportunity of seeing the transit, but generally without success. Mr Baudouin at Paris had provided a telescope of 25 feet, in order to observe the passage of the planet over the sun, and to look for its satellite; but he did not succeed either at that time or in the months of April and May following. Mr Montaigne, however, one of the members of the Society of the Heavens, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LIMOGES\">Limoges</a>, had better success. On the 3rd of May 1761, he perceived, about half an hour after nine at night, at the distance of 2' from Venus, a small crescent seen by Mr Montaigne of the planet; the diameter of the former being about at the transit one-fourth of that of the latter; and a line drawn from Venus to the satellite making an angle with the vertical of about 20\u00b0 towards the south. But though he repeated this observation several times, some doubt remained whether it was not a small star. Next day he saw the same star at the same hour, distant from Venus about half a minute, or a minute more than before, and making with the vertical an angle of 10\u00b0 below on the north side; so that the satellite seemed to have described an arc of about 30\u00b0, whereof Venus was the centre, and the radius 20'. The two following nights were hazy, so that Venus could only be seen; but on the 7th of May, at the same hour as before, he saw the satellite again above Venus, and on the north side, at the distance of 25' or 26' upon a line which made an angle of about 45\u00b0 with the vertical towards the right hand. The light of the satellite was always very weak, but it had the same phases with its primary, whether viewed together with it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of his telescope or by itself. The telescope was nine feet long, and magnified an object between 40 and 50 times, but had no micrometer; so that the distances above-mentioned are only from estimation.\n\nFig. 27 represents the three observations of Mr Montaigne. V is the planet Venus; ZN the vertical. EC, a parallel to the ecliptic, making them an angle with the vertical of 45\u00b0; the numbers 3, 4, 7, mark the situations of the satellite on the respective days. From the figure it appears that the points 3 and 7 would have been diametrically opposite, had the satellite gone 15\u00b0 more round the point V at the last observation; so that in four days it went through 155\u00b0. Then, as 155\u00b0 is to four days or 96 hours, so is 360\u00b0 to a fourth number, which gives 9 days 7 hours for the whole length of the synodical revolution. Hence Mr Baudouin concluded, that the distance of this satellite was about 60 of the semidiameters of Venus from its surface; that its orbit cut the ecliptic nearly at right angles; had its ascending node in 22\u00b0 of Virgo; and was in its greatest northern digression on the 7th at nine at night; and he supposed that at the transit of the primary the satellite would be seen accompanying it. By a subsequent observation, however, on the 11th of May, he corrected his calculation of the periodical time of the satellite, which he now enlarged to 12 days; in consequence of which he found that it would not pass over the disk of the sun along with its primary, but go at the distance of above 20' from his southern limb; though if the time of its revolution should be 15 hours longer than 12 days, it might then pass over the sun after Venus was gone off. He imagined the reason why this satellite was so difficult to be observed might be, that one part of its globe was covered over with spots, or otherwise unfit to reflect the light of the sun. By comparing the periodical time of this satellite with that of our moon, he computed the quantity of matter in Venus to be nearly equal...\nequal to that in our earth; in which case it must have considerable influence in changing the obliquity of the ecliptic, the latitudes and longitudes of stars, &c.\n\nIt is now known that this supposed satellite of Cassini was merely an optical deception.\n\nIn the Philosophical Transactions for 1761, Mr Hirst gives an account of his having observed an atmosphere round the planet Venus. The observations were made at Fort St George; and looking attentively at that part of the sun's disk where he expected the planet would enter, he plainly perceived a faint shade or penumbra; on which he called out to his two assistants, \"It is a coming!\" and two or three seconds after, the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> contact took place, in the moment whereof all the three agreed; but he could not see the penumbra after the egrets; and of the other two gentlemen, one had gone home, and the other lost the planet out of the field of his telescope. Mr Dunn at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHELSEA\">Chelsea</a> saw a penumbra, or small diminution of light, that grew darker and darker for about five seconds before the internal contact preceding the egrets; from whence he determines that Venus is surrounded with an atmosphere of about 50 geographical miles high. His observations, he tells us, were made with an excellent six-feet Newtonian reflector, with a magnifying power of 110, and of 220 times; he had a clear dark glass next his eye, and the sun's limb appeared well defined; but a very narrow watery penumbra appeared round Venus. The darkest part of the planet's phase was at the distance of about a fifth part of her diameter from its edge; from which an imperfect light increased to the centre, and illuminated round about.\n\nIn the northern parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> this penumbra could not be seen. Mr Wargentin, who communicated several observations of the first external contact, says, that he could not mark the time exactly, because of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNDULATION\">undulation</a> of the limb of the sun; but thought it very remarkable that, at the egrets, the limb of Venus that was gone off the sun showed itself with a faint light during almost the whole time of emergence. Mr Bergman, who was then at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">observatory</a> at Upsal, begins his account at the time when three-fourths of the disk of the planet was entered upon that of the sun; and he says, that the part which was not come upon the sun was visible, though dark, and surrounded by a crescent of faint light, as in fig. 28.; but this appearance was much more remarkable at the egrets; for as soon as any part of the planet was got off the sun, that part was visible with a like crescent, but brighter, fig. 29. As more of the planetary disk went off that of the sun, however, that part of the crescent which was farthest from the sun grew fainter, and vanished, until at last only the horns could be seen, as in fig. 30. The total ingrefts was not instantaneous: but, as two drops of water, when about to part, form a ligament between them; so there was a dark swelling stretched out between Venus and the sun, as in fig. 31.; and when this ligament broke, the planet appeared to have got about an eighth part of her diameter from the nearest limb of the sun, fig. 32.: he saw the like appearance at going off, but not so distinct, fig. 33. Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHAPPE\">Chappe</a> likewise took notice, that the part of Venus which was not upon the sun was visible during part of the time of ingrefts and egrets; that it was farther surrounded by a small luminous ring of a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> near the place that appeared in the form of a crescent, which was much brighter at the going off than coming upon the sun; and that, during the whole time the disk of Venus was upon the sun, he saw nothing of it. The time of total ingrefts was instantaneous like a flash of lightning; but at the egrets the limb of the sun began to be obscured three seconds before the interior contact. Some of the French astronomers attributed this luminous ring round Venus to the inflection of the sun's rays, as they also do the light seen round the moon in solar eclipses; but Mr Chappe supposes it to have been owing to the sun enlightening more than one half of the planetary globe, though he owns this cause not to be altogether sufficient. Mr Fouchy, who observed the transit at La Muette in France, perceived, during the whole time, a kind of ring round Venus, brighter than the rest of the sun, which became fainter the farther it went from the planet, but appeared more vivid in proportion as the sun was clearer. Mr Ferrer, who observed at the same place, confirms the testimony of Mr Fouchy.\n\n\"During the whole time (says he) of my observing with the telescope, and the blue and green glares, I perceived a light round about Venus, which followed her like a luminous atmosphere more or less lively, according as the air was more or less clear. Its extent altered in the same manner; nor was it well terminated, throwing out, as it were, some feeble rays on all sides.\"\n\n\"I am not clear (says Dr Long) as to the mean. Dr Long's opinion on the whole planet was upon the sun, they saw a ring of light round it, distinct from the light of the sun; or whether they mean only the light which surrounded that part of Venus that was not upon the sun.\" Mr Chappe takes this and other accounts of the observations made in France in this latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>; and though he sometimes called the luminous part of the crescent that surrounded the part of the planet not upon the sun a ring, he explains himself that he did so, because at the coming upon the sun he perceived it at one side of the planet, and on the opposite side on its going off: for which reason he supposed that it surrounded it on all sides. See figs. 34., 35.\n\nSect. III. Of Mars.\n\nThe two planets which we have just described, appear to accompany the sun like satellites, and their mean motion round the earth is the same with that luminary. The remaining planets go to all the possible angular distances from the sun. But their motions have obviously a connection with the sun's position.\n\nMars is of a red fiery colour, and always gives a much duller light than Venus, though sometimes he equals her in size. He is not subject to the same limitation in his motions as Mercury or Venus; but appears sometimes very near the sun, and sometimes at a great distance from him; sometimes rising when the sun sets, or setting when he rises. Of this planet it is remarkable, that when he approaches any of the fixed stars, which all the planets frequently do, these stars change their colour, grow dim, and often become totally invisible, though at some little distance from the body of the planet: but Dr Herschel thinks this has been exaggerated by former astronomers.\nMars appears to move from west to east round the earth. The mean duration of his sidereal revolution is $686,979,579$ days. His motion is very unequal.\n\nWhen we begin to perceive this planet in the morning when he begins to separate from the sun, his motion is direct and the most rapid possible. This rapidity diminishes gradually, and the motion ceases altogether when the planet is about $137^\\circ$ distant from the sun; then his motion becomes retrograde, and increases in rapidity till he comes into opposition with the sun. It then gradually diminishes again, and becomes nothing when Mars approaches within $137^\\circ$ of the sun. Then the motion becomes direct after having been retrograde for $73$ days, during which interval the planet describes an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of about $16^\\circ$. Continuing to approach the sun, the planet at last is lost in the evening in the rays of that luminary. All these different phenomena are renewed after every opposition of Mars; but there are considerable differences both in the extent and duration of his retrogradations.\n\nMars does not move exactly in the plane of the ecliptic, but deviates from it several degrees. His apparent diameter varies exceedingly. His mean apparent diameter is $27''$, and it increases so much, that when the planet is in opposition, the apparent diameter is $81''$. Then the parallax of Mars becomes sensible, and about double that of the sun.\n\nThe disk of Mars changes its form relatively to its position with regard to the sun, and becomes oval. Its phases show that it derives its light from that luminary. The spots observed on its surface have informed astronomers that it moves round its axis from west to east in $1,027,333$ days, and its axis is inclined to the ecliptic at an angle of about $59.7^\\circ$.\n\nSpots when first seen on Mars. They were first observed in 1666 by Cassini at Bologna with a telescope of Campani about $16\\frac{1}{2}$ feet long; and continuing to observe them for a month, he found they came into the same situation in $24$ hours and $40$ minutes. The planet was observed by some astronomers at Rome with longer telescopes made by Lutfachio Divini; but they assigned to it a rotation in $13$ hours only. This, however, was afterwards shown by Mr Cassini to have been a mistake, and to have arisen from their not distinguishing the opposite sides of the planet, which it seems have spots pretty much alike. He made further observations on the spots of this planet in $1670$; from whence he drew an additional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of the time the planet took to revolve. The spots were again observed in subsequent oppositions; particularly for several days in $1704$ by Maraldi, who took notice that they were not always well defined, and that they not only changed their shape frequently in the space between two oppositions, but even in the space of a month. Some of them, however, continued of the same form long enough to ascertain the time of the planet's revolution. Among these there appeared this year an oblong spot, resembling one of the belts of Jupiter when broken. It did not reach quite round the body of the planet; but had, not far from the middle of it, a small protuberance towards the north, so well defined that he was thereby enabled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> the period of its revolution at $24$ hours $39$ minutes; only one minute less than what Cassini had determined it to be. See fig. $45$.\n\nThe near approach of Mars to the earth in $1719$, gave a much better opportunity of viewing him than had been obtained before; as he was then within $23^\\circ$ of his perihelion, and at the same time the opposition to the sun. His apparent magnitude and brightness were thus so much increased, that he was by the vulgar taken for a new star. His appearance at that time, as seen by Maraldi through a telescope of $34$ feet long, is represented fig. $37$. There was then a long belt that reached half way round, to the end of which another shorter belt was joined, forming an obtuse angle with the former, as in fig. $38$. This angular point was observed on the $16$th and $20$th of August, at $11$ hours $15$ minutes, a little east of the middle of the disk; and $37$ days after, on the $25$th and $26$th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>, returned to the same situation. This interval, divided by $56$, the number of revolutions contained in it gives $24$ hours $40$ minutes for the period of one revolution; which was verified by another spot of a triangular shape, one angle whereof was towards the north pole, and the base towards the south, which on the $5$th and $6$th of August appeared as in fig. $39$, and after $72$ revolutions returned to the same situation on the $16$th and $17$th of October. The appearances of Mars, as delineated by Mr Hook, when viewed through a $36$ feet telescope, are represented fig. $40$. He appeared through this instrument as big as the full moon. Some of the belts of this planet are said to be parallel to his equator; but that seen by Maraldi was very much inclined to it.\n\nBesides these dark spots, former astronomers took notice that a segment of his globe about the south pole exceeded the rest of his disk so much in brightness, that it appeared beyond them as if it were the segment of a larger globe. Maraldi informs us, that this bright spot had been taken notice of for $60$ years, and was more permanent than the other spots on the planet. One part of it is brighter than the rest, and the least bright part is subject to great changes, and has sometimes disappeared.\n\nA similar brightness about the north pole of Mars was also sometimes observed; and these observations are now confirmed by Dr Herschel, who has viewed the planet with much better instruments, and much higher magnifying powers, than any other astronomer ever was in possession of. His observations were made Dr Herschel with a view to determine the figure of the planet, the position of his axis, &c. A very particular account of them is given in the $74$th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Philosophical Transactions, but which our limits will not allow us to insert. Fig. $41$ to $64$, show the particular appearances of Mars, as viewed on the days there marked. The magnifying powers he used were sometimes as high as $932$; and with this the fourth polar spot was found to be in diameter $41''$. Fig. $65$ shows the connection of the other figures marked $56$, $57$, $58$, $59$, $60$, $61$, $62$, which complete the whole equatorial succession of spots on the disk of the planet. The centre of the circle marked $57$ is placed on the circumference of the inner circle, by making its distance from the circle marked $59$ answer to the interval of time between the two observations, properly calculated and reduced to sidereal measure. The same is done with regard to the circles marked $58$, $59$, &c., and it will be found by placing any one of these connected circles in such a manner as to have its contents in a similar situation with the figures.\nApparent figures in the single representation, which bears the same number, that there is a sufficient resemblance between them; though some allowance must undoubtedly be made for the distortions occasioned by this kind of projection.\n\nWith regard to the bright spots themselves, Dr Herschel informs us, that the poles of the planets are not exactly in the middle of them, though nearly so.\n\n\"From the appearance and disappearance (says he) of the bright north polar spot in the year 1781, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> that the circle of its motion was at some considerable distance from the pole. By calculation, its latitude must have been about 76 or 77\u00b0 north; for I find that, to the inhabitants of Mars, the declination of the sun, June 25th, 12 h. 15 m. of our time was about 9\u00b0 56' south; and the spot must have been far removed from the north pole as to fill a few degrees within the enlightened part of the disk to become visible to us. The south pole of Mars could not be many degrees from the centre of the large bright southern spot of the year 1781; though this spot was of such a magnitude as to cover all the polar regions farther than the 70th or 65th degree; and in that part which was on the meridian, July 3d, at 10 h. 54 minutes, perhaps a little farther.\n\n\"From the appearances of the south polar spot in 1781, we may conclude that its centre was nearly polar. We find it continued visible all the time Mars revolved on his axis; and to present us generally with a pretty equal share of the luminous appearance, a spot which covered from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 of a great circle on the globe of the planet, could not have any considerable polar distance. From the observations and calculations made concerning the poles of Mars, we may conclude, that his north pole must be directed towards some point of the heavens, between 9\u00b0 24' 35' and 8\u00b0 7\u00b0 15'; because the change of the situation of the pole from left to right, which happened in the time the planet passed from one place to the other, is a plain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> of its having gone through the node of its axis. Next, we may also conclude, that the node must be considerably nearer the latter point of the ecliptic than the former; for whatever be the inclination of the axis, it will be seen under equal angles at equal distances from the node. But by a trigonometrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of solving a few triangles, we soon discovered both the inclination of the axis, and the place where it intersects the ecliptic at rectangles (which, for want of a better <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, I have perhaps improperly called its node.) Accordingly I find by calculation, that the node is in 17\u00b0 47' of Pisces, the north pole of Mars being directed towards that part of the heavens; and that the inclination of the axis to the ecliptic is 50\u00b0 40'. By further calculations we find that the pole of Mars on the 17th of April 1777, was then actually 81\u00b0 27' inclined to the ecliptic, and pointed towards the left as seen from the sun.\n\n\"The inclination and situation of the node of the axis of Mars, with respect to the ecliptic, being found, may be thus reduced to the orbit of the planet himself. Let EC (fig. 66.) be a part of the ecliptic, OM part of the orbit of Mars, PEO a line drawn from P, the celestial pole of Mars, through E, that point which has been determined to be the place of the node of the axis of Mars in the ecliptic; and continued to O, where it intersects his orbit. Now, if, according to M. de la Lande, we put the node of the orbit of Mars for 1783 in 1\u00b0 17' 58', we have from the place of the node of the axis, that is, 11\u00b0 17' 47' to the place of the node of the orbit, an arch EN of 60\u00b0 11'. In the triangle NEO, right-angled at E, there is also given the angle ENO, according to the same author, 1\u00b0 51', which is the inclination of the orbit of Mars to the ecliptic. Hence we find the angle EON 89\u00b0 5', and the side ON 60\u00b0 12'. Again, when Mars is in the node of its orbit N, we have by calculation the angle PNR=63\u00b0 7'; to which adding the angle ENO=1\u00b0 51', we have PNO=64\u00b0 58'; from which two angles, PON and PNO, with the distance ON, we obtain the inclination of the axis of Mars, and place of its node with respect to its own orbit; the inclination being 61\u00b0 18', and the place of the node of the axis 58\u00b0 31' preceding the intersection of the ecliptic with the orbit of Mars, or in our 10\u00b0 28' of Pl\u00e9cs.\"\n\nOur author next proceeds to show how the seasons of Mars in this planet may be calculated, &c. Which conclusions, though they belong properly to the next section, yet are so much connected with what has gone before, that we shall insert here what he says upon the subject.\n\n\"Being thus acquainted with what the inhabitants of Mars will call the obliquity of their ecliptic, and the situation of their equinoctial and solstitial points, we are furnished with the means of calculating the seasons on that planet, and may account, in a manner which I think highly probable, for the remarkable appearance about its polar regions.\n\n\"But first, it may not be improper to give an instance how to resolve any query concerning the Martian seasons. Thus, let it be required to compute the declination of the sun on Mars, June 25, 1781, at midnight of our time. If \u03c9, \u03be, \u03c0, \u03c9, &c., (fig. 67.) represent the ecliptic of Mars, and \u03c1 \u03c9 = \u03c1 \u03c9 the ecliptic of our planet, A a, b B the mutual intersection of the Martial and terrestrial ecliptics, then there is given the heliocentric longitude of Mars, \u03c1 \u03c9 = 9\u00b0 10' 30'; then taking away six signs, and \u03c1 a = 1\u00b0 17' 58', there remains b m = 1\u00b0 22' 24'.\n\nFrom this arch, with the given inclination 1\u00b0 51' of the orbits to each other, we have cosine of inclination to radius, as tangent of b m to tangent of BM = 1\u00b0 22' 33'. And taking away B \u03c1 = 1\u00b0 1\u00b0 29', which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEMENT\">complement</a> to \u03c1 B (or \u03c9 A, already shown to be 1\u00b0 28' 31'), there will remain \u03c1 M = 0\u00b0 21' 4', the place of Mars in its own orbit; that is, on the time above mentioned, the sun's longitude on Mars will be 6\u00b0 21' 4'; and the obliquity of the Martial ecliptic, 25\u00b0 42', being also given, we find, by the usual method, the sun's declination 9\u00b0 56' south.\n\n\"The analogy between Mars and the earth is perhaps by far the greatest in the whole solar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, alike referred to their diurnal motion, nearly the same; the obliquity of their respective ecliptics not very different; of earth and all the superior planets, the distance of Mars from the sun is by far the nearest alike to that of the earth; nor will the length of the Martial year appear very different.\"\nApparent different from what we enjoy, when compared to the surprising duration of the years of Jupiter, Saturn, and the Georgium Sidus. If then we find that the globe we inhabit has its polar region frozen and covered with mountains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> and snow that only partly melt when alternately exposed to the sun, I may well be permitted to surmise, that the same causes may probably have the same effect on the globe of Mars; but in 1783, I found it considerably smaller than before, and it decreased continually from the 20th of May till about the middle of September, when it seemed to be at a stand. During this last period the fourth pole had already been above eight months enjoying the benefit of summer, and still continued to receive the sun-beams, though, towards the latter end, in such an oblique direction as to be but little benefited by them.\n\nOn the other hand, in the year 1781, the north polar spot, which had then been its twelvemonth in the sunshine, and was but lately returning into darkness, appeared small, though undoubtedly increasing in size. Its not being visible in the year 1783, is no objection to these phenomena, being owing to the position of the axis, by which it was removed out of sight.\n\nThat a planetary globe, such as Mars, turning on an axis, should be of a spheroidal form, will easily find admittance, when two familiar instances in Jupiter and the earth, as well as the known laws of gravitation and the centrifugal force of rotatory bodies, lead the way to the reception of such doctrines. So far from creating difficulties, or doubts, it will rather appear fingular, that the spheroidal form of this planet has not already been noticed by former astronomers; and yet, reflecting on the general appearance of Mars, we soon find, that opportunities of making observations on its real form cannot be very frequent: for when it is near enough to view it to an advantage, we see it generally gibbous, and its appositions are so scarce, and of so short a duration, that in more than two years time, we have not above three or four weeks for such observations. Besides, astronomers being generally accustomed to see this planet distorted, the spheroidal form might easily be overlooked.\n\nSeptember 25, 1783. At 9h. 30m. the equatorial diameter of Mars measured 21\u00b0 53\u2032; the polar diameter 21\u00b0 15\u2032, full measure; that is, certainly not too small. This difference of the diameters was shown, on the 28th of the same month, to Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILTON\">Wilton</a> of Glasgow, who saw it perfectly well, so as to be convinced that it was not owing to any defect or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTORTION\">distortion</a> occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENS\">lens</a>; and because I wished him to be satisfied of the reality of the appearance, I reminded him of several precautions; such as causing the planet to pass directly through the centre of the field of view, and judging of its figure when it was most distinct and best defined, &c. Next day the difference between the two diameters was shown to Dr Blagden and Mr Aubert. The former not only saw it immediately, but thought the flattening almost as much as that of Jupiter. Mr Aubert also saw it very plainly, so as to entertain no manner of doubt about the appearance.\n\nSeptember 30th, 10h. 52m. the equatorial diameter was 22\u00b0 9\u2032, with a magnifying power of 278. By a second measure it was 22\u00b0 31\u2032, full large; the polar diameter, very exact, was 21\u00b0 26\u2032. On the first of October, at 10h. 30m. the equatorial diameter measured 123 by the micrometer, and the polar 98; the value of the divisions in seconds and thirds not being well determined, on account of some changes lately made in the focal length of the object <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> of the telescope. On the 13th, the equatorial diameter was exactly 22\u00b0 35\u2032; the polar diameter 21\u00b0 35\u2032. In a great number of succeeding observations, the same appearance occurred; but on account of the quick changes in the appearance of this planet, Dr Herschel thought proper to settle the proportion betwixt the equatorial and polar diameters from those which were made on the very day of the opposition, and which were also to be preferred on account of their being repeated with a very high power, and in a fine clear air, with two different instruments of an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. From these he determined the proportions to be as 103 to 98, or 1355 to 1272.\n\nIt has been commonly related by astronomers, that the atmosphere of this planet is possessed of such strong refractive powers, as to render the small fixed stars of Mars, near which its palls invisible. Dr Smith relates an observation of Cassini, where a star in the water of Aquarius, at the distance of six minutes from the disk of Mars, became so faint before its occultation, that it could not be seen by the naked eye, nor with a three feet telescope. This would indicate an atmosphere of a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> size and density: but the following observations of Dr Herschel seem to show that it is of much smaller dimensions. \"1783, Oct. 26th. There are two small stars preceding Mars, of different sizes; with 460 they appear both dusky red, and are pretty unequal; with 218 they appear considerably unequal. The distance from Mars of the nearest, which is also the largest, with 227 measured 3\u00b0 26\u2032 20\u2033. Some time after, the same evening, the distance was 3\u00b0 8\u2032 55\u2033, Mars being retrograde. Both of them were seen very distinctly. They were viewed with a new 20 feet reflector, and appeared very bright. October 27th, the small star is not quite so bright in proportion to the large one as it was last night, being a good deal nearer to Mars, which is now on the side of the small star; but when the planet was drawn aside, or out of view, it appeared as plainly as usual. The distance of the small star was 2\u00b0 5\u2032 25\u2033. The largest of the two stars (adds he), on which the above observations were made, cannot exceed the 12th, and the smallest the 13th or 14th magnitude; and I have no reason to suppose that they were any otherwise affected by the approach of Mars, than what the brightness of its superior light may account for. From other phenomena it appears, however, that this planet is not without a considerable atmosphere; for besides the permanent spots on its surface, I have often noticed occasional changes of partial bright belts, and also once a darkish one in a pretty high latitude; and these alterations we can hardly ascribe to any other cause than the variable disposition of clouds and vapours floating in the atmosphere of the planet.\"\nJupiter is the brightest of all the planets except Venus. He moves from west to east in a period of 4332.602208 days, exhibiting irregularities similar to those of Mars. Before he comes into opposition, and when distant from the sun about 115\u00b0, his motion becomes retrograde, and increases in swiftness till he comes into opposition. The motion then becomes gradually slower, and becomes direct when the planet advances within 115\u00b0 of the sun. The duration of the retrograde motion is about 121 days, and the arch of retrogradation described is about 10\u00b0. But there is a considerable difference both in the amount and in the duration of this retrograde motion.\n\nJupiter has the same general appearance with Mars, only that the belts on his surface are much larger and more permanent. Their general appearance, as described by Dr Long, is represented figs. 68\u201371; but they are not to be seen but by an excellent telescope. They are said to have been first discovered by Fontana and two other Italians; but Cassini was the first who gave a good account of them. Their number is very variable, as sometimes only one, and at others no fewer than eight, may be perceived. They are generally parallel to one another, but not always so; and their breadth is likewise variable, one belt having been observed to grow narrow, while another in its neighbourhood has increased in breadth, as if the one had flowed into the other: and in this case Dr Long observes, that a part of an oblique belt lay between them, as if to form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> for this purpose. The time of their continuance is very uncertain, sometimes remaining unchanged for three months; at others, new belts have been formed in an hour or two. In some of these belts large black spots have appeared, which moved swiftly over the disk from east to west, and returned in a short time to the same place; from whence the rotation of this planet about its axis has been determined. On the 9th of May 1664, Dr Hook, with a good 12 feet telescope, observed a small spot in the biggest of the three obscure belts of Jupiter; and observing it from time to time, found that in two hours it had moved from east to west about half the visible diameter of the planet. In 1665, Cassini observed a spot near the largest belt of Jupiter which is most frequently seen. It appeared round, and moved with the greatest velocity when in the middle, but appeared narrower, and moved slower, the nearer it was to the circumference. \"These circumstances (says Dr Long) showed that the spot adhered to the body of Jupiter, and was carried round upon it. It continued thereon till the year following; long enough to determine the periodical time of Jupiter's rotation upon his axis to be 9 h. 56 m.\" This principal, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> spot of one of these as it is called, is the largest, and of the longest continuance of any hitherto known, and has appeared and vanished no fewer than eight times between the years 1665 and 1708; from the year last mentioned it was invisible till 1713. The longest time of its continuing to be visible was three years; and the longest time of its disappearing was from 1708 to 1713: it seems to have some connection with the principal southern belt; for the spot has never been seen when that disappeared, though that belt has often been visible without the spot. Besides this ancient spot, Cassini, in the year 1669, saw one of less stability that did not continue of the same shape or dimensions, but broke into several small ones, whereof the revolution was but 9 h. 51 m.; and two other spots that revolved in 9 h. 52\u00bd m. The figure of Jupiter is evidently an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBLATE\">oblate</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHEROID\">spheroid</a>, the longest diameter of his disk being to the shortest as 13 to 12. His rotation is from west to east, like that of the sun, and the plane of his equator is nearly coincident with that of his orbit; so that there can scarce be any difference of seasons in that place of the planet. His rotation has been observed to be somewhat quicker in his aphelion than his perihelion. The axis of rotation is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, and the planet makes one revolution in 0.41377 day, or about 9 h. 55' and 37\". The changes in the appearance of these spots, and the difference in the time of their rotation, make it probable that they do not adhere to Jupiter, but are clouds transported by the winds with different velocities in an atmosphere subject to violent agitations.\n\nThe apparent diameter of this planet, is a maximum during his opposition to the sun, it is then equal to about 46\"; when in conjunction it is smaller, being only about 31\"; his mean apparent diameter is equal to 56\".\n\nFour little flares are observed around Jupiter, which is attended constantly accompany him. Their relative situation by four moons is continually changing. They oscillate on both sides of the planet, and their relative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> is determined by the length of these oscillations. That one in which the oscillation is shortest is called the first satellite, and so on. These satellites are analogous to our moon. See figs. 18 and 186. They are all supposed to move in ellipses; though the eccentricities of all of them are too small to be measured, excepting that of the fourth; and even this amounts to no more than 0.007 of its mean distance from the primary. The orbits of these planets were thought by Galileo to be in the same plane with that of their primary: but Mr Cassini has found that their orbits make a small angle with it; and as he did not find any difference in the place of their nodes, he concluded that they were all in the same place, and that their ascending nodes were in the middle of Aquarius. After observing them for more than 36 years, he found their greatest latitude, or deviation from the plane of Jupiter's orbit, to be 2\u00b0 55' 17\". The first of these satellites revolves at the distance of Distances 5.697 of Jupiter's semidiameters, or 1' 51\" as measured and periods by proper instruments; its periodical time is 1d. 18h. 27' 34\". The next satellite revolves at the distance of Jupiter's moons. 9.017 semidiameters, or 2' 56\", in 3 d. 13 h. 13' 43\"; the third at the distance of 14.384 semidiameters, or 4' 42\", in 7 d. 3 h. 42' 36\"; and the fourth at the distance of 25.266, or 8' 16\", in 16 d. 16 h. 32' 09\".\n\nSince the time of Cassini it has been found that the nodes of Jupiter's satellites are not in the same place; and from the different points of view in which we have an opportunity of observing them from the earth, we see them sometimes apparently moving in straight lines, and at other times in elliptic curves. All of them, by reason of their immense distance, seem to keep near their primary, and their apparent motion is a kind of oscillation like that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a>, going alternately...\nly from their greatest distance on one side to the greatest distance on the other, sometimes in a straight line, and sometimes in an elliptic curve. When a satellite is in its superior semicircle, or that half of its orbit which is more distant from the earth than Jupiter is, its motion appears to us direct, according to the order of the signs; but in its inferior semicircle, when it is nearer to us than Jupiter, its motion appears retrograde; and both these motions seem quicker the nearer the satellites are to the centre of the primary, slower the more distant they are, and at the greatest distance of all they appear for a short time to be stationary.\n\nFrom this account of the system of Jupiter and his satellites, it is evident, that occultations of them must frequently happen by their going behind their primary, or by coming in between us and it. The former takes place when they proceed towards the middle of their upper semicircle; the latter, when they pass through the same part of their inferior semicircle. Occultations of the former kind happen to the first and second satellites; at every revolution, the third very rarely escapes an occultation, but the fourth more frequently by reason of its greater distance. It is seldom that a satellite can be discovered upon the disk of Jupiter, even by the best telescopes, excepting at its first entrance, when by reason of its being more directly illuminated by the rays of the sun than the planet itself, it appears like a lucid spot upon it. Sometimes, however, a satellite in passing over the disk, appears like a dark spot, and is easily to be distinguished. This is supposed to be owing to spots on the body of these secondary planets; and it is remarkable, that the same satellite has been known to pass over the disk at one time as a dark spot, and at another so luminous that it could not be distinguished from Jupiter himself, except at its coming on and going off. To account for this, we must say, that either the spots are subject to change; or if they be permanent like those of our moon, that the satellites at different times turn different parts of their globes towards us. Possibly both these causes may contribute to produce the phenomena just mentioned. For these reasons also both the light and apparent magnitude of the satellites are variable; for the fewer spots there are upon that side which is turned towards us, the brighter it will appear; and as the bright side only can be seen, a satellite must appear larger the more of its bright side it turns towards the earth, and the less so the more it happens to be covered with spots. The fourth satellite, though generally the smallest, sometimes appears bigger than any of the rest: the third sometimes seems least, though usually the largest; nay, a satellite may be so covered with spots as to appear less than its shadow passing over the disk of the primary, though we are certain that the shadow must be smaller than the body which casts it. To a spectator placed on the surface of Jupiter, each of these satellites would put on the phases of the moon; but as the distance of any of them from Jupiter is but small when compared with the distance of that planet from the sun, the satellites are therefore illuminated by the sun very nearly in the same manner with the primary itself; hence they appear to us always round, having constantly the greatest part of their enlightened half turned towards the earth: and indeed they are so small, that were they to put on the phases of the moon, these phases could scarcely be discerned through the best telescopes.\n\nWhen the satellites pass through their inferior semicircles, they may cast a shadow upon their primary, and thus cause an eclipse of the sun to his inhabitants if there are any; and in some situations this shadow may be observed going before or following the satellites. On the other hand, in passing through their superior semicircles, the satellites may be eclipsed in the same manner as our moon by passing through the shadow of Jupiter: and this is actually the case with the first, second, and third of these bodies; but the three fourths, by reason of the largeness of its orbit, passes Jupiter's moons sometimes above or below the shadow, as is the case eclipsed with our moon. The beginnings and endings of these very revolcations are easily seen by a telescope when the earth is in a proper situation with regard to Jupiter and the sun; but when this or any other planet is in conjunction with the sun, the superior brightness of that light obscures both it and the satellites invisible. From occultations, the time of its first appearing after a conjunction until &c. of Jupiter near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPOSITION\">apposition</a>, only the immersions of the satellites into its shadow, or the beginnings of the eclipses, satellites are visible; at the apposition, only the occultations of the satellites, by going behind or coming before their primary, are observable; and from the apposition to the conjunction, only the immersions, or end of the eclipses, are to be seen. This is exactly true in the first satellite, of which we can never see an immersion with its immediately subsequent emergence: and it is but rarely that they can be both seen in the second; as in order to their being so, that satellite must be near one of its limits, at the same time that the planet is near its perihelion and quadrature with the sun. With regard to the third, when Jupiter is more than 46 degrees from conjunction with, or opposition to, the sun, both its immersions and immediately subsequent emergences are visible; as they likewise are in the fourth, when the distance of Jupiter from conjunction or apposition is 24 degrees.\n\nWhen Jupiter is in quadrature with the sun, the earth is farther out of the line that passes through the centres of the sun and Jupiter, and therefore the shadow of the planet is then most exposed to our view: but even then the body of the planet will hide from us one side of that part of the shadow which is nearest to it, through which the first satellite passes; which is the reason that though we see the entrance of that satellite into the shadow, or its coming out from thence, as the earth is situated on the east or west side thereof, we cannot see them both; whereas the other satellites going through the shadow at a greater distance from Jupiter, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INGRESS\">ingress</a> and egress are both visible.\n\nSect. V. Of Saturn.\n\nSaturn is likewise a very conspicuous planet, though not so brilliant as Jupiter. The period of his sidereal revolution round the earth, is 1079.077213 days. He moves from west to east nearly in the plane of the ecliptic, and exhibits irregularities similar to those of Jupiter and Mars. He becomes retrograde both before and after his opposition, when at the distance of about 109\u00b0 from the sun. His retrograde motion continues about 139 days, and during its continuance he describes...\nApparent an arc of about 6\u00b0. His diameter is a maximum at his opposition, and his mean apparent diameter is 18\u00b0.\n\nSaturn, when viewed through a good telescope, makes a more remarkable appearance than any of the other planets. Galileo first discovered his uncommon shape, which he thought to be like two small globes, one on each side of a large one; and he published his discovery in a Latin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>: the meaning of which was, that he had seen him appear with three bodies; though, in order to keep the discovery a secret, the letters were transposed. Having viewed him for two years, he was surprised to see him become quite round without these appendages, and then after some time to assume them as before. These adjoining globes were what are now called the ansae of his ring, the true shape of which was first discovered by Huygens about 42 years after Galileo, first with a telescope of 12 feet, and then with one of 23 feet, which magnified objects 100 times. From the discoveries made by him and other astronomers, it appears that this planet is surrounded by a broad thin ring, the edge of which reflects little or none of the sun's light to us, but the planes of the ring reflect the light in the same manner that the planet itself does; and if we suppose the diameter of Saturn to be divided into three equal parts, the diameter of the ring is about seven of these parts. The ring is detached from the body of Saturn in such a manner, that the distance between the innermost part of the ring and the body is equal to its breadth. If we had a view of the planet and his rings, with our eyes, perpendicular to one of the planes of the latter, we should see them as in figs. 72.; but our eye is never so much elevated above either plane as to have the visual ray stand at right angles to it, nor indeed is it ever elevated more than about 30 degrees above it; so that the ring, being commonly viewed at an oblique angle, appears of an oval form, and through very good telescopes double, as represented fig. 73. and 74. Both the outward and inward rim is projected into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELLIPSIS\">ellipsis</a>, more or less oblong according to the different degrees of obliquity with which it is viewed. Sometimes our eye is in the plane of the ring, and then it becomes invisible; either because the outward edge is not fitted to reflect the sun's light, or more probably because it is too thin to be seen at such a distance. As the plane of this ring keeps always parallel to itself, that is, its situation in one part of the orbit is always parallel to that in any other part, it disappears twice in every revolution of the planet, that is, about once in 15 years; and he sometimes appears quite round for nine months together. At other times, the distance between the body of the planet and the ring is very perceptible; inasmuch that Mr Whiston tells us of Dr Clarke's father having seen a star through the opening, and supposed him to have been the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who ever saw a sight so rare, as the opening, though certainly very large, appears very small to us. When Saturn appears round, if our eye be in the plane of the ring, it will appear as a dark line across the middle of the planet's disk; and if our eye be elevated above the plane of the ring, a shadowy belt will be visible, caused by the shadow of the ring as well as by the interposition of part of it between the eye and the planet. The shadow of the ring is broadest when the sun is most elevated, but its obscure parts appear broadest when our eye is most elevated above the plane of it. When it appears double, the ring next the body of the planet appears brightest; when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEAVEN\">Heaven</a> ring appears of an elliptical form, the parts about ly Bodies.\n\nThe ends of the largest axis are called the ansae, as has already been mentioned. These, a little before and after the disappearance of the ring, are of unequal magnitude: the largest ansa is longer visible before the planet's round phase, and appears again sooner than the ring of Saturn. On the first of October 1714, the largest ansa turned upon the east side, and on the 12th on the west side, barely has a shadow of the disk of the planet, which makes it probable that on its axis the ring has a rotation round an axis. Herschel demonstrated, that it revolves in its own plane in 10 hours 32' 15.4\". The observations of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> have added greatly to our knowledge of Saturn's ring. According to him there is one single, dark, considerably broad line, belt, or zone, which he has constantly found on the north side of the ring. As this dark belt is subject to no change whatever, it is probably owing to some permanent construction of the surface of the ring: this construction cannot be owing to the shadow of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of mountains, since it is visible all round on the ring; for there could be no shade at the ends of the ring: a similar argument will apply against the opinion of very extended caverns. It is pretty evident that this dark zone is contained between two concentric circles; for all the phenomena correspond with the projection of such a zone. The nature of the ring Dr Herschel thinks no less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> than that of Saturn itself, and it is observed to cast a strong shadow upon the planet. The light of the ring is also generally brighter than that of the planet; for the ring appears sufficiently bright when the telescope affords scarcely light enough for Saturn. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> concludes that the edge of the ring is not flat, but spherical or spheroidal. The dimensions of the ring, or of the two rings with the space between them, Dr Herschel gives as below:\n\n| Description                  | Miles |\n|------------------------------|-------|\n| Inner diameter of smaller ring | 146345 |\n| Outside diam. of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DITTO\">ditto</a>        | 184393 |\n| Inner diam. of larger ring    | 192438 |\n| Outside diam. of ditto        | 224883 |\n| Breadth of the inner ring     | 20000 |\n| Breadth of the outer ring     | 7200 |\n| Breadth of the vacant space, or dark zone | 2839 |\n\nThere have been various conjectures relative to the nature of this ring. Some persons have imagined that the diameter of the planet Saturn was once equal to the present diameter of the outer ring, and that it was hollow; the present body being contained within the former surface, in like manner as a kernel is contained within its shell: they suppose that, in consequence of some concussion, or other cause, the outer shell all fell down to the inner body, and left only the ring at the greater distance from the centre, as we now perceive it. This conjecture is in some measure corroborated by the consideration, that both the planet and its ring perform their rotations about the same common axis, and in very nearly the same time. But from the observations of Dr Herschel, he thus concludes: \"It does not appear to me that there is sufficient ground for admitting the ring of Saturn to be of a very changeable nature, and I guess that its phenomena will hereafter be fully explained, as to reconcile.\"\nreconcile all observations. In the meanwhile we must withhold a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> judgment of its construction, till we can have more observations. Its division, however, into two very unequal parts, can admit of no doubt.\n\nThe diameters of Saturn are not equal: that which is perpendicular to the plane of his ring appears less by one-eleventh than the diameter situated in that plane. If we compare this form with that of Jupiter, we have reason to conclude that Saturn turns rapidly round his shorter axis, and that the ring moves in the plane of his equator. Herschel has confirmed this opinion by actual observation. He has ascertained the duration of a revolution of Saturn round his axis to amount to 0.428 day. Huygens observed five belts upon this planet nearly parallel to the equator.\n\nSaturn is still better attended than Jupiter (see fig. 18, and p. 186.) having, besides the ring above-mentioned, no fewer than seven moons continually circulating round him. The first, at the distance of 2,097 semidiameters of his ring, and 4,803 of the planet itself, performs its revolution in 1 d. 21 h. 18' 57\"; the second, at 2,686 semidiameters of the ring, and 6,268 of Saturn, revolves in 2 d. 17 h. 41' 22\"; the third, at the distance of 8,754 semidiameters of Saturn, and 3,752 of the ring, in 4 d. 12 h. 25' 12\"; the fourth, called the Huygenian satellite, at 8,608 semidiameters of the ring, and 20,295 of Saturn, revolves in 15 d. 22 h. 41' 12\"; while the fifth, placed at the vast distance of 59,154 semidiameters of Saturn, or 25,348 of his ring, does not perform its revolution in less than 79 d. 7 h. 47' 00\". The orbits of all these satellites, except the fifth, are nearly in the same plane, which makes an angle with the plane of Saturn's orbit of about 31\u00b0; and by reason of their being inclined at such large angles, they cannot pass either across their primary or behind it with respect to the earth, except when very near their nodes; so that eclipses of them happen much more seldom than of the satellites of Jupiter. There is, however, an account in the Philos. Transact. of an occultation of the fourth satellite behind the body of Saturn; and there is a curious account by Caffini in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the Royal Academy for 1692, of a fixed star being covered by the fourth satellite, so that for 13 minutes they appeared both as one star. By reason of their extreme smallness, these satellites cannot be seen unless the air be very clear; and Dom. Caffini for several years observed the fifth satellite to grow less and less as it went through the eastern part of its orbit until it became quite invisible; while in the western part it gradually became more and more bright until it arrived at its greatest splendor.\u2014\"This phenomenon (says Dr Long) cannot be better accounted for than by supposing one half the surface of this satellite to be unfit to reflect the light of the sun in sufficient quantity to make it visible, and that it turns round its axis nearly in the same time as it revolves round its primary; and that, by means of this rotation, and keeping always the same face toward Saturn, we upon the earth may, during one half of its periodical time, be able to see successively more and more of its bright side, and during the other half of its period have more and more of the spotted or dark side turned towards us. In the year 1705, this satellite unexpectedly became visible in all parts of its orbit through the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>\n\ntelescopes that were before often made use of to view it in the eastern part without success: this shows the spots Motions of the Heavenly Bodies, other of the primary planets, are not permanent, but subject to change.\"\n\nThe two other satellites were discovered by Dr Herschel in 1787 and 1788. They are nearer to Saturn than any of the other five. But in order to prevent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>, they have been called the 6th and 7th satellites. The fifth satellite has been observed by Dr Herschel to turn once round its axis, exactly in the time in which it revolves round Saturn. In this respect it resembles our moon.\n\nSect. VI. Of Herschel.\n\nThe planets hitherto described have been known from the remotest antiquity; but the planet Herschel, called also the Georgium Sidus, and Uranus, escaped the attention of the ancient astronomers. Flamsteed, Mayer, and Le Monnier had observed it as a small star; but in 1781 Dr Herschel discovered its motion, and ascertained it to be a planet. Like Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, it moves from west to east round the sun. The duration of its sidereal revolution is 30,689 days. Its motion, which is nearly in the plane of the ecliptic, begins to be retrograde before and after the opposition, when the planet is 103\u00b0 from the sun; its retrograde motion continues for about 151 days; and the arc of retrogradation amounts to 3.6\u00b0. If we judge of the distance of this planet by the slowness of its motions, it ought to be at the very confines of the planetary system.\n\nThe apparent magnitude of this planet is so small that it can seldom be seen with the naked eye. It is sometimes accompanied by five satellites: two of them, which were discovered by Dr Herschel in 1787, revolve about that planet in periods of 8 d. 17 h. 1 m. 19 sec. and 13 d. 11 h. 5 m. 15 sec. respectively, the angular distances from the primary being 33\" and 44.5\": their orbits are nearly perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the discovery of the other four, with such elements as could then be ascertained, are given in the Philosophical Transactions for 1798, Part I. The precise periods of these additional satellites cannot be ascertained without a greater number of observations than had been made when Dr Herschel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> the account of their discovery to the Royal Society; but he gave the following estimates as the most probable which could be formed by means of the data then determined. Admitting the distance of the interior satellite to be 25\", its periodical revolution will be 5 d. 21 h. 25 m. If the intermediate satellite be placed at an equal distance between the two old satellites, or at 38\u00b0, its period will be 10 d. 23 h. 4 m. The nearest exterior satellite is about double the distance of the farthest old one; its periodical time will therefore be about 38 d. 1 h. 49 m. The most distant satellite is full four times as far from the planet as the old second satellite; it will therefore take at least 107 d. 16 h. 40 m. to complete one revolution. All these satellites perform their revolutions in their orbits contrary to the order of the signs; that is, their real motion is retrograde.\n\nSect.\nSect. VII. Of Ceres and Pallas.\n\nThese two planets, lately discovered by Piazzi and Olbers, two foreign astronomers, ought to have followed Mars in the order of description, as their orbits are placed between those of Mars and Jupiter; but as they have been observed only for a very short time, we judged it more proper to reserve the account of them till we came to the words Ceres and Pallas, when the elements of their orbits will in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> be determined with more precision than at present. They are invisible to the naked eye; and Dr Herschel has ascertained that their size is extremely small. For that reason, together with the great obliquity of their orbits, he has proposed to distinguish them from the planets, and to call them asteroids.\n\nChap. IV. Of the Comets.\n\nThe planets are not the only moving bodies visible in the heavens. There are others which appear at uncertain intervals, and with a very different aspect from the planets. These are very numerous, and no fewer than 450 are supposed to belong to our solar system. They are called Comets, from their having a long tail, somewhat resembling the appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>. This, however, is not always the case; for some comets have appeared which were as well defined, and as round as planets; but in general they have a luminous matter diffused around them, or projecting out from them, which to appearance very much resembles the Aurora Borealis. When these appear, they come in a direct line towards the sun, as if they were going to fall into his body; and after having disappeared for some time in consequence of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROXIMITY\">proximity</a> to that luminary, they fly off again on the other side as fast as they came, projecting a tail much greater and brighter in their receds from him than when they advanced towards him; but, getting daily at a farther distance from us in the heavens, they continually lose of their splendour, and at last totally disappear. Their apparent magnitude is very different; sometimes they appear only of the biggest of the fixed stars; at other times they will equal the diameter of Venus, and sometimes even of the sun or moon. So, in 1652, Hevelius observed a comet which seemed not inferior to the moon in size, though it had not so bright a splendour, but appeared with a pale and dim light, and had a dismal aspect. These bodies will also sometimes lose their splendour suddenly, while their apparent bulk remains unaltered. With respect to their apparent motions, they have all the inequalities of the planets; sometimes seeming to go forwards, sometimes backwards, and sometimes to be stationary.\n\nThe comets, viewed through a telescope, have a very different appearance from any of the planets. The nucleus, or star, seems much more dim. Sturmius tells us, that observing the comet of 1680 with a telescope, it appeared like a coal dimly glowing; or a rude <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of matter illuminated with a dusky fumid light, less sensible at the extremes than in the middle; and not at all like a star, which appears with a round disk and a vivid light.\n\nHevelius observed of the comet in 1661, that its body was of a yellowish colour, bright and conspicuous, but without any glittering light. In the middle was a dense ruddy nucleus, almost equal to Jupiter, encompassed with a much fainter thinner matter. February 5th. The nucleus was somewhat bigger and brighter, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> colour, but its light more dusky than the rest of the stars; it appeared also divided into a number of parts.\u2014Feb. 6th. The nuclei still appeared, though less than before. One of them on the left side of the lower part of the disk appeared to be much denser and brighter than the rest; its body round, and representing a little lucid star; the nuclei still encompassed with another kind of matter.\u2014Feb. 10th. The nuclei more obscure and confused, but brighter at top than at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>.\u2014Feb. 13th. The head diminished much both in brightness and in magnitude.\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 2d. Its roundness a little impaired, and the edges lacerated.\u2014March 28th. Its matter much dispersed; and no distinct nucleus at all appearing.\n\nWegelius, who saw through a telescope the comet of 1664, the moon, and a little cloud illuminated by the sun, at the same time, observed that the moon appeared of a continued luminous surface, but the comet very different, being perfectly like the little cloud enlightened by the sun's beams.\n\nThe comets, too, are to appearance surrounded with atmospheres of a prodigious size, often rising ten times spheres and higher than the nucleus. They have often likewise phales of different phases, like the moon.\n\n\"The head of a comet (says Dr Long) to the eye, Dr Long's unassisted by glasses, appears sometimes like a cloudy account of star; sometimes shines with a dull light like that of them, the planet Saturn: some comets have been said to equal, some to exceed, stars of the first magnitude; some to have surpassed Jupiter, and even Venus; and to have cast a shadow as Venus sometimes does.\n\n\"The head of a comet, seen through a good telescope, appears to consist of a solid globe, and an atmosphere that surrounds it. The solid part is frequently called the nucleus; which through a telescope is easily distinguished from the atmosphere or hairy appearance.\n\n\"A comet is generally attended with a blaze or tail, whereby it is distinguished from a star or planet; as it is also by its motion. Sometimes the tail only of a comet has been visible at a place where the head has been all the while under the horizon; such an appearance is called a beam.\n\n\"The nucleus of the comet of 1618 is said, a few days after coming into view, to have broken into three or four parts of irregular figures. One observer compares them to so many burning coals; and says they changed their situation while he was looking at them, as when a person fires a fire; and a few days after were broken into a great number of smaller pieces. Another account of the same is, that on the 1st and 4th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>, the nucleus appeared to be a round, solid, and luminous body, of a dusky lead colour, larger than any star of the first magnitude. On the 8th of the same month it was broken into three or four parts of irregular figures; and on the 20th was changed into a cluter of small stars.\n\n\"As the tail of a comet is owing to the heat of the sun, it grows larger as the comet approaches near to it.\"\nApparent and shortens as it recedes from, that luminary. If the tail of a comet were to continue of the same length, it would appear longer or shorter according to the different views of the spectator; for if his eye be in a line drawn through the middle of the tail lengthwise, or nearly so, the tail will not be distinguished from the rest of the atmosphere, but the whole will appear round; if the eye be a little out of that line, the tail will appear short as in fig. 75.; and it is called a bearded comet when the tail hangs down towards the horizon, as in that figure. If the tail of a comet be viewed sidewise, the whole length of it is seen. It is obvious to remark, that the nearer the eye is to the tail, the greater will be the apparent length thereof.\n\n\"The tails of comets often appear bent, as in fig. 76. and 77. owing to the resistance of the aether, which, though extremely small, may have a sensible effect on so thin a vapour as the tails consist of. This bending is seen only when the earth is not in the plane of the orbit of the comet continued. When that plane passes through the eye of the spectator, the tail appears straight, as in fig. 78. 79.\n\n\"Longomontanus mentions a comet, that, in 1618, Dec. 10th, had a tail above 100 degrees in length; which shows that it must then have been very near the earth. The tail of a comet will at the same time appear of different lengths in different places, according as the air in one place is clearer than in another. It need not be mentioned, that in the same place, the difference in the eyes of the spectators will be the cause of their disagreeing in their estimate of the length of the tail of a comet.\n\n\"Hevelius is very particular in telling us, that he observed the comet of 1665 to cast a shadow upon the tail; for in the middle thereof there appeared a dark line. It is somewhat surprising, that Hooke should be positive in affirming, on the contrary, that the place where the shadow of the comet should have been, if there had been any shadow, was brighter than any other part of the tail. He was of opinion that comets have some light of their own: His observations were made in a hurry; he owns they were short and trifling. Hevelius's were made with so much care, that there is more reason to depend upon them. Dom. Cassini observed, in the tail of the comet of 1680, a darkness in the middle; and the like was taken notice of by a curious observer in that of 1744.\n\n\"There are three comets, viz. of 1680, 1744, and 1759, that deserve to have a farther account given of them. The comet of 1680 was remarkable for its near approach to the sun; so near, that in its perihelion it was not above a sixth part of the diameter of that luminary from the surface thereof. Fig. 77. taken from Newton's Principia, represents so much of the trajectory of this comet as it passed through while it was visible to the inhabitants of our earth, in going from and returning to its perihelion. It shows also the tail, as it appeared on the days mentioned in the figure. The tail, like that of other comets, increased in length and brightness as it came nearer to the sun; and grew shorter and fainter as it went farther from him and from the earth, till that and the comet were too far off to be any longer visible.\n\n\"The comet of 1744 was first seen at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAUSANNE\">Lausanne</a> in Switzerland, Dec. 13. 1743, N. S. From that time it increased in brightness and magnitude as it was coming nearer to the sun. The diameter of it, when at the distance of the sun from us, measured about one minute; which brings it out equal to three times the diameter of the earth. It came so near Mercury, that, if its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> had been proportional to its magnitude, it was thought probable it would have disturbed the motion of that planet. Mr Betts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, however, from some observations made there, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Macclesfield's observatory at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHERBURN\">Sherburn</a>, found, that when the comet was at its least distance from Mercury, and almost twice as near the sun as that planet was, it was still distant from him a fifth part of the distance of the sun from the earth; and could therefore have no effect upon the planet's motions. He judged the comet to be at least equal in magnitude to the earth. He says, that in the evening of Jan. 23d, this comet appeared exceedingly distinct and bright, and the diameter of its nucleus nearly equal to that of Jupiter. Its tail extended above 16 degrees from its body; and was in length, supposing the sun's parallax 10', no less than 23 millions of miles. Dr Bevis, in the month of May 1744, made four observations of Mercury, and found the places of that planet, calculated from correct tables, differed so little from the places observed, as to show that the comet had no influence upon Mercury's motion.\n\n\"The nucleus, which had before been always round, on the 10th of February appeared oblong in the direction of the tail, and seemed divided into two parts, by a black stroke in the middle. One of the parts had a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a> brighter than the tail; this beard was surrounded by two unequal dark strokes, that separated the beard from the hair of the comet. The odd phenomena disappeared the next day, and nothing was seen but irregular obscure spaces like smoke in the middle of the tail; and the head resumed its natural form. February 15th, the tail was divided into two branches; the eastern part about seven or eight degrees long, the western 24. On the 23d, the tail began to be bent; it showed no tail till it was as near to the sun as the orbit of Mars; the tail grew longer as it approached nearer the sun; and at its greatest length was computed to equal a third part of the distance of the earth from the sun. Fig. 76. is a view of this comet, taken by an observer at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>. I remember that, in viewing it, I thought the tail seemed to sparkle, or vibrate luminous particles. Hevelius mentions the like in other comets; and that their tails lengthen and shorten while we are viewing. This is probably owing to the motion of our air.\n\n\"The comet of 1759 did not make any considerable appearance by reason of the unfavourable situation of the earth all the time its tail might otherwise have been conspicuous; the comet being then too near the sun to be seen by us; but deserves our particular consideration, as it was the first that ever had its return foretold.\"\n\nHevelius gives pictures of comets of various shapes; as they are described by historians to have been like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUCKLER\">buckler</a>, a tun, &c. These are drawn by fancy only, from the description in words. He gives, however, also pictures of some comets, engraved by his\nhis own hand from the views he had of them through a very long and excellent telescope. In these we find changes in the nucleus and the atmosphere of the same comet. The nucleus of the comet of 1661, which in one observation appeared as one round body, as it is represented in fig. 87, in subsequent views seemed to consist of several smaller ones separated from one another, as in fig. 86. The atmosphere surrounding the nucleus, at different times, varied in the extent thereof; as did also the tail in length and breadth. The nuclei of other comets, as has already been observed, have sometimes phases like the moon. Those of 1744 and 1769 had both this kind of appearance. See fig. 34.\n\n**CHAP. V. Of the fixed Stars.**\n\nThe parallax of the stars is infensible. When viewed through the best telescopes, they appear not at all magnified, but rather diminished in bulk; by reason, as is thought by some, that the telescope takes off that twinkling appearance they make to the naked eye; but by others, more probably, that the telescope tube excludes a quantity of the rays of light, which are not only emitted from the particular stars themselves, but by many thousands more, which falling upon our eyelids and the aerial particles about us, are reflected into our eyes so strongly as to excite vibrations, not only on those points of the retina where the images of the stars are formed, but also in other points at the same distance round about. This without the telescope makes us imagine the stars to be much bigger than when we see them only by a few rays coming directly from them, so as to enter our eyes without being intermixed with others. The smallness of their apparent diameter is proved by the suddenness with which they disappear on their occultations by the moon. The time which they take does not amount to one second, which shows their apparent diameter not to exceed 4\". The vivacity of their light, compared with their small diameter, leads us to suppose them at a much greater distance than the planets, and to confine them as luminous bodies like our sun, instead of borrowing their light from that luminary like the planets.\n\nThe stars, on account of their apparently various magnitudes, have been distributed into several classes or orders. Those which appear largest are called *stars of the first magnitude*; the next to them in lustre, *stars of the second magnitude*; and so on to the *sixth*, which are the smallest that are visible to the bare eye. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> having been made long before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of telescopes, the stars which cannot be seen without the assistance of these instruments are distinguished by the names of *telescopic stars*.\n\nThe ancients divided the starry sphere into particular constellations, or systems of stars, according as they lay near one another, so as to occupy those spaces which the figures of different sorts of animals or things would take up, if they were there delineated. And those stars which could not be brought into any particular constellation were called *unformed stars*.\n\nThis division of the stars into different constellations, or asterisms, serves to distinguish them from one another, so that any particular star may be readily found in the heavens by means of a celestial globe; on which the constellations are delineated, as to put the most remarkable stars into such parts of the figures as are likely to be most easily distinguished. The number of the ancient constellations is 48, and upon our present globes about 70. On Senex's globes are inserted Bayer's letters; the first in the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a> being put to the biggest star in each constellation, the second to the next, and so on; by which means, every star is as easily found as if a name were given to it. Thus, if the star \u03b3 in the constellation of the Ram be mentioned, every astronomer knows as well what star is meant as if it were pointed out to him in the heavens. See fig. 205, 206, where the stars are represented with the figures of the animals from whence the constellations are marked.\n\nThere is also a division of the heavens into three parts. 1. The zodiac (\u03b6\u03c9\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2), from \u03b6\u03ce\u03bf\u03bd, z\u014don, \"an animal,\" because most of the constellations in it, which are 12 in number, have the names of animals; as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARIES\">Aries</a> the ram, Taurus the bull, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEMINI\">Gemini</a> the twins, Cancer the crab, Leo the lion, Virgo the virgin, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LIBRA\">Libra</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a>, Scorpio the scorpion, Sagittarius the archer, Capricornus the goat, Aquarius the water-bearer, and Pisces the fishes. The zodiac goes quite round the heavens: it is about 16 degrees broad, so that it takes in the orbits of all the planets, and likewise the orbit of the moon. Along the middle of this zone or belt is the ecliptic, or circle which the earth describes annually as seen from the sun, and which the sun appears to describe as seen from the earth. 2. All that region of the heavens which is on the north side of the zodiac, containing 21 constellations. And, 3. That on the south side, containing 15.\n\nThe ancients divided the zodiac into the above 12 constellations or signs in the following manner: They divided a vessel with a small hole in the bottom, and, having filled it with water, suffered the same to drip drop by drop into another vessel set beneath to receive it; beginning at the moment when some star rose, and continuing till it rose the next following night. The water falling down into the receiver they divided into 12 equal parts; and having two other small vessels in readiness, each of them fit to contain one part, they again poured all the water into the upper vessel; and, observing the rising of some star in the zodiac, they at the same time suffered the water to drop into one of the small vessels; and as soon as it was full, they shifted it, and set an empty one in its place. When each vessel was full, they took notice what star of the zodiac rose; and though this could not be done in one night, yet in many they observed the rising of 12 stars or points, by which they divided the zodiac into 12 parts.\n\nThe names of the constellations, and the number of stars observed in each of them by different astronomers are as follow.\n### The Ancient Constellations\n\n|

Some of them have also disappeared for some time, and again become visible.\n\nWe are also assured from the observations of astronomers, that some stars have been observed which never were seen before, and for a certain time they have distinguished themselves by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPERLATIVE\">superlative</a> lustre; but afterwards decreasing, they vanished by degrees, and were no more to be seen. One of these stars being first seen and observed by Hipparchus, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of the ancient astronomers, set him upon composing a catalogue of the fixed stars, that by it posterity might learn whether any of the stars perish, and others are produced afresh.\n\nAfter several ages, another new star appeared to Tycho Brahe and the astronomers who were cotemporary with him; which put him on the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> with Hipparchus, namely, the making a catalogue of the fixed stars. Of this, and other stars which have appeared since that time, we have the following history by Dr Halley:\n\n\"The first new star in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol5.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> of Cassiopeia, was not seen by Cornelius Gemma on the 8th of November 1572, who says, he that night considered that part of the heaven in a very serene sky, and saw it not; but that the next night, November 9, it appeared with a splendor surpassing all the fixed stars, and scarce less bright than Venus. This was not seen by Tycho Brahe before the 14th of the same month; but from thence he assures us that it gradually decreased and died away, so as in March 1574, after fifteen months, to be no longer visible; and at this day no signs of it remain. The place thereof in the sphere of fixed stars, by the accurate observations of the same Tycho, was $0^\\circ 0^\\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a> 17'' \\text{a} 1^\\text{ma} * 09^\\text{h}$, with $53^\\circ 45'$ north latitude.\n\n\"Such another star was seen and observed by the scholars of Kepler, to begin to appear on Sept. 30th, anno 1604, which was not to be seen the day before; but it broke out at once with a lustre surpassing that of Jupiter; and like the former, it died away gradually, and in much about the same time disappeared totally, there remaining no footsteps thereof in January 1605. This was near the ecliptic, following the right leg of Serpentarius; and by the observations of Kepler and others, was in $7^\\text{sec} 20^\\text{oc} \\text{a} 1^\\text{ma} * 09^\\text{h}$, with north latitude $1^\\circ 56'$. These two seem to be of a distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> from the rest, and nothing like them has appeared since.\n\n\"But between them, viz. in the year 1596, we have the first account of the wonderful star in Collo Ceti, Apparent seen by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> Fabricius on the third of August, $8^\\text{vct}$, as bright as a star of the 3rd magnitude, which has been since found to appear and disappear periodically; its period being precisely enough seven revolutions in six years, though it returns not always with the same lustre. Nor is it ever totally extinguished, but may at all times be seen with a fix feet tube. This was singular in its kind, till that in Collo Cygni was discovered. It precedes the first star of Aries $1^\\circ 40'$, with $15^\\circ 57'$ south latitude.\n\n\"Another new star was first discovered by William Janfonius in the year 1600, in pectore, or rather in eductione, Colli Cygni, which exceeded not the third magnitude. This having continued some years, became at length to fall, as to be thought by some to have disappeared entirely: but in the years 1657, 1658, and 1659, it again arose to the third magnitude; though soon after it decayed by degrees to the fifth or sixth magnitude, and at this day is to be seen as such in $9^\\circ 18' 38'' \\text{a} 1^\\text{ma} * 09^\\text{h}$, with $55^\\circ 29'$ north latitude.\n\n\"A fifth new star was first seen by Hevelius in the year 1670, on July 15th, $8^\\text{vct}$, as a star of the third magnitude, but by the beginning of October was scarce to be perceived by the naked eye. In April following it was again as bright as before, or rather greater than of the third magnitude, yet wholly disappeared about the middle of August. The next year, in March 1672, it was seen again, but not exceeding the sixth magnitude: since when, it has been no further visible, though we have frequently sought for its return; its place is $9^\\circ 3' 17'' \\text{a} 1^\\text{ma} * 09^\\text{h}$, and has lat. north $47^\\circ 28'$.\n\n\"The sixth and last is that discovered by Mr G. Kirch in the year 1686, and its period determined to be of $404\\frac{1}{2}$ days; and though it rarely exceeds the fifth magnitude, yet it is very regular in its returns, as we found in the year 1714. Since then we have watched, as the absence of the moon and clearness of the weather would permit, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CATCH\">catch</a> the first beginning of its appearance in a fix feet tube, that, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> a very great aperture, discovers most minute stars. And on June 15th, last, it was first perceived like one of the very least telecopical stars: but in the rest of that month and July, it gradually increased, so as to become in August visible to the naked eye: and so continued till the month of September. After that, it again died away by degrees: and on the 8th of December, at night, was scarce discernible by the tube; and, as near as could be guessed, equal to what it was at its first appearance on June 25th: so that this year it has been seen in all near five months, which is but little less than half its period; and the middle, and consequently the greatest brightness, falls about the 10th of September.\"\n\nConcerning the changes which happen among the fixed stars, Mr Montanere, professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> at Bologna, gave the following account, in a letter to the Royal Society, dated April 30th 1670. \"There are not wanting in the heavens two stars of the second fixed stars magnitude in the stern of the ship <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARGO\">Argo</a>, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-YARD\">yard</a>; Bayerus marked them with the letters $\\beta$ and $\\chi$. I and others observed them in the year 1664, upon the occasion of the comet that appeared that year: when they disappeared first, I know not: only I am sure that in the year 1668, upon the 10th of April, there was not the least glimpse of them to be seen; and yet the\nApparent Motions of the Heavenly Bodies.\n\nThe late improvements in astronomy, and particularly those in the construction of telescopes, have now given astronomers an opportunity of observing the changes which take place among the stars with much greater accuracy than could be formerly done. In a paper in the 76th volume of the Philosophical Transactions, Mr Edward Pigot gives a dissertation on the stars suspected by the astronomers of last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> to be changeable. For the greater accuracy in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of his subject, he divides them into two classes; one containing those which are undoubtedly changeable, and the other those which are only suspected to be so. The former contains a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of 12 stars, from the first to the fourth magnitudes; including the new one which appeared in Cassiopeia in 1572, and that in Serpentarius in 1624; the other contains the names of 38 stars of all magnitudes, from the first to the seventh. He is of opinion, that the celebrated new star in Cassiopeia is a periodical one, and that it returns once in 150 years. Mr Keill is of the same opinion; and Mr Pigot thinks, that its not being observed at the expiration of each period is no argument against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of that opinion; \"since (says he), perhaps, as with most of the variables, it may at different periods have different degrees of lustre, so as sometimes only to increase to the ninth magnitude; and if this should be the case, its period is probably much shorter.\" For this reason, in September 1782, he took a plan of the small stars near the place where it formerly appeared, but in four years had observed no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>.\n\nThe star in the neck of the Whale had also been examined by Mr Pigot from the end of 1782 to 1786, but he never found it exceed the fifth magnitude; though Mr Goodricke had observed it on the 9th of August to be of the second magnitude, and on the 3rd of September the same year it was of the third magnitude. Mr Pigot deduced its period from its apparent equality with a small star in the neighbourhood, and thence found it to be 320, 328, and 337 days.\n\nThe most remarkable of these changeable stars is that called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALGOL\">Algol</a>, in the head of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDUSA\">Medusa</a>. It had long been known to be variable; but its period was first ascertained by Mr Goodricke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, who began to observe it in the beginning of 1783. It changes continually from the first to the fourth magnitude; and the time taken up from its greatest diminution to its least is found, at a mean, to be 2 d. 20 h. 49 m. and 3 sec. During four hours it gradually diminishes in lustre, which it recovers during the succeeding four hours; and in the remaining part of the period it invariably preserves its greatest lustre, and after the expiration of the term its diminution again commences. According to Mr Pigot, the degree of brightness of this star when at its minimum is variable in different periods, and he is of the same opinion with regard to its brightness when at its full; but whether these differences return regularly or not, has not been determined.\n\nThe 420th of Mayer's catalogue, in Leo, has lately been shown to be variable by Mr Koch. Some years before 1782, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> perceived it undoubtedly finaller than the 419th of the same catalogue. In February that year, it was of the same brightness with the 419th, that is, of the seventh magnitude. In April 1783, it was of the ninth magnitude; and in the same month 1784, it was of the tenth. Mr Pigot could never observe this star, though he frequently looked for it with a night-glass, and on the fifth of April 1785 with a three-feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACHROMATIC\">achromatic</a> transit instrument.\n\nIn 1704, Maraldi observed a variable star in Hydra, whose period he settled at about two years, though star in Hydra with considerable variations; but from the observations even of Maraldi, Mr Pigot concludes, that its period was then only 494 days; and from others made by himself, he thinks that now it is only 487 days; so that since the time of Maraldi it has shortened seven days. The particulars relating to this star are as follow. 1. When at its full brightness it is of the fourth magnitude, and does not perceptibly change for a fortnight. 2. It is about six months in increasing from the tenth magnitude and returning to the same; so that it may be considered as invisible during that time. 3. It is considerably more quick, perhaps one half more so, in its increase than in its decrease. 4. Though when at its full it may always be styled a star of the fourth magnitude, it does not constantly attain the same degree of brightness, but the differences are very small. This star is the 33th of Hydra in Hevelius's catalogue, and is marked by him of the fifth magnitude.\n\nThe new star in Serpentarius, observed by Kepler, seems to have been of the same nature with that of Cassiopeia; and Mr Pigot therefore looks upon it also to be a periodical one, though, after taking a plan of the nearest stars in that part of the heavens, in the year 1782, he could, in four years time, perceive no alteration.\n\nThe variation of the star \u03b2 Lyrae was discovered by Mr Goodricke above mentioned, who supposes its period to be six days nine hours; which coincides with the opinion of Mr Pigot.\n\nThe new star near the Swan's Head, observed by Don Anthelme in December 1669, soon became of the third magnitude, and disappeared in 1672. Mr Pigot has constantly looked for it since November 1781, but without success. He is of opinion, that had it only increased to the 10th or 11th magnitude, he would have seen it, having taken a plan of all the neighbouring small stars.\n\nThe next variable star in Mr Pigot's catalogue is the \u03b1 Antinoi, whose variation and period he discovered in 1785. From his corrected observations, he concludes that it continues at its greatest brightness 40 hours without decreasing; it is 66 hours after it begins to decrease before it comes to its full diminution; after which it continues stationary for 30 hours more, and then increases for 36 hours. In every period it seems to acquire its full brightness, and to be equally decreased.\n\nThe variable star in the Swan's Neck was observed for three years. The period of this star had been settled by Maraldi and Caffini at 405, and by M. le Gentil at 425.3 days; but from a mean of the observations of Mr Pigot, it appears to be only 392.\n\n\"Perhaps...\"\n\"Perhaps (says he) its period is irregular; to determine which several intervals of 15 years ought to be taken; and I am much inclined to believe that it will be found only 396 days 21 hours.\" The particulars relating to this star are, 1. When at its full brightness it undergoes no perceptible change for a fortnight. 2. It is about three months and a half in increasing from the 11th magnitude to its full brightness, and the same in decreasing; for which reason it may be considered as invisible during six months. 3. It does not always attain the same degree of lustre, being sometimes of the fifth and sometimes of the seventh magnitude.\n\nIn 1600, G. Jansoni discovered a variable star in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> of the Swan, which was afterwards observed by different astronomers, and supposed to have a period of about 10 years. The results of Mr Pigot's calculations from the observations of former astronomers are, 1. That it continues in full luster for five years. 2. It decreases rapidly for two years. 3. It is invisible to the naked eye for four years. 4. It increases slowly during seven years. 5. All these changes are completed in 18 years. 6. It was at its minimum at the end of the year 1663. 7. It does not always increase to the same degree of brightness, being sometimes of the third, and at others only of the fifth, magnitude.\n\n\"I am entirely ignorant (says Mr Pigot) whether it is subject to the same changes in this century, having not met with any series of observations on it; but if the above conjectures are right, it will be at its minimum in a very few years. Since November 1781 I have constantly seen it of the fifth magnitude. Sometimes I have suspected that it has decreased within these two last years, though in a very small degree.\"\n\nThe last star in Mr Pigot's first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> is the \u03b4 Cephei, whose variation was discovered by Mr Goodricke. Its changes are very difficult to be seen, unless it is observed at the times of its greatest and least brightness. The result of the observations hitherto made upon it are, that its period consists of 5 days 8 hours 37 minutes on a mean. The following observations relate to some stars of the second class.\n\n1. Hevelius's 6th Cassiopeiae was missing in 1782, nor could Mr Pigot find it in 1783 and 1784.\n\n2. \u03be or 46th Andromedae, said to be variable, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> is not convincing to Mr Pigot.\n\n3. Flamsteed's 50, 52, \u03c4 Andromedae, and Hevelius's 41 Andromedae. The position and characters of these stars differ considerably in different catalogues, and some of them are said by Caffini to have disappeared and reappeared. Mr Pigot therefore gives their comparative brightness as observed in the years 1783, 1784, and 1785, during which time he does not mention any particular change.\n\n4. Tycho's 20th Ceti. \"This (says Mr Pigot) must be the star which Hevelius said had disappeared, being Tycho's second in the Whale's Belly. There can hardly be any doubt that it is the \u03c7, misplaced by Tycho. This \u03c7 is of the fourth or fifth magnitude.\n\n5. \u03b5, or the 17th Eridani of Ptolemy and Ulug Beigh. Flamsteed says he could not see this star in 1691 and 1692; but in 1782, 1783, and 1784, Mr Pigot observed in that place one of the seventh magnitude, which appeared always of the same luster.\n\n6. Flamsteed's 41 Tauri was supposed by Caffini to be either a new or variable star; but Mr Pigot thinks there is no reason to be of that opinion. \"That it is not new (says he) is evident, since it is Ulug Beigh's 26th and Tycho's 43rd.\n\n7. A star about 2\u00bd north of 53 Eridani, and 47 Eridani. Caffini supposed the first of these stars to be a new one, and that it was not visible in 1664. He mentions another star thereabouts, which he also esteemed a new one.\n\n8. \u03b3 Canis Majoris. Maraldi could not see this star in 1670; but in 1692 and 1693 it appeared of the fourth magnitude. Mr Pigot made frequent observations upon it from 1782 to 1786, but could perceive no variation.\n\n9. \u03b1, \u03b2 Geminorum. \"If any of these stars (says our author) have changed in brightness, it is probably the \u03b2. In 1783, 1784, and 1785, the \u03b2 was undoubtedly brighter than \u03b1.\"\n\n10. \u00a7 Leonis. According to Montanari, this star was hardly visible in 1693. In 1783, 1784, and 1785, it was of the fifth magnitude. By Tycho, Flamsteed, Mayer, Bradley, &c., it is marked of the fourth.\n\n11. \u03c8 Leonis. This star is said to have disappeared before the year 1667; but according to Mr Pigot's observations, was constantly of the fifth or sixth magnitude since 1783.\n\n12. 25th Leonis. In 1783, our author first perceived that this star was missing, and could not perceive it in 1784 and 1785, even with a transit instrument.\n\n13. Bayer's i Leonis, or Tycho's 16 Leonis, was not visible in 1709, nor could it be seen in 1785. It is a different star from the i Leonis of the other catalogues, though Tycho's description of its place is the same.\n\n14. \u03c9 Ursae Majoris. This star is suspected to change in brightness, on account of its being marked by Tycho, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HESSE\">Hesse</a>, &c., of the second magnitude, while Hevelius, Bradley, and others, have marked it of the third. In 1786, and for three years before, it appeared as a bright star of the fourth magnitude.\n\n15. \u03bd Virginis. This is supposed to be variable, because Flamsteed, on the 27th of January 1680, could not see it; but he observed it in 1677, and some years afterwards. Mr Pigot observed it frequently in 1784 and 1785, and found it a star of the fifth magnitude without any perceptible change.\n\n16. Bayer's star of the fifth magnitude 10' south of g Virginis. \"This star (says Mr Pigot) is not in any of the nine Catalogues that I have. Maraldi looked for it in vain; and in May 1785 I could not see the least appearance of it.\" It certainly was not of the eighth magnitude.\n\n17. A star in the northern thigh of Virgo, marked by Ricciolus of the sixth magnitude, could not be seen by Maraldi in 1700; nor was it of the ninth magnitude, if at all visible in 1785.\n\n18. The 91 and 92 Virginis. In 1785, one of these stars, probably the 91, was missing: the remaining one is of the fifth or seventh magnitude.\n\n19. \u03b1 Draconis. Mr Pigot coincides in opinion with Dr Herschel, that this star is variable. Bradley, Flamsteed, &c., mark it of the second magnitude, but in 1786 it was only a bright fourth. It was frequently examined.\nexamined by Mr Pigot from the 4th of October 1782, but without any alteration being perceived.\n\n20. Bayer's star in the west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> of Libra. Maraldi could not see this star, and it was likewise invisible to Mr Pigot in 1784 and 1785.\n\n21. No 6 of Ptolemy and Ulug Beigh's uniformed in Libra. This star is not mentioned in any other catalogues than the above. Mr Pigot frequently observed a little star of the seventh magnitude very near its place.\n\n22. \u03be Librae. This star is thought to be variable, but Mr Pigot is not of that opinion, though certainly (says he) it is rather singular, that Hevelius, whose attention was directed to that part of the heavens to find Tycho's 11th, did not find the \u03be; and the more so, as he has noticed two much smaller stars not far from it. During these three years I have found the \u03be constantly of the fifth magnitude.\"\n\n23. Tycho's 11th Librae. Mr Pigot is of opinion that no such star as this ever existed; and that it is no other than the \u03be with an error of 2 degrees of longitude.\n\n24. 33 Serpentis. This star was missing in 1784; nor could it be perceived with a night-glass in 1785.\n\n25. A star marked by Bayer near \u03b7 Ursae majoris. This star could not be seen by Cassini; nor was Mr Pigot able to discover it with a night-glass in 1782.\n\n26. The 6, or Ptolemy and Ulug Beigh's 14th Ophiuchi, or Flamsteed's 36th. Mr Pigot has no doubt that this is the star which is said to have disappeared before the year 1695; and it is evident that it was not seen by Hevelius. In 1784 and 1785 Mr Pigot found it of the fourth or fifth magnitude; but he is far from being certain of its having undergone any change, especially as it has a southern declination of 26 degrees; for which reason great attention must be paid to the state of the atmosphere.\n\n27. Ptolemy's 13th and 18th Ophiuchi, fourth magnitude. Mr Pigot is of opinion that these stars are misplaced in the catalogues. The 18th of Ptolemy he thinks ought to be marked with a north latitude instead of a south, which would make it agree nearly with Flamsteed's 38th; and he is also of opinion that the 13th of Ptolemy is the 40th of Flamsteed.\n\n28. \u03bf Sagittarii. Dr Herchel, as well as Mr Pigot, is of opinion, that this star has probably changed its magnitude, though the reason seems only to be the great disagreement concerning it among the different catalogues of stars.\n\n29. \u03b7 Serpentis. This star, according to Mr Montanari, is of variable magnitude; but Mr Pigot never could perceive any alteration.\n\n30. Tycho's 27th Capricorni was missing in Hevelius's time, and Mr Pigot could not find it with a transit instrument.\n\n31. Tycho's 22d Andromedae, and \u03b7 Andromedae. Mr Cassini informs us, that in his time the former had grown so small that it could scarcely be seen; and Mr Pigot, that no star was to be seen in its place in 1784 and 1785; but he is of opinion that Cassini may have mistaken the \u03b7 Andromedae for the 22d; for which reason he observed this star three years, but without any alteration in its brightness.\n\n32. Tycho's 19th Aquarii. Hevelius says that this star was missing, and that Flamsteed could not see it with his naked eye in 1679. Mr Pigot could not see it in 1782; but is persuaded that it is the same with Flamsteed's 56th marked f by Bayer, from which it is only a degree and a half distant. The 53d of Flamsteed, marked f in Ptolemy's catalogue, is a different star.\n\n33. La Caille's 48 Aquarii was first discovered to be missing in 1778, and was not visible in 1783 and 1784.\n\nBesides these there are several others certainly variable, but which cannot be seen in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. There are some also suspected to be variable, but for which Mr Pigot thinks there is no reason. Dr Herchel also gives strong reasons for not laying great stress on all the observations by which new stars have been said to be discovered. Mr Pigot affirms us from repeated experience, that even more than a single observation, if not particularised and compared with neighbouring stars, is very little to be depended upon; different freaks of the clouds, the state of the weather, &c., having often caused him to err a whole magnitude in the brightness of a star.\n\nAs these changes to which the fixed stars are liable Wollaston's do not seem to be subject to any certain rule, Mr Wolaston has given an easy method of observing whether variations they do take place in any part of the heavens or not; and that without much expense of instruments or waste fixed stars of time, which are great objections to astronomical observations in general. His first idea was, that the work should be undertaken by astronomers in general; each taking a particular district of the heavens, and from time to time observing the right ascension and declination of every star in that space allotted to him, framing an exact map of it, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> their observations to one common place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>. This method, however, being too laborious, he next proposes the noting down at the time, or making a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> of what one sees while they are observing. A drawing of this kind once made, would remain, and could be consulted on any future occasion; and if done at first with care, a transient review would discover whether any sensible change had taken place since it was last examined, which could not so well be done by catalogues or verbal description. For this purpose he recommends the following method: \"To a night-glass, but of Dollond's construction, which magnifies about five times, and takes in about as many degrees of a great circle, I have added <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> wires intersecting one another at an angle of 45 degrees. More wires may be crossed in other directions; but I apprehend these will be sufficient. This telescope I mount on a polar axis. One coarsely made, and without any divisions on its circle of declination, will answer the purpose, as there is no great occasion for accuracy in that respect; but as the heavenly bodies are more readily followed by an equatorial motion of the telescope, so their relative positions are much more easily discerned when they are looked at constantly as in the same direction. A horizontal motion, except in the meridian, would be apt to mislead the judgment. It is scarcely necessary to add, that the wires must stand so as for one to describe a parallel of the equator nearly; another will then be a horary circle, and the whole area will be divided into eight equal sectors.\n\nThus prepared, the telescope is to be pointed to a known\nApparent known star, which is to be brought into the centre, or Motions of common interfection of all the wires. The relative positions of such other stars as appear within the field are to be judged by the eye; whether at \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), or \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) from the centre towards the circumference, or vice versa; and so forth regard to the nearest wire respectively. These, as one sees them, are to be noted down with a black-lead <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> upon a large mileage-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARD\">card</a> held in the hand, upon which a circle similarly divided is ready drawn. One of three inches diameter seems most convenient. The motion of the heavenly bodies in such a telescope is so slow, and the noting down of the stars so quickly done, that there is commonly full time for it without moving the telescope. When that is wanted, the principal star is easily brought back again into the centre of the field at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, and the work resumed. After a little practice, it is astonishing how near one can come to the truth in this way: and though neither the right ascensions nor the declinations are laid down by it, nor the distances between the stars measured; yet their apparent situations being preserved in black and white, with the day and year, and hour, if thought necessary, written underneath, each card then becomes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> of the then appearance of the heavens; which is easily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-examined at any time with little more than a transient view; and which will yet show, on the first glance, if there should have happened in it any alteration of consequence.\n\nFig. 80 shows part of the Corona Borealis delineated in this manner, and which was afterwards fully taken down by making the stars \\( \\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPHA\">alpha</a> \\), \\( \\beta \\), \\( \\gamma \\), \\( \\delta \\), \\( \\epsilon \\), \\( \\zeta \\), \\( \\theta \\), \\( \\iota \\), \\( \\kappa \\), \\( \\lambda \\), \\( \\mu \\), \\( \\nu \\), and \\( \\tau \\), successively central; and these were joined with some of the stars of Bootes, for the sake of connecting the whole, and united into one map, as represented fig. 81.\n\nIn observing in this way, it is evident, that the places of such stars as happen to be under or very near any of the wires, are more to be depended upon than those which are in the intermediate spaces, especially if towards the edges of the fields; so also those which are nearest to the centre, because better defined, and more within the reach of one wire or another. For this reason, different stars of the same set must successively be made central, or brought towards one of the wires, where any suspicion arises of a mistake, in order to approach nearer to a certainty; but if the stand of the telescope be tolerably well adjusted and fixed, this is soon done.\n\nIn such a glass it is seldom that light sufficient for discerning the wires is wanting. When an illuminator is required, a piece of card or white pasteboard projecting on one side beyond the tube, and which may be brought forward occasionally, is better than any other. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> across a small segment of the object-glass, it throws a sufficient light down the tube through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> be at a great distance, and one may lose sight of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> glare by drawing back the head, and moving the eye a little to one side, when the small stars will be seen as if no illuminator was there. See a delineation of the principal fixed stars, with the apparent path of the sun among them, in figures 82 and 83.\n\nA very remarkable appearance in the heavens is that called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GALAXY\">galaxy</a>, or milky-way. This is a broad circle, sometimes double, but for the most part single, surrounding the whole celestial concave. We perceive also in different parts of the heavens small white spots, which appear to be of the same nature with the milky-way. These spots are called nebul\u00e6.\n\nWe shall subjoin in this place, for the entertainment of the reader, the theories of Mr Michell and Dr Herschel, concerning the nature and position of the fixed stars.\n\n\"The very great number of stars (says Mr Mr Mitchell) that have been discovered to be double, triple, shell's conjectures &c., particularly by Mr Herschel, if we apply the doctrine of chances, as I have heretofore done in my inquiry into the probable parallax, &c., of the fixed stars, of the fixed stars published in the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1767, cannot leave a doubt with any one who is properly acquainted with the force of those arguments, that by far the greatest part, if not all of them, are systems of stars so near each other, as probably to be liable to be affected sensibly by their mutual gravitation; and it is therefore not unlikely, that the periods of the revolutions of some of these about their principals (the smaller ones being, upon this hypothesis, to be considered as satellites to the other) may some time or other be discovered.\" Having then thrown in what manner the magnitude of a fixed star, if its density were known, would affect the velocity of its light, he concludes at last, that \"if the semidiameter of a sphere in what proportion of 500 to 1, a body falling from an infinite height towards it (or moving in a parabolic curve at its surface) would have acquired a greater velocity than that of light; and consequently, supposing that emits light to be attracted by the same force in proportion to its vis inertiae with other bodies, all light emitted from such a body would be made to return towards it by its own proper gravity. But if the semidiameter of a sphere, of the same density with the sun, was of any other size less than 497 times that of the sun, though the velocity of light emitted by such a body would never be wholly destroyed, yet it would always suffer some diminution, more or less according to the magnitude of the sphere. The same effects would likewise take place if the semidiameters were different from those already mentioned, provided the density was greater or less in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUPLICATE\">duplicate</a> ratio of the semidiameters inversely.\n\nAfter proceeding in his calculations, in order to find Comparative brightness of the fixed stars, he proceeds thus: \"According to Mr Bouguer the brightness of the sun exceeds that of a wax candle in no less a proportion than that of 8000 to 1. If therefore the brightness of any of the fixed stars should not exceed that of our common candles, which, as being something less luminous than wax, we suppose in round numbers to be only one ten thousandth part as bright as the sun, such a star would not be visible at more than one hundredth part of the distance at which it would be seen if it were as bright as the sun. Now, because the sun would still, I apprehend, appear as bright and luminous as the star Sirius, if removed to 400,000 times its present distance, such a body, if no brighter than our common candles, would only appear equally luminous with that star at 4000 times the distance of the sun; and we might then be able, with the best telescopes, to distinguish some sensible appearance...\"\nApparent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> diameter of it; but the apparent diameters of the stars of lesser magnitudes would still be too small to be distinguished even with our best telescopes, unless they were yet a good deal less luminous; which may possibly, however, be the case with some of them: for though we have indeed very slight grounds to go upon with regard to the specific brightness of the fixed stars, compared with that of the sun at present, and can therefore form only very uncertain and random conjectures concerning it; yet from the infinite variety which we find in the works of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>, it is not unreasonable to suppose, that very possibly some of the fixed stars may have so little natural brightness in proportion to their magnitude, as to admit of their diameters having some sensible apparent size when they shall come to be more carefully examined, and with larger and better telescopes than have been hitherto in common use.\n\n\"With respect to the sun, we know that his whole surface is extremely luminous, a very small and temporary interruption sometimes, from a few spots, excepted. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> and excessive brightness of the whole surface is probably owing to an atmosphere, which being luminous throughout, and in some measure also transparent, the light proceeding from a considerable depth of it, all arrives at the eye, in the same manner as the light of a great number of candles would do if they were placed one behind another, and their flames were sufficiently transparent to permit the light of the more distant ones to pass through those that were nearer without interruption.\n\n\"How far the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> may take place in the fixed stars we do not know; probably, however, it may still do so in many; but there are some appearances, with regard to a few of them, which seem to make it probable that it does not do so universally. Now, if I am right in supposing the light of the sun to proceed from a luminous atmosphere which must necessarily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a> itself equally over the whole surface, and I think there can be very little doubt that this is really the case, this constitution cannot well take place in those stars which are in some degree periodically more and less luminous, such as that in Collo Ceti, &c. It is also not very improbable, that there is some difference from that of the sun in the constitution of those stars which have sometimes appeared and disappeared, of which that in the constellation of Cassiopeia is a notable instance. And if these conjectures are well founded which have been formed by some philosophers concerning stars of this kind, that they are not wholly luminous, or at least not constantly so, but that all, or by far the greatest part of their surfaces, is subject to considerable changes, sometimes becoming luminous, at other times extinguished; it is amongst stars of this sort that we are most likely to meet with instances of a sensible apparent diameter, their light being much more likely not to be so great in proportion as that of the sun, which if removed to 400,000 times his present distance, would still appear, I apprehend, as bright as Sirius, as I have observed above; whereas it is hardly to be expected, with any body of the heavens whatever, that we should ever be able to distinguish a well-defined disk of any body of the same size with the sun at much more than 10,000 times his present distance.\n\n\"Hence the greatest distance at which it would be possible to distinguish any sensible apparent diameter of a body as dense as the sun, cannot well greatly exceed five hundred times ten thousand; that is, five million times the distance of the sun; for if the diameter of such a body was not less than 500 times that of the sun, its light, as has been shown above, could never arrive at us.\"\n\nDr Herschel, improving on Mr Mitchell's idea of Dr Herschel's observations, on which this theory is founded, were made with a Newtonian reflector of 20 feet focal length, and an aperture of 18 inches.\n\nBy this word we are to understand the apparent space in the heavens he could see at once through his telescope.\nminutes for the diameter of his field of view, a belt of 15 degrees long and two broad, which he had often seen pass before his telescope in an hour's time, could not contain less than 50,000 stars, large enough to be distinctly numbered; besides which, he suspected twice as many more, which could be seen only now and then by faint glimpses for want of sufficient light.\n\nThe success he had within the milky-way soon induced him to turn his telescope to the nebulous parts of the heavens, of which an accurate list had been published in the *Connoissance des Temps* for 1783 and 1784. Most of these yielded to a Newtonian reflector of 20 feet focal distance and 12 inches aperture; which plainly discovered them to be composed of stars, or at least to contain stars, and to show every other indication of confining them entirely. \"The nebula (says he) are arranged into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a>, and run on to a great length; and some of them I have been able to pursue, and to guess pretty well at their form and direction. It is probable enough that they may surround the whole starry sphere of the heavens, not unlike the milky-way, which undoubtedly is nothing but a stratum of fixed stars: And as this latter immense starry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BED\">bed</a> is not of equal breadth or lustre in every part, nor runs on in one straight direction, but is curved, and even divided into two streams along a very considerable portion of it; we may likewise expect the greatest variety in the strata of the clusters of stars and nebul\u00e6. One of these nebul\u00e6s is so rich, that, in passing through a section of it in the time of only 35 minutes, I have detected no less than 31 nebul\u00e6, all distinctly visible upon a fine blue sky. Their situation and shape, as well as condition, seem to denote the greatest variety imaginable. In another stratum, or perhaps a different branch of the former, I have often seen double and treble nebul\u00e6 variously arranged; large ones with small seeming attendants; narrow, but much extended lucid nebul\u00e6 or bright dashes; some of the shape of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAN\">fan</a>, resembling an electric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> issuing from a lucid point; others of the cometic shape, with a seeming nucleus in the centre, or like cloudy stars, surrounded with a nebulous atmosphere: a different fort again contain a nebulosity of the milky kind, like that wonderful inexplicable phenomenon about \u03b4 Orionis; while others shine with a fainter mottled kind of light, which denotes their being resolvable into stars.\n\n\"It is very probable that the great stratum called the milky-way, is that in which the sun is placed, though perhaps not in the very centre of its thickness. We gather this from the appearance of the galaxy, which seems to encompass the whole heavens, as it certainly must do if the sun is within the same. For suppose a number of stars arranged between two parallel planes, indefinitely extended every way, but at a given considerable distance from one another, and calling this a sidereal stratum, an eye placed somewhere within it will see all the stars in the direction of the planes of the stratum projected into a great circle, which will appear lucid on account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> of the stars, while the rest of the heavens at the sides will only seem to be scattered over with constellations, more or less crowded according to the distance of the planes or number of stars contained in the thickness or sides of the stratum.\n\nVol. III. Part I.\n\n\"Thus in fig. 83, an eye at S within the stratum Apparent ab, will see the stars in the direction of its length ab, Motions of or height ed, with all those in the intermediate sidereal Bodies, projected into the lucid circle ARCD; while those in the sides m e, n w, will be seen scattered over the remaining part of the heavens at MVNW.\n\n\"If the eye were placed somewhere without the celestial stratum, at no very great distance, the appearance of the stars within it would assume the form of one of the concentric circles of the sphere, which would be more or less contracted to the distance of the eye; and if this hypothesis were exceedingly increased, the whole stratum might at last be drawn together into a lucid spot of any shape, according to the position, length, and height of the stratum.\n\n\"Let us now suppose, that a branch or smaller stratum should run out from the former in a certain direction, and let it also be contained between two parallel planes extended indefinitely onwards, but so that the eye may be placed in the great stratum somewhere before the separation, and not far from the place where the strata are still united; then will this second stratum not be projected into a bright circle like the former, but will be seen as a lucid branch proceeding from the first, and returning to it again at a certain distance less than a semicircle. Thus, in the same figure, the stars in the small stratum p g will be projected into a bright arch at PRRP, which after its separation from the circle CBD, unites with it again at P.\n\n\"What has been intimated in parallel planes may easily be applied to strata irregularly bounded, and running in various directions; for their projection will of consequence vary according to the quantities of the variations in the strata and the distance of the eye from the same. And thus any kind of curvatures, as well as various degrees of brightness, may be produced in the projections.\n\n\"From appearances, then, as I observed before, we may infer, that the sun is most likely placed in one of the great strata of the fixed stars, and very probably not far from the place where some smaller stratum branches out from it. Such a supposition will satisfactorily, and with great simplicity, account for all the phenomena of the milky-way; which according to this hypothesis, is no other than the appearance of the projection of the stars contained in this stratum and its secondary branch. As a farther inducement to look on the galaxy in this point of view, let it be considered, that we can no longer doubt of its whitish appearance arising from the mixed lustre of the numberless stars that compose it. Now, should we suppose it to be an irregular ring of stars, in the centre nearly of which we must then suppose the sun to be placed, it will appear not a little extraordinary, that the sun, being a fixed star, like those which compose this imaginary ring, should just be in the centre of such a multitude of celestial bodies, without any apparent reason for this singular distinction; whereas, on our supposition, every star in this stratum, not very near the termination of its length or height, will be so placed as also to have its own galaxy, with only such variations in the form and lustre of it as may arise from the particular situation of each star.\n\n\"Various methods may be taken to come to a knowledge of the sun's place in the sidereal stratum, heavens.\none of which I have already begun to put in practice: I call it gauging the heavens; or the star-gauge. It consists in repeatedly taking the number of stars in ten fields of view of my reflector very near each other; and by adding their sums, and cutting off one decimal on the right, a mean of the contents of the heavens in all the parts which are thus gauged are obtained. Thus it appears that the number of stars increases very much as we approach the milky-way; for in the parallel from 92 to 94 degrees north polar distance, and right ascension 15 h. 10', the star-gauge runs up from 9-4 stars in the field to 18-6 in about an hour and a half; whereas in the parallel from 78 to 80 degrees north polar distance, and R. A. 11, 12, 13, and 14 hours, it very seldom rises above 4. We are, however, to remember, that, with different instruments, the account of the gauges will be very different, especially on our supposition of the sun in a stratum of stars. For let \\(a, b\\), fig. 84, be the stratum, and suppose the small circle \\(g, h, k\\) to represent the space into which, by the light and power of a given telescope, we are enabled to penetrate, and let GHILK be the extent of another portion which we are enabled to visit by means of a larger aperture and power, it is evident, that the gauges with the latter instrument will differ very much in their account of stars contained at MN and at KG or LH, when with the former they will hardly be affected with the change from \\(m, n\\) to \\(k, g\\) or \\(l, k\\).\n\n\"The situation of the sun in the sidereal stratum will be found by conferring in what manner the star-gauge agrees with the length of a ray revolving in several directions about an assumed point, and cut off by the bounds of the stratum. Thus, in fig. 85, let S be the place of an observer: \\(S r, r, r, r, r\\), lines in the plane \\(S r, r, r, r\\), drawn from S within the stratum to one of the boundaries here represented by the plane AB. Then, since neither the situation of S nor the form of the limiting surface AB is known, we are to assume a point, and apply to it lines proportional to the several gauges that have been obtained, and at such angles from each other as they may point out: then will the termination of these lines delineate the boundary of the stratum, and consequently manifest the situation of the sun within the same.\n\n\"In my late observations on nebulae, I soon found, that I generally detected them in certain directions rather than in others: that the spaces preceding them were generally quite deprived of their stars, so as often to afford many fields without a single star in it: that the nebulae generally appeared some time after among stars of a certain considerable size, and but seldom among very small stars: that when I came to one nebula, I generally found several more in the neighbourhood: that afterwards a considerable time passed before I came to another parcel. These events being often repeated in different altitudes of my instrument, and some of them at considerable distances from each other, it occurred to me that the intermediate spaces between the sweeps might also contain nebulae; and finding this to hold good more than once, I ventured to give notice to my assistant at the clock, that 'I found myself on nebulous ground.' But how far these circumstances of vacant places preceding and following the nebulous strata, and their being as it were contained in a bed of stars sparingly scattered between them, may hold good in more distant portions of the heavens, and which I have not been yet able to visit in any regular manner, I ought by no means to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAZARD\">hazard</a> a conjecture. I may venture, however, to add a few particulars about the direction of some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> strata or their branches. The well-known nebula of Cancer, visible Direction to the naked eye, is probably one belonging to a certain stratum, in which I suppose it to be so placed as to paltrily nearest to us. This stratum I shall call that of stars. Cancer. It runs from \\(a\\) Cancri towards the south, over the 67th nebula of the Connoissance des Temps, which is a very beautiful and pretty much compressed clutter of stars, easily to be seen by any good telescope; and in which I have observed above 200 stars at once in the field of view of my great reflector with a power of 157. This clutter appearing so plainly with any good common telescope, and being so near to the one which may be seen with the naked eye, denotes it to be probably the next in distance to that within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTILE\">quartile</a> formed by \\(y, z, n, d\\). From the 67th nebula the stratum of Cancer proceeds towards the head of Hydra; but I have not yet had time to trace it farther than the equator.\n\n\"Another stratum, which perhaps approaches nearer to the solar system than any of the rest, and whose situation is nearly at rectangles with the great sidereal stratum in which the sun is placed, is that of Coma Berenices, as I shall call it. I suppose the Coma itself to be one of the clutters in it, and that on account of its nearness it appears to be so scattered. It has many capital nebulae very near it: and in all probability this stratum runs out a very considerable way. It may perhaps even make the circuit of the heavens, though very likely not in one of the great circles of the sphere; for unless it should chance to intersect the great sidereal stratum of the milky-way before mentioned, in the very place in which the sun is stationed, such an appearance would hardly be produced. However, if the stratum of Coma Berenices should extend so far as I apprehend it may, the direction of it towards the north lies probably, with some windings, through the Great Bear onwards to Cassiopeia, thence through the girdle of Andromeda and the Northern Fifth, proceeding towards Cetus; while towards the south it passes through the Virgin, probably on to the tail of Hydra and Centaurus.\"\n\nBy a continued series of observations, Dr Herschel became confirmed in his notions; and in a succeeding paper * has given a sketch of his opinions concerning the interior construction of the heavens. \"That the truest milky-way (says he) is a most extensive stratum of vol. 75, stars of various sizes, admits no longer of the least doubt; and that our sun is one of the heavenly bodies belonging to it is evident. I have now viewed and gauged this thinning zone in almost every direction, and the heavens find it composed of thinning stars, whose number, by tens, the account of those gauges, constantly increases and decreases in proportion to its apparent brightness to the naked eye. But in order to develop the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of the universe that have been fugitively by my late observations, it will be best to take the subject from a point of view at a considerable distance both of space and time.\n\n\"Let us then suppose numberless stars of various sizes scattered over an indefinite portion of space, in such\nApparent such a manner as to be almost equally distributed through the whole. The laws of attraction, which no doubt extend to the remotest regions of the fixed stars, will operate in such a manner as most probably to produce the following remarkable effects.\n\n\"I. It will frequently happen, that a star, being considerably larger than its neighbouring ones, will attract them more than they will be attracted by others that are immediately around them; by which means they will be in time, as it were, condensed about a centre; or, in other words, form themselves into a clutter of stars of almost a globular figure, more or less regularly so according to the size and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> distance of the surrounding stars. The perturbations of these mutual attractions must undoubtedly be very intricate, as we may easily comprehend, by considering what Sir Isaac Newton has said, *Principia*, lib. i. prop. 38. et seq.; but in order to apply this great author's reasoning of bodies moving in ellipses to such as are here for a while supposed to have no other motion than what their mutual gravity has imparted to them, we must suppose the conjugate axes of these ellipses indefinitely diminished, whereby the ellipses will become straight lines.\n\n\"II. The next case, which will happen almost as frequently as the former, is where a few stars, though not superior in size to the rest, may change to be rather nearer each other than the surrounding ones; for here also will be formed a prevailing attraction in the combined centre of gravity of them all, which will occasion the neighbouring stars to draw together; not, indeed, so as to form a regular globular figure, but, however, in such a manner as to be condensed towards the common centre of gravity of the whole irregular cluster. And this construction admits of the utmost variety of shapes, according to the number and situation of the stars which first gave rise to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDENSATION\">condensation</a> of the rest.\n\n\"III. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> and repeated conjunction of both the foregoing forms, a third may be derived, when many large stars, or combined small ones, are situated in long extended regular or crooked rows, hooks, or branches; for they will also draw the surrounding ones so as to produce figures of condensed stars coarsely similar to the former, which gave rise to these condensations.\n\n\"IV. We may likewise admit of still more extensive combinations; when, at the same time that a cluster of stars is forming in one part of space, there may be another collecting in a different, but perhaps not far distant, quarter, which may occasion a mutual approach towards their common centre of gravity.\n\n\"V. In the last place, as a natural consequence of the former cases, there will be great cavities or vacancies formed by the retreat of the stars towards the various centres which attract them; so that, upon the whole, there is evidently a field of the greatest variety for the mutual and combined attractions of the heavenly bodies to exert themselves in.\n\n\"From this theoretical view of the heavens, which has been taken from a point not less distant in time than in space, we will now retreat to our own retired station, in one of the planets attending a star in its great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> with numberless others: and in order to investigate what will be the appearances from this contracted situation, let us begin with the naked eye. The flares of the first magnitude, being in all probability the nearest, will furnish us with a step to begin the Heavenly Bodies. Setting off, therefore, with the distance of Sirius or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCTURUS\">Arcturus</a>, for instance, as unity, we will at present suppose, that those of the second magnitude how the are at double, those of the third at treble, the distance appear to &c. Taking it for granted, then, that a star of the seventh magnitude (the smallest supposed visible withing to this the naked eye) is about seven times as far as one of the first, it follows, that an observer who is enclosed in a globular cluster of stars, and not far from the centre, will never be able with the naked eye to see to the end of it; for since, according to the above estimations, he can only extend his view to above seven times the distance of Sirius, it cannot be expected that his eyes should reach the borders of a clutter which has perhaps not less than 50 stars in depth everywhere around him. The whole universe to him, therefore, will be comprised in a set of constellations richly ornamented with scattered stars of all sizes: Or, if the united brightness of a neighbouring clutter of stars should, in a remarkable clear night, reach his sight, it will put on the appearance of a small, faint, whitish, nebulous cloud, not to be perceived without the greatest attention. Let us suppose him placed in a much extended stratum or branching clutter of millions of flares, such as may fall under the third form of nebulae already considered. Here also the heavens will not only be richly scattered over with brilliant constellations, but a thinning zone or milky-way will be perceived to surround the whole sphere of the heavens, owing to the combined light of these stars which are too small, that is, too remote to be seen. Our observer's sight will be confined, that he will imagine this single collection of stars, though he does not even perceive the thousandth part of them, to be the whole contents of the heavens. Allowing him now the use of a common telescope, he begins to suspect that all the milkiness of the bright path which surrounds the sphere may be owing to flares. He perceives a few clutters of them in various parts of the heavens, and finds also that there are a kind of nebulous patches: but still his views are not extended to reach so far as to the end of the stratum in which he is situated; so that he looks upon these patches as belonging to that system which to him seems to comprehend every celestial object. He now increases his power of vision; and, applying himself to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> observation, finds that the milky-way is indeed no other than a collection of very small flares. He perceives, that those objects which had been called nebulae, are evidently nothing but clutters of stars. Their number increases upon him; and when he resolves one nebula into flares, he discovers ten new ones which he cannot resolve. He then forms the idea of immense strata of fixed flares, of clutters of flares, and of nebulae; till, going on with such interesting observations, he now perceives, that all these appearances must naturally arise from the confined situation in which we are placed. Confined it may justly be called, though in no less a space than what appeared before to be the whole region of the fixed stars, but which now has assumed the shape of a crookedly branching nebula; not indeed one of the least, but perhaps very far from being the most considerable, of those numberless\nApparent numberless clusters that enter into the construction of the heavens.\"\n\nOur author now proceeds to show that this theoretical view of the heavens is perfectly consistent with facts, and seems to be confirmed by a series of observations.\n\nArguments Many hundreds of nebulae of the first and second forms are to be seen in the heavens; and their places, he goes on to say, will hereafter be pointed out; many of the third form described, and instances of the fourth related; a few of the cavities mentioned in the fifth particularized, though many more have been already observed: so that, \"upon the whole (says he), I believe it will be found, that the foregoing theoretical view, with all its consequential appearances, as seen by an eye enclosed in one of the nebulae, is no other than a drawing from nature, wherein the features of the original have been closely copied: and I hope the resemblance will not be called a bad one, when it shall be considered how very limited must be the pencil of an inhabitant of so small and retired a portion of an indefinite system in attempting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of so unbounded an extent.\"\n\nDr Herschel next presents us with a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> of star-gauges, or accounts of the number of stars at once in the field of his telescope, which go as high as 588; after which he proposes the following\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROBLEM\">Problem</a>.**\n\n\"The stars being supposed nearly equally scattered, and their number, in a field of view of a known angular diameter, being given; to determine the length of the visual ray.\n\n\"Here, the arrangement of the stars not being fixed upon, we must endeavour to find which way they may be placed so as to fill a given space most equitably. Suppose a rectangular cone cut into frustums by many equidistant planes perpendicular to the axis; then, if one star be placed at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a> and another in the axis at the first intersection, six stars may be let around it so as to be equally distant from one another and from the central star. These positions being carried on in the same manner, we shall have every star within the cone surrounded by eight others at an equal distance from that star taken as a centre. Fig. 100. contains four sections of such a cone distinguished by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> shades; which will be sufficient to explain what sort of arrangement I would point out.\n\n\"The series of the number of stars contained in the several sections will be 1, 7, 19, 37, 61, 91, &c., which continued to \\( n \\) terms, the sum of it, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENTIAL\">differential</a> method, will be \\( na + \\frac{n-1}{2}d + \\frac{n-1}{2}d'' + \\cdots + d^n \\), &c., where \\( a \\) is the first term, \\( d', d'', d''', &c. \\), the first, second, and third differences. Then, since \\( a = 1, d' = 6, d'' = 6, d''' = 0 \\), the sum of the series will be \\( n^3 \\).\n\nLet \\( S \\) be the given number of stars; \\( r \\) the diameter of the base of the field of view; and \\( B \\) the diameter of the great rectangular cone; and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">trigonometry</a> we shall have \\( B = \\frac{S}{\\text{Tang. } \\frac{r}{2}} \\).\n\nNow, since the field of view of a telescope is a cone, we shall have its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a> to that of the great cone of the stars formed by the above construction, as the square of the diameter of the base of the field of view, to the square of the diameter of the great cone, the height of both being the same; and the stars in each cone being in the ratio of the solidity, as being equally scattered, we have \\( n = \\sqrt{\\frac{B^2S}{r^2}} \\), which was to be determined.\"\n\nAnother solution of this problem on the supposition of another arrangement of stars, is given; but Dr Herschel prefers the former.\n\nFrom the data now laid down, Dr Herschel next proves of endeavours to prove that the earth is 'the planet of our sidereal star belonging to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> nebula of the third system.'\n\n\"I shall now (says he) proceed to show, that in the stupendous sidereal system we inhabit, this extensive stratum, and its secondary branch, consisting of many millions of stars, is in all probability a detached nebula.\n\nIn order to go upon grounds that seem to me to be capable of great certainty, they being no less than an actual survey of the boundaries of our sidereal system, which I have plainly perceived as far as I have yet gone round it, everywhere terminated, and in most places very narrowly too, it will be proper to show the length of my founding line, if I may call it, that it may appear whether it was sufficiently long for the purpose.\n\n\"In the most crowded parts of the milky-way, I have had fields of view that contained no fewer than the line by 588 stars, and these were continued for many minutes which Dr Herschel notes: so that in one quarter of an hour's time there measures passed no less than 116,000 stars through the field of the head of my telescope. Now, if we compute the length of the visual ray, by putting \\( S = 588 \\), and the diameter of the field of view 15 minutes, we shall find \\( n = \\sqrt{\\frac{B^2S}{r^2}} = 498 \\); so that it appears the length of what I have called my Sounding Line, or \\( n - 1 \\), was not probably less than 497 times the distance of Sirius from the sun.\n\n\"It may seem inaccurate that we should find an argument on the stars being equally scattered, when, in all probability, there may not be any two of them in the heavens whose mutual distance shall be equal to that of any other two given stars: but it should be considered, that when we take all the stars collectively, there will be a mean distance which may be assumed as the general one; and an argument founded on such a supposition will have in its favour the greatest probability of not being far short of truth. And here I Cluter must observe, that the difference between a crowded stars deplace and a clutter (none of the latter being put into fine, the gauge table), may easily be perceived by the arrangement as well as the size and mutual distance of the stars; for in a clutter they are generally not only resembling each other pretty nearly in size, but a certain uniformity of distance also takes place: they are more and more accumulated towards the centre, and put on all the appearances which we should naturally expect from a number of them collected into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> at a certain distance from us. On the other hand, the rich parts of the milky-way, as well as those in the distant broad parts of the stratum, consist of a mixture of stars of all possible sizes, that are seemingly placed without any particular apparent order. Perhaps we might recollect, that a greater condensation towards the centre of our system than towards the borders of it should be taken into consideration; but with a nebula of the third form containing such various and extensive combinations...\"\nbinations as I have found to take place in ours, this circumstance, which in one of the first form would be of considerable moment, may, I think, be safely neglected.\n\n\"If some other high gauge be selected from the table, such as 472 or 344, the length of the visual ray will be found 461 and 415. And although, in consequence of what has been said, a certain degree of doubt may be left about the arrangement and scattering of the stars, yet when it is recollected, that in those parts of the milky-way, where these high gauges were taken, the stars were neither so small nor so crowded as they must have been, on a supposition of a much farther continuance of them, when certainly a milky or nebulous appearance must have come on, I need not fear to have over-rated the extent of my visual ray; and indeed everything that can be said to shorten it will only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> the limits of our nebula, as it has in most places been of sufficient length to go far beyond the bounds of it. Thus in the sides of our stratum, opposite to our situation in it, where the gauges often run below 5, our nebula cannot extend to 100 times the distance of Sirius; and the same telescope which could show 588 stars in a field of view of 15 minutes, must certainly have presented me also with the stars in these situations, had they been there. If we should answer this by observing, that they might be at too great a distance to be perceived, it will be allowing that there must at least be a vacancy amounting to the length of a visual ray, not short of 400 times the distance of Sirius; and this is amply sufficient to make our nebula a detached one. It is true, that it would not be confident confidently to affirm that we were on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, unless we had found ourselves everywhere bounded by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>; and therefore I shall go no farther than the gauges will authorize; but considering the little depth of the stratum in all those places which have been actually gauged, to which must be added all the intermediate parts that have been viewed and found to be much like the rest, there is but little room to expect a connection between our nebula and any of the neighbouring ones. A telescope, with a much larger aperture than my present one, grasping together a greater quantity of light, and thereby enabling us to see farther into space, will be the surest means of completing and establishing the arguments that have been used: for if our nebula is not absolutely a detached one, I am firmly persuaded that an instrument may be made large enough to discover the places where the stars continue onwards. A very bright milky nebulosity must there undoubtedly come on, since the stars in a field of view will increase in the ratio of $n^3$ greater than that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a> of the visual ray. Thus, if 588 stars in a given field of view are to be seen by a ray of 497 times the distance of Sirius, when this is lengthened to 1000, which is but little more than double the former, the number of stars in the same field of view will be no less than 4774; for when the visual ray $r$ is given, the number of stars $S$ will be $\\frac{n^3}{15^2}$; where $n = r + \\frac{1}{4}$; and a telescope with a threefold power of extending into space, or with a ray of 1500, which I think may easily be constructed, will give us 16,096 stars. Nor would these be so close, but that a good power applied to such an instrument might easily distinguish them; for they need not, if arranged in regular squares, approach nearer to each other than 6\u00b0.275; but the milky nebulosity I have mentioned, would be produced by the numberless stars beyond, which, in one respect, the visual ray might also be said to reach. To make this appear, we must return to the naked eye: which, as we have before estimated, can only see the stars of the seventh magnitude so as to distinguish them: but it is nevertheless very evident, that the united lustre of millions of stars, such as I suppose the nebula in Andromeda to be, will reach our sight in the shape of a very small faint nebulosity; since the nebula of which I speak may easily be seen in a fine evening. In the same manner, my present telescope, as I have argued, has not only a visual ray that will reach the stars at 497 times the distance of Sirius, so as to distinguish them, and probably much farther, but also a power of showing the united lustre of the accumulated stars that compose a milky nebulosity at a distance far exceeding the former limits: so that from these considerations it appears again highly probable, that my present telescope not showing such a nebulosity in the milky-way, goes already far beyond its extent; and consequently much more would an instrument, such as I have mentioned, remove all doubt on the subject, both by showing the stars in the continuation of the stratum, and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> a very strong milky nebulosity beyond them, that could no longer be mistaken for the dark ground of the heavens.\n\n\"To these arguments, which rest on the firm basis of a series of observation, we may add the following arguments drawn from analogy. Among the great number of nebulae which I have now already seen, amounting to more than 900, there are many which in all probability are equally extensive with that which we inhabit; and yet they are all separated from each other by very considerable intervals. Some, indeed, there are that seem to be double and treble; and though, with most of these it may be that they are at a very great distance from each other, yet we allow that some such conjunctions really are to be found; nor is this what we mean to exclude: But then these compound or double nebulae, which are those of the third and fourth forms, still make a detached link in the great chain. It is also to be supposed, that there may be some thinly scattered solitary stars between the large interfaces of nebulae; which being situated so as to be nearly equally attracted by the several clusters when they were forming, remain unassociated: and though we cannot expect to see these stars on account of their vast distance, yet we may well presume that their number cannot be very considerable in comparison to those that are already drawn into systems; which conjecture is also abundantly confirmed in situations where the nebulae are near enough to have their stars visible; for they are all inflated, and generally to be seen upon a very clear and pure ground, without any star near them that might be thought to belong to them. And though I have often seen them in beds of stars, yet from the size of these latter we may be certain, that they were much nearer to us than those nebulae, and belong undoubtedly to our own system.\"\n\nHaving thus determined that the visible system of nature, by us called the universe, consisting of all the celestial bodies,\nApparent celestial bodies, and many more than can be seen by the naked eye, is only a group of stars or suns with their planets, constituting one of those patches called a nebula, and perhaps not one ten-thousandth part of what is really the universe, Dr Herschel goes on to delineate the figure of this vast nebula, which he is of opinion may now be done; and for this purpose he gives a table, calculating the distances of the stars which form its extreme boundaries, or the length of the visual ray in different parts, by the number of stars contained in the field of his telescope at different times, according to the principles already laid down. He does not, however, as yet attempt the whole nebula, but of a particular section, represented fig. 160. \"I have taken one (says he) which passes through the poles of our system, and is at right angles to the conjunction of the branches, which I have called its length. The name of poles seems to me not improperly applied to those points which are 90 degrees distant from a circle passing along the milky-way; and the north pole is here supposed to be situated in right ascension 18\u00b050', and polar distance (that is from the pole commonly so called) 58\u00b0. The section is one which makes an angle of 35\u00b0 with our equator, crossing it in 124\u00b030' and 324\u00b030'. A celestial globe, adjusted to the latitude of 55\u00b0 north, and having \u03b5 Ceti near the meridian, will have the plane of this section pointed out by the horizon. The visual rays are to be projected on the plane of the horizon of the latitude just mentioned, which may be done accurately enough by a globe adjusted in the manner directed. The stars in the border, which are marked larger than the rest, are those pointed out by the gauges. The intermediate parts are filled up by smaller stars, arranged in straight lines between the gauged ones. From this figure, which I hope is not a very inaccurate one, we may see that our nebula, as we observed before, is of the third form; that is, a very extensive, branching, compound <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGERIES\">congeries</a> of many millions of stars, which most probably owes its origin to many remarkably large, as well as pretty closely scattered, small stars, that may have drawn together the rest. Now, to have some idea of the wonderful extent of this system, I must observe, that this section of it is drawn upon a scale where the distance of Sirius is no more than the 80th part of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a>; so that probably all the stars, which in the finest nights we are able to distinguish with the naked eye, may be comprehended within a sphere drawn round the large star near the middle, representing our situation in the nebula of less than half a quarter of an inch radius.\"\n\nDr Herschel now proceeds to offer some further thoughts on the origin of the nebulous strata of the heavens: in doing which he gives some hints concerning the antiquity of them. \"If it were possible (says he) to distinguish between the parts of an indefinitely extended whole, the nebula we inhabit might be said to be one that has fewer marks of antiquity than any of the rest. To explain this idea perhaps more clearly, we should recollect, that the condensation of clusters of stars has been ascribed to a gradual approach; and whoever reflects on the number of ages that must have passed before some of the clusters that are to be found in my intended catalogue of them could be so far condensed as we find them at present, will not wonder if I ascribe a certain air of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a> and vigour to many very regularly scattered regions of our sidereal stratum. There are, moreover, many places in it in which, if we may judge from appearances, there is the greatest reason to believe that the stars are drawing towards secondary centres, and will in time separate into clutters, so of the density as to occasion many subdivisions. Hence we may surmise, that when a nebulous stratum consists chiefly of nebulae of the first and second forms, it probably owes its origin to what may be called the decay of a great compound nebula of the third form; and that the subdivisions which happened to it in length of time, occasioned all the small nebulae which sprung from it to lie in a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a>, according as they were detached from the primary one. In like manner, our system, after numbers of ages, may very possibly become divided, so as to give rise to a stratum of two or three hundred nebulae; for it would not be difficult to point out so many beginning or gathering clutters in it. This throws a considerable light upon that remarkable collection of many hundreds of nebulae which are to be seen in what I have called the nebulous stratum in Coma Berenices. It appears, from the extended and branching figure of our nebula, that there is room for the decomposed small nebulae of a large reduced former great one to approach nearest to us in the sides than in any other parts. Nay, possibly there might originally be another very large joining branch, which in time became separated by the condensation of the stars; and this may be the reason of the little remaining breadth of our system in that very place; for the nebulae of the stratum of the Coma are brightest and most crowded just opposite to our situation, or in the pole of our system. As soon as this idea was suggested, I tried also the opposite pole; where accordingly I have met with a great number of nebulae, though under a much more scattered form.\n\n\"Some parts of our system indeed seem already to have sustained greater ravages of time than others; for instance in the body of the Scorpion is an opening or hole, which is probably owing to this cause. It is at least four degrees broad; but its height I have not yet ascertained. It is remarkable, that the 80 Nebuleuses sans Etoiles of the Connaissance des Temps, which is one of the richest and most compressed clutters of small stars I remember to have seen, is situated just on the west border of it, and would almost authorize a suspicion that the stars of which it is composed were collected from that place, and had left the vacancy. What adds not a little to this surmise is, that the same phenomenon is once more repeated with the fourth clutter of the Connaissance des Temps; which is also on the western border of another vacancy, and has moreover a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINIATURE\">miniature</a> clutter, or easily resolvable nebula, of about 2\u00bd minutes in diameter north, following it at no very great distance.\n\n\"There is a remarkable purity or clearness in the heavens when we look out of our stratum at the sides; that is, towards Leo, Virgo, and Coma Berenices on one hand, and towards Cetus on the other; whereas the ground of the heavens becomes troubled as we approach towards the length or height of it. These troubled appearances are easily to be explained by ascribing them to some of the distant straggling stars that yield hardly light enough to be distinguished.\"\nAnd I have indeed often experienced this to be the cause, by examining these troubled spots for a long while together, when at last I generally perceived the stars which occasioned them. But when we look towards the poles of our system, where the visual ray does not graze along the side, the straggling stars will of course be very few in number; and therefore the ground of the heavens will assume that purity which I have always observed to take place in those regions.\"\n\nThus, then, according to Dr Herschel, the universe consists of nebulae, or innumerable collections of innumerable stars, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> of which is a sun not only equal, but much superior to ours: at least if the words of Mr Nicholson have any weight; for he tells us, that \"each individual sun is destined to give light to hundreds of worlds that revolve about it, but which can no more be seen by us, on account of their great distance, than the solar planets can be seen from the fixed stars.\" \"Yet (continues he), as in this unexplored, and perhaps unexplorable, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABYSS\">abyss</a> of space, it is no necessary condition that the planets should be of the same magnitudes as those belonging to our system, it is not impossible but that planetary bodies may be discovered among the double and triple stars.\"\n\nThough in the above extracts from Dr Herschel's papers, the words condensation, clusters, &c., of stars frequently occur, we are by no means to imagine that any of the celestial bodies in our nebula are nearer to one another than we are to Sirius, whose distance is supposed not to be less than 400,000 times that of the sun from us, or 38 millions of millions of miles. The whole extent of the nebula being in some places near 500 times as great, must be such, that the light of a star placed at its extreme boundary, supposing it to fly with the velocity of 12 millions of miles every minute, must have taken near 3000 years to reach us. Dr Herschel, however, is by no means of opinion, that our nebula is the most considerable in the universe. \"As we are used (says he) to call the appearance of the heavens, where it is surrounded with a bright zone, the milky way, it may not be amiss to point out some other very remarkable nebulae, which cannot well be less, but are probably much larger, than our own system; and being also extended, the inhabitants of the planets that attend the stars which compose them, must likewise perceive the same phenomena; for which reason they may also be called milky ways, by way of distinction.\n\n\"My opinion of their size is grounded on the following observations: There are many round nebulae of the first form, of about five or six minutes in diameter, the stars of which I can see very distinctly; and on comparing them with the visual ray calculated from some of my long gauges, I suppose by the appearance of the small stars in those gauges, that the centres of these round nebulae may be 600 times the distance of Sirius from us.\"\u2014He then goes on to tell us, that the stars in such nebulae are probably twice as much condensed as those of our system; otherwise the centre of it would not be less than 6000 times the distance of Sirius from us; and that it is possibly much underrated by supposing it only 600 times the distance of that star.\n\n\"Some of these round nebulae (says Dr Herschel) have others near them, perfectly similar in form, colour, and the distribution of stars, but of only half the diameter; and the stars in them seem to be doubly crowded, and only at about half the distance from each other. They are indeed so small, as not to be visible without the utmost attention. I suppose these miniature nebulae to be at double the distance of the first. An instance equally remarkable and instructive is a case where, in the neighbourhood of two such nebulae as have been mentioned, I met with a third similar, resolvable, but much smaller and fainter nebula. The stars of it are no longer to be perceived; but a resemblance of colour with the former two, and its diminished size and light, may well permit us to place it at full twice the distance of the second, or about four or five times the distance of the first. And yet the nebulosity is not of the milky kind: nor is it so much as difficulty resolvable or colourless. Now in a few of the extended nebulae, the light changes gradually, so as from the resolvable to approach to the milky kind; which appears to me an indication, that the milky light of nebulae is owing to their much greater distance. A nebula, therefore, whose light is perfectly milky, cannot well be supposed to be at less than five or eight thousand times the distance of Sirius; and though the numbers here assumed are not to be taken otherwise than as very coarse estimates, yet an extended nebula, which an oblique situation, where it is possibly foreshortened by one-half, two-thirds, or three-fourths of its length, subtends a degree or more in diameter, cannot be otherwise than of a wonderful magnitude, and may well outvie our milky way in grandeur.\"\n\nDr Herschel next proceeds to give an account of several remarkable nebulae, and then concludes thus: \"Of time required to produce these effects (the formation of nebulae) may be easily conceived, when, in all probability, our whole system of about 800 stars in diameter, if it were seen at such a distance that one end of it might affume the resolvable nebulosity, would not, at the other end, present us with the irrefovable, much less with the colourless and milky, sort of nebulosities.\" Great indeed must be the length of time requisite for such distant bodies to form combinations by the laws of attraction, since, according to the distances he has assumed, the light of some of his nebulae must be thirty-five or forty-eight thousand years in arriving from them to us. It would be worth while then to inquire, whether attraction is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> propagated in time or not; or whether it moves quicker or slower than light?\n\nIn the course of Dr Herschel's observations and inquiries concerning the structure of the heavens, an observation occurred, that if the different systems were formed by the mutual attractions of the stars, the whole ther would be in danger of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> by the falling of them one upon another. A sufficient answer to this, he thinks, is, that if we can really prove the system of the universe to be what he has said, there is no doubt but that the great Author of it has amply provided for the preservation of the whole, though it should not appear to us in what manner this is effected. Several circumstances, however, he is of opinion, manifestly tend to a general preservation: as, in the first place, the indefinite extent of the sidereal heavens; which must produce a balance that will effectually secure all the parts of the great whole from approaching to each other.\nApparent Motions of the Heavenly Bodies.\n\nThere remains then (says he) only to see how the particular stars belonging to separate clusters are prevented from rushing on to their centres of attraction. This he supposes may be done by projectile forces; \"the admission of which will prove such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> against the seeming destructive power of attraction, as to secure from it all the stars belonging to a cluster, if not for ever, at least for millions of ages. Besides, we ought perhaps to look upon such clusters, and the destruction of a star now and then in some thousands of ages, as the very means by which the whole is preserved and renewed. These clusters may be the laboratories of the universe, wherein the most salutary remedies for the decay of the whole are prepared.\"\n\nIn speaking of the planetary nebulae, by which name he distinguishes those spots that are all over equally luminous, he says, \"If we should suppose them to be single stars with large diameters, we shall find it difficult to account for their not being brighter, unless we should admit that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> light of some stars may be very much inferior to that of the generality; which, however, can hardly be imagined to extend to such a degree. We might suppose them to be comets about their aphelion, if the brightness, as well as magnitude of their diameters, did not oppose this idea; so that, after all, we can hardly find any hypothesis so probable as that of their being nebulae; but then they must consist of stars that are compressed and accumulated in the highest degree. If it were not perhaps too hazardous to pursue a former surmise of a renewal in what I figuratively called the Laboratories of the Universe, the stars forming these extraordinary nebulae, by some decay or waste of nature being no longer fit for their former purposes, and having their projectile forces, if any such they had, retarded in each other's atmosphere, may rush at last together; and, either in succession or by one general tremendous shock, unite into a new body. Perhaps the extraordinary and sudden blaze of a new star in C\u00e6nopo\u00ebta's chair, in 1572, might possibly be of such a nature. If a little attention to these bodies should prove that, having no annual parallax, they belong most probably to the class of nebulae, they may then be expected to keep their station better than any one of the stars belonging to our system, on account of their being probably at a very great distance.\"\n\nAs the fixed stars constantly keep nearly the same situation relative to each other, astronomers have agreed to refer to them, as to so many fixed points, the different motions of the other heavenly bodies. Hence the reason of dividing them into constellations. But it was necessary besides, for the sake of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> precision to mark exactly the relative situation of every star in the celestial sphere. This is accomplished in the following manner.\n\n\"A great circle is supposed to pass through the two poles, and through the centre of every star. This circle is called a circle of declination. The arc of this circle included between the star and the equator measures the declination of the star. The declination of a star then is its perpendicular distance from the equator. It is north or south, according as the star is situated on the north or south side of the equator. All the stars situated in the same parallel of the equator have of course the same declination.\n\nThe declination then marks the situation of a star north or south from the equator. Precision requires fill another circle from which their distance east or west may be marked, in order to give the real place. The circle of declination which passes through that point of the equator, called the vernal equinoctial point, has been chosen for that purpose. The distance of the circle of declination of a given star from that point measured on the equator, or the arc of the equator included between the vernal equinox, and the circle of declination of the star is called its right ascension. If we know the declination and the right ascension of a star, we know its precise situation in the heavens.\n\nThe declination of any star may be easily found by observing the following rule: Take the meridian altitude of the star, at any place where the latitude is known; the complement of this is the zenith distance, and is called north or south, as the star is north or south at the time of observation. Then, 1. When the latitude of the place and zenith distance of the star are of different kinds, namely, one north and the other south, their difference will be the declination; and it is of the same kind with the latitude, when that is the greatest of the two, otherwise it is of the contrary kind. 2. If the latitude and the zenith distance are of the same kind, i.e., both north or both south, their sum is the declination; and it is of the same kind with the latitude.\n\nTo prove the truth of this rule, turn to fig. 86, where Z is the zenith of the place, EQ the equinoctial, and EZ the latitude. Let r represent the place of a star on the meridian, and Zr the zenith distance, the latitude being greater: then Er (the declination) will be equal to EZ - Zr (the zenith distance); again, let c be the place of a star in the meridian, when the zenith distance exceeds the latitude; then Er (the declination) = Zc (the zenith distance) - EZ (the latitude). And it is manifest, that in the former instance Z and r are on the same side of the equinoctial; and that in the latter case Z and c are on contrary sides. 2dly, Let y be the place of a star on the meridian, having its zenith distance Zy of the same kind with EZ the latitude of the place: then Ey (the declination) = EZ + Zy; and the declination is of the same kind as the latitude, because Z and y are on the same side of the equinoctial. Q. E. D.\n\nFor an Example, suppose that in north latitude 52\u00b0 15', the meridian altitude of a star is 51\u00b0 28' on the south; then 38\u00b0 32' the zenith distance, being taken from 52\u00b0 15' the latitude, leaves 13\u00b0 43' for the declination of the star north.\n\nHaving, by means like the above, found the declination of a star, it becomes requisite, in the next place, to know the right ascension, as its situation with regard to the equator will then be known. Now the right ascension being estimated from the point where the equator and ecliptic intersect each other in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, a point which is marked out by nothing that comes under the cognizance of our senses; some phenomenon, therefore, must be chosen, whose right ascension is either given, or may be readily known, at any time that the right ascensions of other objects may be discovered by comparison with it. For this purpose nothing appears\nApparent so proper as the sun; because its motion is the most Motions of simple, and its right ascension quickly found.\n\nFor if, in fig. 87, we have given QS the declination of the sun (which may be easily taken every day at noon by observation), and the angle SEQ the obliquity of the ecliptic\u2014i.e., one leg of a right-angled spherical triangle, and its opposite angle, to find the adjacent leg EO, the right ascension\u2014it may be done by this proportion; as the tangent of the obliquity of the ecliptic : the tangent of the declination :: radius : the fine of the right ascension reckoned from the nearer equinoctial point.\n\nFor example: suppose on the 13th of February the sun's south declination is found to $23^\\circ 24'$, and the obliquity of the ecliptic is $23^\\circ 28'$; we shall thus find the sun's right ascension:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{As tangt. } & 23^\\circ 28' = 9.6376106 \\\\\n\\text{To tangt. } & 13^\\circ 24' = 9.3770030 \\\\\n\\text{So is radius} & 10.0000000\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTo fine $33^\\circ 16' 58''$ $= 9.7393924$\n\nHere $33^\\circ 16' 58''$ is the sun's distance from $\\gamma$; but as the declination is at that time decreasing, and the sun approaching $\\gamma$, this must be taken from $360^\\circ$, and the remainder $326^\\circ 43' 2''$ is the right ascension.\n\nIn a similar manner may the sun's right ascension be calculated for every day at noon, and arranged in tables for use: for any intermediate time between one day at noon and the following, the right ascension may be determined by proportion.\n\nThe longitude ES of the sun, when required, may be readily found by the rules to ascertain the hypothe-\n\nnuse of the same triangle.\n\nThe apparent diurnal motion of the heavenly bodies being uniform, and performed in circles parallel to the equator, the interval of the times in which two stars pass over any meridian must bear the same proportion to the period of the diurnal motion, as that of the equator intercepted between the two secondaries passing through the stars, does to $360^\\circ$, as is evident from the nature of the sphere: we may therefore find the right ascension of a star thus: Let an accurate pendulum clock be so regulated that the index may pass over the twenty-four hours during the time in which any fixed star after departing from the meridian will return to it again, which is rather less than twenty-four hours. Then let the index of a clock thus regulated be set to twelve o'clock when the sun is on the meridian; and observe the time the index points to, when the fixed star whose right ascension is sought comes to the meridian; which may be most accurately known by means of a transit telescope. Let these hours and parts, as marked by the clock, be converted into degrees, &c. of the equator, by allowing $15^\\circ$ to an hour; and the difference between the right ascensions of the fixed star and the sun will be known: this difference added to the sun's right ascension for that day at noon, gives the right ascension of the fixed star sought.\n\nOr, if a clock whose dial plate is divided into $360^\\circ$, instead of twelve hours, be ordered in such a manner, that the index may pass round the whole circle in the interval which a star requires to come to the same meridian again, and another index be so managed as to point out the sexagesimal parts: then, when the sun is on the meridian, let the indices of the clock be put to his right ascension at noon that day; and when the star Apparent comes to the meridian, its right ascension will be shown by the clock, without any kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a>.\n\nThe stars are referred likewise to the ecliptic as well as to the equator. In that case the terms longitude and latitude are used.\n\nThe longitude of any of the heavenly bodies is an Longitude arc of the ecliptic contained between the first point of Aries, and a secondary to the ecliptic or circle of latitude, passing through the body; it is always measured according to the order of the signs. If the body be supposed seen from the centre of the earth, it is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GEOCENTRIC\">geocentric</a> longitude; but if it be supposed seen from the centre of the sun, then is the longitude heliocentric.\n\nThe latitude of a heavenly body is its distance from the ecliptic, measured upon a secondary to the ecliptic drawn through the body. If the latitude be such as is seen from the earth's centre, it is called geocentric latitude; but if it be supposed seen from the centre of the sun, it is heliocentric.\n\nThe equator being the principal circle which respects the earth, the latitudes and longitudes of terrestrial objects are referred to it; and, for a similar reason (the sun's motion in the ecliptic rendering that the principal of the celestial circles), the situations of heavenly objects are generally ascertained by their latitudes and longitudes referred to the ecliptic: it has therefore become a useful problem to find the latitudes and longitudes of the stars, &c., having their declinations, and right ascensions, with the obliquity of the ecliptic, given. One of the best methods of performing this problem has been thus investigated: Let S be the place of the body (fig. 88.), EC the ecliptic, EQ the equator; and SL and SR being respectively perpendicular to EC and EQ, ER will represent the right ascension, SR the declination, EL the longitude, and SL the latitude; then, by spherics, rad.: fine ER :: co-tang. SR :: co-tang. SER; and SER + CEO = SEL. Also, co-fine SER : rad. :: tang. ER : tang. ES; and rad. :: co-fine SEL :: tang. ES : tang. EL; therefore, co-fine SER : co-fine SEL :: tang. ER : tang. EL; whence we readily get,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{co-fine SEL}}{\\text{co-fine SER}} \\times \\text{tang. ER} = \\text{the tangent of EL, the longitude.}\n\\]\n\nThen, rad.: fine of EL :: tang. SEL : tang. SL, the latitude.\n\nTheory of the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> LP and NP, taken together, are less than a semicircle, each of them being less than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a>, as appears, because GN, the distance of the moon in G from its node N, is here supposed to be a quarter part of a circle. After the moon is passed beyond G, the arches are altered; for then these arches will be greater than quarters of a circle; by which means the inclination will be again increased, though the nodes still go on to move the same way. Suppose the moon in H (fig. 143.), and that the plane which touches the line AKGI in H intersects the plane of the earth's motion in the line QTR, and the plane NGO in the line TV, and besides, that the circle QJR be described in that plane: then, for the same reason as before, the point V will fall between H and G, and the plane RVQ will pass beyond the last plane OVN, causing the points Q and K to fall farther from A and C than N and O. But the arches NV, VQ are each greater than the quarter of a circle; consequently the angle under BOV will be greater than that under BNV. Lastly, when the moon is by this attraction of the sun drawn at length into the plane of the earth's orbit, the node will have receded yet more, and the inclination be so much increased, as to become somewhat more than at first: for the line AKGHI being convex to all the planes which touch it, the part HI will wholly fall between the plane QVR and the plane ABC; so that the point I will fall between B and R; and, drawing ITW, the point W will be farther removed from A than Q. But it is evident, that the plane which passes through the earth T and touches the line AGI in the point I, will cut the plane of the earth's motion ABCD in the time ITW, and be inclined to the same in the angle under HIB; so that the node which was first in A, after having passed into L, N, and Q, comes at last in the point W, as the node which was at first in C has passed from thence successively through the points M, O, and R, to I. But the angle HIB, which is now the inclination of the orbit to the plane of the ecliptic, is manifestly not less than the angle under ECB or EAB, but rather something greater. Thus the moon, while it passes from the plane of the earth's motion in the quarter, till it comes again into the same plane, has the nodes of its orbit continually moved backward, and the inclination of it at first diminished till it comes to G in fig. 128., which is near to its conjunction with the sun, but afterwards is increased again almost by the same degrees, till upon the moon's arrival again to the plane of the earth's motion, the inclination of the orbit is restored to something more than its first magnitude, though the difference is not very great, because the points I and C are not far distant from each other.\n\nIn like manner, if the moon had departed from the quarter at C, it should have described the curve line CXW in fig. 140. between the planes AFC and ADC, which would be convex to the former planes and concave to the latter; so that here also the nodes would continually recede, and the inclination of the orbit gradually diminish more and more, till the moon arrived near its opposition to the sun in X; but from that time the inclination should again increase till it become a little greater than at first. This will easily appear by considering, that as the action of the sun upon the moon, by exceeding its action upon the earth, drew it out of the plane AEC towards the sun, while the moon passed from A to I; so during its passage from C to W, the moon being all that time farther from the sun than the earth, it will be attracted less; and the earth, together with the plane AECF, will as it were be drawn from the moon, in such a manner, that the path the moon describes shall appear from the earth as it did in the former case by the moon being drawn away.\n\nSuch are the changes which the nodes and inclination of the moon's orbit undergo when the nodes are the nodes in the quarters; but when the nodes by their motion, explained, and the motion of the sun together, come to be situated between the quarter and conjunction or opposition, their motion and the change made in the inclination of the orbit are somewhat different.\u2014Let AGH, in fig. 145., be a circle described in the plane of the earth's motion, having the earth in T for its centre, A the point opposite to the sun, and G a fourth part of the circle distant from A. Let the nodes of the moon's orbit be situated in the line BTD, and B the node falling between A, the place where the moon would be in the full, and G the place where she would be in the quarter. Suppose BEDF to be the plane in which the moon attempts to move when it proceeds from the point B: then, because the moon in B is more distant from the sun than the earth, it will be less attracted by the sun, and will not descend towards the sun so fast as the earth, consequently it will quit the plane BEDF, which is supposed to accompany the earth, and describe the line BIK convex to it, till such time as it comes to the point K, where it will be in the quarter; but from thenceforth being more attracted than the earth, the moon will change its course, and the following part of the path it describes will be concave towards the plane BED or BGD, and continue concave to the plane BGD till it crosses that plane in J, just as in the preceding case. Now, to show that the nodes, while the moon is passing from B to K, will proceed forward, or move the same way with the moon, and at the same time the inclination of the orbit will increase when the moon is in the point I, let the line MIN pass through the earth T, and touch the path of the moon in I, cutting the plane of the earth's motion in the line MTN, and the line BED in TO. Because the line BIK is convex to the plane BED, which touches it in B, the plane NIM must cross the plane DEB before it meets the plane CGB; and therefore the point M will fall from G towards B; and the node of the moon's orbit being translated from B towards M is moved forward.\n\nAgain, the angle under OMG, which the plane MON makes with the plane BGC, is greater than the angle OBG, which the plane BOD makes with the same. This appears from what has been already demonstrated, because the arches RO and OM are each of them less than the quarter of a circle; and therefore, taken both together, are less than a semicircle. But further, when the moon is come to the point K in its quarter, the nodes will be advanced yet farther forward, and the inclination of the orbit also more augmented. Hitherto we have referred the moon's motion to that plane which, passing through the earth, touches the path of the moon in the point where the moon is, as we have already said that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of astronomers\nTheory of astronomers is. But in the point K no such plane can be found; on the contrary, seeing the line of the moon's motion on one side the point K is convex to the plane BED, and on the other side concave to the same, so that no plane can pass through the points T and K, but will cut the line BKL in that point; therefore, instead of such a touching plane, we must make use of PKQ, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a>, and with which the line BKL shall make a less angle than with any other plane; for this does as it were touch the line BK in the point K, since it cuts it in such a manner that no other plane can be drawn so as to pass between the line BK and the plane PKQ. But now it is evident, that the point P, or the node, is removed from M towards G, that is, has moved yet farther forward; and it is likewise as manifest, that the angle under KPG, or the inclination of the moon's orbit in the point K, is greater than the angle under IMG, for the reason already given.\n\nAfter the moon has passed the quarter, her plane being concave to the plane AGCH, the nodes will recede as before till she arrives at the point L; which shows, that, considering the whole time of the moon's passing from B to L, at the end of that time the nodes shall be found to have receded, or to be placed more backward, when the moon is in L than when it was in B; for the moon takes a longer time in passing from K to L than in passing from B to K; and therefore the nodes continue to recede a longer time than they moved forwards; so that their receds must surmount their advance. In the same manner, while the moon is in its passage from K to L, the inclination of the orbit shall diminish till the moon come to the point in which it is one quarter part of a circle distant from its node, suppose in the point R; and from that time the inclination will again increase. Since, therefore, the inclination of the orbit increases while the moon is passing from B to K, and diminishes itself again only while the moon is passing from K to R, then augments again while the moon passes from B to L; it thence comes to be much more increased than diminished, and thus will be difformly greater when the moon comes to L than when it gets out from B. In like manner, when the moon is passing from L on the other side the plane AGCH, the node will advance forward as long as the moon is between the point L and the next quarter; but afterwards it will recede till the moon come to pass the plane AGCH again, in the point V between B and A; and because the time between the moon's passing from L to the next quarter is less than the time between that quarter and the moon's coming to the point V, the node will have receded more than it has advanced; so that the point V will be nearer to A than L is to C. So also the inclination of the orbit, when the moon is in V, will be greater than when she was in L; for this inclination increases all the time the moon is between L and the next quarter, decreasing only when she is passing from this quarter to the mid-way between the two nodes, and from thence increases again during the whole passage through the other half of the way to the next node.\n\nIn this manner we see, that at every period of the moon the nodes will have receded, and thereby have approached towards a conjunction with the sun: but this will be much forwarded by the motion of the Theory of earth, or the apparent motion of the sun himself. In the last scheme the sun will appear to have moved from S towards W. Let us suppose it had appeared to have moved from S to W while the moon's node has receded from B to V; then drawing the line WTX, the arch VX will represent the distance of the line drawn between the nodes from the sun when the moon is in V; whereas the arch BA represented that distance when the moon was in B. This visible motion of the sun is much greater than that of the node; for the sun appears to revolve quite round in one year, while the node is near nineteen in making its revolution. We have also seen that when the moon was in the quadrature, the inclination of her orbit decreased till she came to the conjunction or opposition, according to the node it set out from; but that afterwards it again increased till it became at the next node rather greater than at the former. When the node is once removed from the quarter nearer to a conjunction with the sun, the inclination of the moon's orbit, when she comes into the node, is more sensibly greater than it was in the node preceding; the inclination of the orbit by this means more and more increasing till the nodes come into conjunction with the sun: at which time it has been shown that the latter has no power to change the plane of her orbit. As soon, however, as the nodes are got out of conjunction towards the other quarters, they begin to recede as before; but the inclination of the orbit in the appulse of the moon to each succeeding node is less than at the preceding, till the nodes come again into the quarters. This will appear as follows: Let A, in fig. 146, represent one of the moon's nodes placed between the point of opposition B and the quarter C. Let the plane ADE pass through the earth T, and touch the path of the moon in A. Let the line AFGH be the path of the moon in her passage from A to H, where she crosses again the plane of the earth's motion. This line will be convex towards the plane ADE, till the moon comes to G, where she is in the quarter; and after this, between G and H, the same line will be concave towards this plane. All the time this line is convex towards the plane ADE, the nodes will recede; and, on the contrary, move forward when the line is concave towards that plane. But the moon is longer in passing from A to G, and therefore the nodes go backwards farther than they proceed; and therefore, on the whole, when the moon has arrived at H, the nodes will have receded, that is, the point H will fall between B and E. The inclination of the orbit will decrease till the moon is arrived at the point F in the middle between A and H. Through the passage between F and G the inclination will increase, but decrease again in the remaining part of the passage from G to H, and consequently at H must be less than at A. Similar effects, both with respect to the nodes and inclination of the orbit, will take place in the following passage of the moon on the other side of the plane ABEC from H, till it comes over that plane again in I.\n\nThus the inclination of the orbit is greatest when the line drawn between the moon's nodes will pass through the sun, and least when this line lies in the quarters; especially if the moon at the same time be in conjunction with the sun, or in the opposition. In\nTheory of the first of these cases the nodes have no motion; in all others, the nodes will each month have receded: and this retrograde motion will be greatest when the nodes are in the quarters, for in that case they will have no progressive motion during the whole month; but in all other cases they at some times go forward, viz. whenever the moon is between either of the quarters and the node which is least distant from that quarter than the fourth part of a circle.\n\nWe have now only to explain those irregularities of the lunar motion which arise from her motion in an ellipse. From what has been already said it appears, that the earth acts on the moon in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> duplicate proportion of the distance; therefore the moon, if undisturbed by the sun, would move round the earth in a true ellipse, and a line drawn from the earth to the sun would pass over equal spaces in equal times. We have, however, already shown, that this equality is disturbed by the sun, and likewise how the figure of the orbit is changed each month; that the moon is nearer the earth at the new and full, and more remote in the quarters than it would be without the sun. We must, however, pass by those monthly changes, and consider the effect which the sun will have in the different situations of the axis of the orbit in respect of that luminary. This action varies the force wherewith the moon is drawn towards the earth. In the quarters the force of the earth is directly increased by the sun, but diminished at the new and full; and in the intermediate places the influence of the earth is sometimes lessened, sometimes affected, by the action of that luminary. In these intermediate places, however, between the quarters and the conjunction or opposition, the sun's action is so oblique to that of the earth on the moon, as to produce that alternate acceleration and retardation of her motion so often mentioned. But besides this effect, the power by which the moon attracts the earth towards itself, will not be at full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> with the same force as if the sun acted not at all, on the moon; and this effect of the sun's action, whereby it corroborates or weakens the action of the earth, is here only to be considered; and by means of this influence it comes to pass, that the power by which the moon is impelled towards the earth is not perfectly in the reciprocal duplicate proportion of the distance, and of consequence the moon will not describe a perfect ellipse. One particular in which the lunar orbit will differ from a perfect elliptic figure, consists in the places where the motion of the moon is perpendicular to the line drawn from itself to the earth. In an ellipse, after the moon should have set out in the direction perpendicular to this line, drawn from itself to the earth, and at its greatest distance from the earth, its motion would again become perpendicular to this line drawn between itself and the earth, and the moon be at its nearest distance from the earth, when it should have performed half its period: after having performed the other half period of its motion, it would again become perpendicular to the forementioned line, and the moon return to the place whence it set out, and have recovered again its greatest distance. But the moon in its real motion, after setting out as before, sometimes makes more than half a revolution before its motion comes again to be perpendicular to the line drawn from itself to the earth, and the moon is at its nearest distance, and then performs more than another half of an entire revolution before its motion can a second time recover its perpendicular direction to the line drawn from the moon to the earth, and the former arrive again at its greatest distance from the earth. At other times the moon will descend to her nearest distance before she has made half a revolution, and recover again its greatest distance before it has made an entire revolution. The place where the moon is at its greatest distance is called the moon's apogee, and the place of her nearest distance her perigee; and this change of place, or of the moon's motion successively to its greatest distance from the earth, is called the motion of the apogee. The manner in which this motion of the apogee is caused by the sun, comes now to be explained.\n\nSir Isaac Newton has shown, that if the moon were attracted toward the earth by a composition of two powers, one of which was reciprocally in the duplicate proportion of the distance from the earth, and the other reciprocally in the triplicate proportion of the same distance; then, though the line described by the moon would not be in reality an ellipse, yet the moon's motion might be perfectly explained by an ellipse whose axis should be made to move round the earth: this motion being in consequence, as astronomers express themselves, that is, the same way as the moon itself moves, if the moon be attracted by the sum of the two powers; but the axis must move in antecedence, or contrary way, if the moon be acted upon by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTECEDENT\">antecedent</a> difference of these forces. We have already explained once and what is meant by duplicate proportion, namely, that concurrence exists if three magnitudes, as A, B, and C, are so related that the second B bears the same proportion to the third C as the first A bears to the second B; then the proportion of the first A to the third C is the triplicate proportion of the first A to the second B. Now if a fourth magnitude D be assumed, to which C shall bear the same proportion as A bears to B, and B to C; then the proportion of A to D is the triplicate of the proportion of A to B.\n\nLet now T (fig. 147, 148.) denote the earth, and suppose the moon in the point A its apogee or the moon's greatest distance from the earth, moving in the direction AF perpendicular to AB, and acted upon by determining the earth by two such forces as already mentioned. By that power alone, which is reciprocally in the duplicate proportion of the distance, if the moon set out with a proper degree of velocity, the ellipse AMB may be described; but if the moon be acted upon by the sum of the forementioned powers, and her velocity in the point A be augmented in a certain proportion; or if that velocity be diminished in a certain proportion,* and the moon be acted upon by the difference of those powers; in both these cases the line AE, which shall pass through the moon, shall thus be determined, prop. 44. Let the point M be that into which the moon would have arrived in any given point of time, had it moved in the ellipse AMB; draw MT and likewise CT in such a manner that the angle ATM shall bear the same proportion to the angle under ATC as the velocity with which the ellipse must have been described bears to the difference between this velocity and that with which the moon must set out from the point A, in order to describe the path AE. Let the angle ATC be taken towards the moon, as in fig. 133.\nTheory of Universal Gravitation.\n\nIf the moon be attracted by the sum of the powers; but the contrary way (as in fig. 134.) if by their difference. Then let the line AB be moved into the position CD, and the ellipsis AMB into the situation CND, so that the point M be translated to L; then the point L shall fall upon the path of the moon AE. Now the angular motion of the line AT, whereby it is removed into the situation CT, represents the motion of the apogeeon; by the means of which the motion of the moon might be fully explained by the ellipsis AMB, if the action of the sun upon it was directed to the centre of the earth, and reciprocally in the triplicate proportion of the moon's distance from it; but that not being so, the motion of the apogeeon will not proceed in the regular manner now described. It is, however, to be observed here, that in the first of the two preceding cases, where the apogeeon moves forward, the whole centripetal power increases faster, with the decrease of distance, than if the entire power were reciprocally in the duplicate proportion of the distance; because one part only is already in that proportion, and the other part, which is added to this to make up the whole power, increases faster with the decrease of distance. On the other hand, when the centripetal power is the difference between these two bodies, it increases less with the decrease of the distance, than if it were simply in the reciprocal duplicate proportion of the distance. Therefore, if we choose to explain the moon's motion by an ellipsis, which may be done without any sensible error, we may collect in general, that when the power by which the moon is attracted to the earth, by varying the distance, increases in a greater than the duplicate proportion of the distance diminished, a motion in consequence must be ascribed to the apogeeon; but that when the attraction increases in a smaller proportion than that just mentioned, the apogeeon must have given to it a motion in antecedence. It is then observed by Sir Isaac Newton, that the former of these cases obtains when the moon is in the conjunction and opposition, and the latter when she is in the quarters; so that in the former the apogeeon moves according to the order of the signs; in the other, the contrary way. But, as has been already mentioned, the disturbance given to the action of the earth by the sun in the conjunction and opposition, being near twice as great as in the quarters, the apogeeon will advance with a greater velocity than recede, and in the compass of a whole revolution of the moon will be carried in consequence.\n\nSir Isaac shows, in the next place, that when the line AB coincides with the line that joins the sun and earth, the progressive motion of the apogeeon, when the moon is in conjunction or opposition, exceeds the retrograde, in the quadratures, more than in any other situation of the line AB. On the contrary, when the line AB makes right angles with that which joins the earth and sun, the retrograde motion will be more considerable, nay, is found to great as to exceed the progressive; so that in this case the apogeeon, in the compass of an entire revolution of the moon, is carried in antecedence. Yet from the considerations already mentioned, the progressive motion exceeds the other; so that, on the whole, the motion of the apogeeon is in consequence. The line AB also changes its situation with that which joins the earth and sun by such slow degrees, that the inequalities of the motion of the apogeeon, arising from this last consideration, are much greater than what arise from the other.\n\nThis unsteady motion of the apogeeon gives rise to another inequality in the motion of the moon herself; so that it cannot at all times be explained by the same Occulting ellipsis. For whenever the apogeeon moves in consequence, the motion of the luminary must be referred to an orbit more eccentric than what the moon would tricity describe, if the whole power by which the moon was the moon's acted upon in its passing from the apogeeon changed orbit, according to the reciprocal duplicate proportion of its distance from the earth, and by that means the moon did describe an immovable ellipsis; and when the apogeeon moves in antecedence, the moon's motion must be referred to an orbit less eccentric. In the former of the two figures last referred to, the true place of the moon L falls without the orbit AMB, to which its motion is referred: whence the orbit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALE\">ALE</a> truly described by the moon, is less incurvated in the point A than is the orbit AMB; therefore this orbit is more oblong, and differs farther from a circle than the ellipsis would, whose curvature in A were equal to that of the line <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALB\">ALB</a>: that is, the proportion of the distance of the earth T from the centre of the ellipsis to its axis, will be greater in AMB than in the other; but that other is the ellipsis which the moon would describe, if the power acting upon it in the point A were altered in the reciprocal duplicate proportion of the distance; and consequently the moon being drawn more forcibly toward the earth, it will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> nearer to it. On the other hand, when the apogeeon recedes, the power acting on the moon increases with the decrease of distance, in less than the duplicate proportion of the distance; and therefore the moon is less impelled towards the earth, and will not defend so low. Now, suppose, in the former of these figures, that the apogeeon A is in the situation where it is approaching towards the conjunction or opposition of the sun; in this case its progressive motion will be more and more accelerated. Here suppose the moon, after having descended from A through the orbit AE as far as F, where it is come to its nearest distance from the earth, ascends again up the line FG. As the motion of the apogeeon is here more and more accelerated, it is plain that the cause of its motion must also be on the increase; that is, the power by which the moon is drawn to the earth, will decrease with the increase of the moon's distance in her ascent from F, in a greater proportion than that wherewith it is increased with the decrease of distance in the moon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> to it. Consequently the moon will ascend to a greater distance than AT from whence it is descended; therefore the proportion of the greatest distance of the moon to the least is increased. But farther, when the moon again defends, the power will increase yet farther with the decrease of distance than in the last ascent it increased with the augmentation of distance. The moon therefore must descend nearer to the earth than it did before, and the proportion of the greatest distance to the least be yet more increased. Thus, as long as the apogeeon is advancing to the conjunction or opposition, the proportion of the greatest distance of the moon from the earth to the least will continually increase; and the elliptical orbit to which the moon's motion is referred will...\nTheory of will become more and more eccentric. As soon, however, as the apogee is past the conjunction or opposition with the sun, its progressive motion abates, and with it the proportion of the greatest distance of the moon from the earth to the least will also diminish; and when the apogee becomes retrograde, the diminution of this proportion will be still farther continued, until the apogee comes into the quarter; from thence this proportion, and the eccentricity of the orbit, will increase again. Thus the orbit of the moon is most eccentric when the apogee is in conjunction with the sun, or in opposition to it, and least of all when the apogee is in the quarters. These changes in the nodes, the inclination of the orbit to the plane of the earth's motion, in the apogee and in the eccentricity, are varied like the other inequalities in the motion of the moon, by the different distance of the earth from the sun being greatest when their cause is greatest; that is, when the earth is nearest the sun. Sir Isaac Newton has computed the very quantity of many of the moon's inequalities. That acceleration of the moon's motion which is called the variation, when greatest, removes the luminous out of the place in which it would otherwise be found somewhat more than half a degree. If the moon, without disturbance from the sun, would describe a circle concentrical to the earth, his action will cause her approach nearer in the conjunction and opposition than in the quarters, nearly in the proportion of 69 to 70. It has already been mentioned, that the nodes perform their period in almost 19 years. This has been found by observation; and the computations of Sir Isaac affixed to them the same period. The inclination of the moon's orbit, when least, is an angle about one-eighteenth of that which constitutes a right angle; and the difference between the greatest and least inclination, is about one-eighteenth of the least inclination, according to our author's computation; which is also agreeable to the general observations of astronomers.\n\nThere is one empirical equation of the moon's motion which the comparison of ancient and modern eclipses obliges the astronomers to employ, without being able to deduce it, like the rest, a priori, from the theory of an universal force inversely proportional to the square of the distance. It has therefore been considered as a stumbling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol3.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NEWTONIAN_PHILOSOPHY\">Newtonian <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>. This is what is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> equation of the moon's mean motion. The mean motion is deduced from a comparison of distant observations. The time between them, being divided by the number of intervening revolutions, gives the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> time of one revolution, or the mean lunar period. When the ancient Chaldean observations are compared with those of Hipparchus, we obtain a certain period; when those of Hipparchus are compared with some in the 9th century, we obtain a period somewhat shorter; when the last are compared with those of Tycho Brahe, we obtain one still shorter; and when Brahe's are compared with those of our day, we obtain the shortest period of all\u2014and thus the moon's mean motion appears to accelerate continually; and the accelerations appear to be in the duplicate ratio of the times. The acceleration for the century which ended in 1700 is about 9 seconds of a degree; that is to say, the whole motion of the moon during the 17th century must be increased 9 seconds, in order to obtain its Theory of motion during the 18th; and as much must be taken from it, or added to the computed longitude, to obtain its motion during the 16th; and the double of this must be taken from the motion during the 16th, to obtain its motion during the 15th, &c. Or it will be sufficient to calculate the moon's mean longitude for any time past or to come by the secular motion which obtains in the present century, and then to add to this longitude the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> of 9 seconds, multiplied by the square of the number of centuries which intervene. Thus having found the mean longitude for the year 1200, add 9 seconds, multiplied by 36, for six centuries. By this method we shall make our calculation agree with the most ancient and all intermediate observations. If we neglect this correction, we shall differ more than a degree from the Chaldean observation of the moon's place in the heavens.\n\nThe mathematicians having succeeded so completely in deducing all the observed inequalities of the planetary motions, from the single principle, that the deflecting forces diminished in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSE\">inverse</a> duplicate ratio of the distances, were fretted by this exception, the reality of which they could not contest. Many opinions were formed about its cause. Some have attempted to deduce it from the action of the planets on the moon; others have deduced it from the oblate form of the earth, and the translation of the ocean by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a>; others have supposed it owing to the refraction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a> in the celestial spaces; and others have imagined that the action of the deflecting force requires time for its propagation to a distance; but their deductions have been proved unsatisfactory, and have by no means the precision and evidence that have been attained in the other questions of physical astronomy. At last M. de la Place, of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, has happily succeeded, and deduced the secular equation of the moon from the Newtonian law of planetary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFLECTION\">deflection</a>. It is produced in the following manner.\n\nSuppose the moon revolving round the earth, undisturbed by any deflection toward the sun, and that the time of her revolution is exactly ascertained. Now let Newtonian influence of the sun be added. This diminishes her natural tendency to the earth in opposition and conjunction, and increases it in the quadratures: but the diminutions exceed the augmentations both in quantity and duration; and the excess is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{19}$th of her tendency to the earth. Therefore this diminished tendency cannot retain the moon in the same orbit; she must retire farther from the earth, and describe an orbit which is less incurvated by $\\frac{1}{19}$th part; and she must employ a longer time in a revolution. The period therefore which we observe, is not that which would have obtained had the moon been influenced by the earth alone. We should not have known that her natural period was increased, had the disturbing influence of the sun remained unchanged; but this varies in the inverse triplicate ratio of the earth's distance from the sun, and is therefore greater in our winter, when the earth is nearer to the sun. This is the source of the annual equation, by which the lunar period in January is made to exceed that in July nearly 24 minutes. The angular velocity of the moon is diminished in general $\\frac{1}{19}$, and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMERICAL\">numerical</a> coefficient varies in the inverse ratio of the cube.\nTheory of Universal Gravitation.\n\nIf we expand this inverse cube of the earth's distance into a series arranged according to the fines and cofines of the earth's mean motion, making the earth's mean distance unity, we shall find that the series contains a term equal to \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of the square of the eccentricity of the earth's orbit. Therefore the expression of the diminution of the moon's angular velocity contains a term equal to \\( \\frac{1}{79} \\) of this velocity, multiplied by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the square of the earth's eccentricity; or equal to the product of the square of the eccentricity, multiplied by the moon's angular velocity, and divided by 119.33 (3 of 179). Did this eccentricity remain constant, this product would also be constant, and would still be confounded with the general diminution, making a constant part of it; but the eccentricity of the earth's orbit is known to diminish, and its diminution is the result of the universality of the Newtonian law of the planetary deflections. Although this diminution is exceedingly small, its effect on the lunar motion becomes sensible by accumulation in the course of ages. The eccentricity diminishing, the diminution of the moon's angular motion must also diminish, that is, the angular motion must increase.\n\nDuring the 18th century, the square of the earth's eccentricity has diminished 0.0000015325, the mean distance from the sun being \\( = r \\). This has increased the angular motion of the moon in that time 0.0000001285. As this augmentation is gradual, we must multiply the angular motion during the century by the half of this quantity, in order to obtain its accumulated effect. This will be found to be 9\" very nearly, which exceeds that deduced from a most careful comparison of the motion of the last two centuries, only by a fraction of a second.\n\nAs long as the diminution of the square of the eccentricity of the earth's orbit can be supposed proportional to the time, this effect will be as the squares of the times. When this theory is compared with observations, the coincidence is wonderful indeed. The effect on the moon's motion is periodical, as the change of the solar eccentricity is, and its period includes millions of years. Its effect on the moon's longitude will amount to several degrees before the secular acceleration change to a retardation.\n\nThose who are not familiar with the disquisitions of modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>, may conceive this question in the following manner.\n\nLet the length of a lunar period be computed for the earth's distance from the sun for every day of the year. Add them into one sum, and divide this by their number, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUOTIENT\">quotient</a> will be the mean lunar period. This will be found to be greater than the arithmetical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> between the greatest and the least. Then suppose the eccentricity of the earth's orbit to be greater, and make the same computation. The average period will be found still greater, while the medium between the greatest and least periods will hardly differ from the former. Something very like this may be observed without any calculation, in a case very similar. The angular velocity of the sun is inversely as the square of his distance. Look into the solar tables, and the greatest diurnal motion will be found 3673\", and the least 3433\". The mean of these is 3553\", but the medium of the whole is 3548\". Now make a similar observation in tables of the motion of the planet Mars, whose eccentricity is much greater. We shall find that the medium between the greatest and least exceeds the true medium of all in a much greater proportion.\n\nIt has been supposed by some philosophers that the moon was originally a comet, which passing very near the earth, had been made to revolve round her by the force of attraction. But if we calculate ever so far backwards, we still find the moon revolving round the earth as the planets round the sun, which could not be the case if this opinion were true. Hence it follows, that neither the moon nor any of the satellites have ever been comets.\n\nSect. V. Of Irregularities in the Satellites of Jupiter.\n\nThe subterranean of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> had occasioned their motions to be very carefully observed, ever since these uses of them were first suggested by Galileo; and their theory is as far advanced as that of the primary planets. It has peculiar difficulties. Being very near to Jupiter, the great deviation of his figure from perfect sphericity makes the relation between their distances from his centre and their gravitations toward it vastly complicated. But this only excited the mathematicians to much the more to improve their analysis; and they saw, in this little system of Jupiter and his attendants, an epitome of the solar system, where the great rapidity of the motions must bring about in a short time every variety of configuration or relative position, and thus give us an example of those mutual disturbances of the primary planets, which require thousands of years for the discovery of their periods and limits. We have derived some very remarkable and useful pieces of information from this investigation; and have been led to the discovery of the eternal durability of the solar system, a thing which Newton greatly doubted of.\n\nMr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">Pound</a> had observed long ago, that the irregularities of the three interior satellites were repeated in a period of 437 days; and this observation is found to be just to this day.\n\n| Days | H. M. |\n|------|-------|\n| 247 revolutions of the first occupy | 437 3 44 |\n| 123 second | 437 3 42 |\n| 61 third | 437 3 36 |\n| 26 fourth | 435 14 16 |\n\nThis naturally led mathematicians to examine their motions, and see in what manner their relative positions or configurations, as they are called, corresponded to this period; and it is found, that the mean longitude of the first satellite, minus thrice the mean longitude of the second, plus twice the mean longitude of the third, always made 180 degrees. This requires that the mean motion of the first, added to twice that of the third, shall be equal to thrice the mean motion of the second. This correspondence of the mean motions is of itself a singular thing, and the odds against its probability seems infinitely great; and when we add to this the particular positions of the satellites in any one moment, which is necessary for the above constant relation of their longitudes, the improbability of the coincidence, as a thing quite fortuitous, becomes infinitely greater. Doubts were first entertained of the coincidence,\ncoincidence, because it was not indeed accurate to a second. The result of the investigation is curious. When we follow out the consequences of mutual gravitation, we find, that although neither the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> motions of projection, nor the points of the orbit from which the satellites were projected, were precisely such as suited these observed relations of their revolutions and their contemporaneous longitudes; yet if they differed from them only by very minute quantities, the mutual gravitations of the satellites would in time bring them into those positions, and those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of mean motion, that would induce the observed relations; and when they are once induced they will be continued forever. There will indeed be a small equation, depending on the degree of insufficiency of the first motions and positions; and this causes the whole system to oscillate, as it were, a little, and but a very little way on each side of this exact and permanent state. The permanency of these relations will not be destroyed by any secular equations arising from external causes; such as the action of the fourth satellite, or of the sun, or of a resisting medium; because their mutual actions will distribute this equation as it did the original error.\n\nFor a full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> of this curious but difficult subject, we refer the reader to the dissertations of La <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRANGE\">Grange</a> and La Place, and to the tables lately published by Delambre. These mathematicians have shown, that if the mass of Jupiter be represented by unity, that of his satellites will be represented by the following numbers:\n\n| Satellite | Mass |\n|-----------|------|\n| First     | 0.0000172011 |\n| Second    | 0.0000237103 |\n| Third     | 0.0000872128 |\n| Fourth    | 0.0000544681 |\n\nSect. VI. Of Saturn's Ring.\n\nThe most important addition (in a philosophical view) which has been made to astronomical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> since the discovery of the aberration of light and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUTATION\">nutation</a> of the earth's axis, is that of the rotation of Saturn's ring. The ring itself is an object quite peculiar; and when it was discovered that all the bodies which had any immediate connexion with a planet gravitated toward that planet, it became an interesting question to ascertain what was the nature of this ring? What supports this immense arch of heavy matter without its resting on the planet? What maintains it in perpetual concentricity with the body of Saturn, and keeps its surface in one invariable position?\n\nThe theory of universal gravitation tells us what things are possible in the solar system; and our conjectures about the nature of this ring must always be regulated by the circumstance of its gravitation to the planet. Philosophers had at first supposed it to be a luminous atmosphere, thrown out into that form by the great centrifugal force arising from a rotation: but its well-defined edge, and, in particular, its being two very narrow rings, extremely near each other, yet perfectly separate, rendered this opinion of its constitution more improbable.\n\nDr Herschel's discovery of brighter spots on its surface, and that those spots were permanent during the whole time of his observation, seem to make it more probable that the parts of the ring have a solid connection. Mr Herschel has discovered, by the help of those spots, that the ring turns round its axis, and that this axis is also the axis of Saturn's rotation. The time of rotation is 10h. 32' 4\". But the other circumstances are not narrated with the precision sufficient for an accurate comparison with the theory of gravity. He informs us, that the radii of the four edges of the ring are 590, 751, 774, 839, of a certain scale, and that the angle subtended by the ring at the mean distance from the earth is 46\u00b0 47'. Therefore its elongation is 23\u00b0 47'. The elongation of the second Cassiniian satellite is 5\u00b0 6', and its revolution is 2d. 17h. 44m. This should give, by the third law of Kepler, 17h. 10m for the revolution of the outer edge of the ring, or rather of an atom of that edge, in order that it may maintain itself in equilibrium. The same calculation applied to the outer edge of the inner ring gives about 13h. 36m; and we obtain 11h. 16m for the inner edge of this ring. Such varieties are inconsistent with the permanent appearance of a spot. We may suppose the ring to be a luminous fluid or vapour, each particle of which maintains its situation by the law of planetary revolution. In such a state, it would consist of concentric strata, revolving more slowly as they were more remote from the planet, like the concentric strata of a vortex, and therefore having a relative motion <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with the permanency of any spot.\n\nBesides, the rotation observed by Herschel is too rapid even for the innermost part of the ring. We think therefore that it consists of cohering matter, and of considerable tenacity, at least equal to that of a very clammy fluid, such as melted glass.\n\nWe can tell the figure which a fluid ring must have, so that it may maintain its form by the mutual gravitation of its particles to each other, and their gravitation to the planet. Suppose it cut by a meridian. It may be in equilibrium if the section is an ellipse, of which the longer axis is directed to the centre of the planet, and very small in comparison with its distance from the centre of the planet, and having the revolution of its middle round Saturn, such as agree with the Keplerian law. These circumstances are not very consistent with the dimensions of Saturn's inner ring. The distance between the middle of its breadth and the centre of Saturn is 670, and its breadth is 161', nearly one-fourth of the distance from the centre of Saturn. De la Place says, that the revolution of the inner ring observed by Herschel is very nearly that required by Kepler's law: but we cannot see the grounds of this assertion. The above comparison with the second Cassiniian satellite shows the contrary. The elongation of that satellite is taken from Bradley's observations, as is also its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PERIODIC\">periodic</a> time. A ring of detached particles revolving in 10h. 32' 4\" must be of much smaller diameter than even the inner edge of Saturn's ring. Indeed the quantity of matter in it might be such as to increase the gravitation considerably; but this would be seen by its disturbing the seventh and fifth satellites, which are exceedingly near it. We cannot help thinking therefore that it consists of matter which has very considerable consistent tenacity. An equatorial zone of matter, tenacious like melted glass, and whirled briskly round, might be thrown off, and, retaining its great velocity, would stretch out while whirling, enlarging in diameter and diminishing in thickness or breadth, or both, till the centrifugal force was balanced by the united force of gravity.\ngravity and tenacity. We find that the equilibrium will not be sensibly disturbed by considerable deviations, such as equal breadth, or even want of flatness. Such inequalities appear on the ring at that time of its disappearance, when its edge is turned to the sun or to us. The appearances of its different sides are then considerably different.\n\nSuch a ring or rings must have an oscillatory motion round the centre of Saturn, in consequence of their mutual action, and the action of the sun, and their own irregularities; but there will be a certain position which they have a tendency to maintain, and to which they will be brought back, after deviating from it, by the ellipticity of Saturn, which is very great. The sun will occasion a nutation of Saturn's axis and a precession of his equinoxes, and this will drag along with it both the rings and the neighbouring satellites.\n\nThe atmosphere which surrounds a whirling planet cannot have all its parts circulating according to the third law of Kepler. The mutual attrition of the planet, and of the different strata, arising from their different velocities, must accelerate the slowly moving strata, and retard the rapid, till all acquire a velocity proportional to their distance from the axis of rotation; and this will be such that the momentum of rotation of the planet and its atmosphere remains always the same. It will fweel out at the equator, and sink at the poles, till the centrifugal force at the equator balances the height of a superficial particle. The greatest ratio which the equatorial diameter can acquire to the polar axis is that of four to three, unless a cohesive force keeps the particles united, so that it constitutes a liquid, and not an elastic fluid like air; and an elastic fluid cannot form an atmosphere bounded in its dimensions, unless there be a certain rarity which takes away all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>. If the equator swells beyond the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a> which makes the gravitation balance the centrifugal force, it must immediately dilate.\n\nIf we suppose that the atmosphere has extended to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a>, and then condenses by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, or any chemical or other cause different from gravity, its rotation necessarily augments, preferring its former momentum, and the limit will approach the axis; because a greater velocity produces a greater centrifugal force, and requires a greater gravitation to balance it. Such an atmosphere may therefore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a>, in succession, zones of its own matter in the plane of its equator, and leave them revolving in the form of rings. It is not unlikely that the rings of Saturn may have been furnished in this very way; and the zones, having acquired a common velocity in their different strata, will preserve it; and they are susceptible of irregularities arising from local causes at the time of their separation, which may afford permanent spots.\n\nSect. VII. Of the Atmospheres of the Planets.\n\nBy atmosphere is meant a rare, transparent, compressible, and elastic fluid surrounding a body. It is supposed that all the heavenly bodies possess atmospheres. The atmosphere of the earth is familiar to all its inhabitants. Observation points out the atmospheres of the sun and of Jupiter; but that of the other planets is scarcely perceptible.\n\nThe atmosphere becomes rarer in proportion to its distance from the body to which it belongs, in consequence of its elasticity, which causes it to dilate the more the less it is compressed. If its most remote parts were still possessed of elasticity, they would separate indefinitely, and the whole would be scattered through space. To prevent this effect it is necessary that the elasticity should diminish at a greater rate than the compressing force, and that when it reaches a certain degree of rarity its elasticity should vanish altogether.\n\nAll the atmospheric strata must gradually acquire the same rotatory motion with the bodies to which they belong in consequence of the continual friction to which their different parts must be subjected, which will gradually accelerate or retard the different parts till a common motion is produced. In all these changes, and indeed in all those which the atmosphere undergoes, the sum of the products of the particles of the body and of its atmosphere multiplied by the areas described round their common centres of gravity by their radii vectors projected in the plane of the equator continue always the same, the times being the same. If we suppose then, by any cause whatever, the height of the atmosphere is diminished, and a portion of it condenses on the surface of the planet; the consequence will be, that the rotatory motion of the planet and of its atmosphere will be accelerated. For the radii vectors of the areas described by the particles of the primitive atmosphere becoming shorter, the sum of the products of all these particles by the corresponding areas cannot remain the same unless the rotatory motion augment.\n\nAt the upper surface of the atmosphere the fluid is retained only by its weight. Its figure is such that the direction resulting from the combination of the centrifugal forces and the attracting forces is perpendicular to it. It is flattened at the poles, and more convex at the equator. But this flattening has its limits. When a maximum the axis of the poles is to that at the equator as 2 to 3.\n\nAt the equator the atmosphere can only extend to the place where the centrifugal force and gravitation exactly balance each other; for if it pass that limit, it will be dissipated altogether. Hence it follows that the solar atmosphere does not extend as far as Mercury; consequently it is not the cause of the zodiacal light which appears to extend even beyond the earth's orbit.\n\nThe place where the centrifugal force and gravitation balance each other is so much the nearer a body the more rapid its rotatory motion is. If we suppose the atmosphere to extend to that limit, and then to condense by cooling, &c., at the surface of the planet the rotatory motion will increase in rapidity in proportion to this condensation, and the limit of the height of the atmosphere will constantly approach the planet. The atmosphere would of course abandon successively zones of fluid in the plane of the equator, which would continue to circulate round the body. We have shown in the last section that Saturn's ring may owe its origin to this cause.\n\nWe may add also, that the action of another body may considerably change the constitution of this reason why atmosphere. Thus, supposing that the moon had originally an atmosphere, the limit will be that distance from the moon where the centrifugal force, arising from the moon's rotation, added to the gravitation...\nSect. VII. Of the Tides.\n\nThe cause of the tides was discovered by Kepler, who, in his Introduction to the Physics of the Heavens, thus explains it: \"The orb of the attracting power which is in the moon, is extended as far as the earth; and draws the waters under the torrid zone, acting upon places where it is vertical, infiniby on confined seas and bays, but sensibly on the ocean, whose beds are large, and where the waters have the liberty of reciprocation, that is, of rising and falling.\" And in the 7th page of his Lunar Astronomy\u2014\"But the cause of the tides of the sea appears to be the bodies of the sun and moon drawing the waters of the sea.\" This hint being given, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a> Sir Isaac Newton improved it, and wrote so amply on the subject, as to make the theory of the tides in a manner quite his own, by discovering the cause of their rising on the side of the earth opposite to the moon. For Kepler believed that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of the moon occasioned an impulse which caused another in her absence.\n\nIt has been already observed, that the power of gravity diminishes as the square of the distance increases; and therefore the waters at Z on the side of the earth ABCDEFGH next the moon M, are more attracted than the central parts of the earth O by the moon, and the central parts are more attracted by her than the waters on the opposite side of the earth at n; and therefore the distance between the earth's centre and the waters on its surface under and opposite to the moon will be increased. For, let there be three bodies at H, O, and D; if they are all equally attracted by the body M, they will all move equally fast towards it, their mutual distances from each other continuing the same. If the attraction of M is unequal, then that body which is most strongly attracted will move fastest, and this will increase its distance from the other body. Therefore, by the law of gravitation, M will attract H more strongly than it does O, by which the distance between H and O will be increased; and a spectator on O will perceive H rising higher toward Z. In like manner, O being more strongly attracted than D, it will move farther towards M than D does; consequently, the distance between O and D will be increased; and a spectator on O, not perceiving his own motion, will see D receding farther from him towards n; all effects and appearances being the same, whether D recedes from O, or O from D.\n\nSuppose now there is a number of bodies, as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, placed round O, so as to form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> or fluid ring; then, as the whole is attracted towards M, the parts at H and D will have their distance from O increased; whilst the parts at B and F being nearly at the same distance from M as O is, these parts will not recede from one another; but rather, by the oblique attraction of M, they will approach nearer to O. Hence the fluid ring will form itself into an ellipse ZIBLaKFNZ, whose larger axis nOZ produced will pass through M, and its shorter axis BOF will terminate in B and F. Let the ring be filled with fluid particles, so as to form a sphere round O; then, as the whole moves towards M, the fluid sphere being lengthened at Z and n, will assume an oblong or oval form. If M is the moon, O the earth's centre, ABC DEFGH the sea covering the earth's surface, it is evident, by the above reasoning, that whilst the earth by its gravity falls towards the moon, the water directly below her at B will swell and rise gradually towards her; also the water at D will recede from the centre [strictly speaking, the centre recedes from D], and rise on the opposite side of the earth; whilst the water at B and F is depressed, and falls below the former level. Hence as the earth turns round its axis from the moon to the moon again in 24\u00bd hours, there will be two tides of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a> and two of ebb in that time, as we find by experience.\n\nAs this explanation of the ebbing and flowing of the Why the sea is deduced from the earth's constantly falling towards the moon by the power of gravity, some may find difficulty in conceiving how this is possible, when the moon is full, or in opposition to the sun; since the earth revolves about the sun, and must continually fall towards it, and therefore cannot fall contrary ways at the same time; or if the earth is constantly falling towards the moon, they must come together at last. To remove this difficulty, let it be considered, that it is not the centre of the earth that describes the annual orbit round the sun, but the (e) common centre of gravity of the earth and moon together; and that whilst the earth is moving round the sun, it also describes a circle round that centre of gravity; going as many times round it in one revolution about the sun as there are lunations or courses of the moon round the earth in a year: and therefore the earth is constantly falling towards the moon from a tangent to the circle it describes round the said common centre of gravity. Let M be the moon, TW part of the moon's orbit, and C the centre of gravity of the earth and moon; whilst the moon goes round her orbit, the centre of the earth describes the circle d'g'e' round C, to which circle g'a'k' is a tangent; and therefore when the moon has gone from M to a little pall W, the earth has moved from g to e'; and in that time has fallen towards the moon, from the tangent at a to e': and so on, round the whole circle.\n\nThe sun's influence in raising the tides is but small in\n\n(e) This centre is as much nearer the earth's centre than the moon's as the earth is heavier, or contains a greater quantity of matter than the moon, namely, about 40 times. If both bodies were suspended on it, they would hang in equilibrium. So that dividing 240,000 miles, the moon's distance from the earth's centre, by 40, the excess of the earth's weight above the moon's, the quotient will be 6000 miles, which is the distance of the common centre of gravity of the earth and moon from the earth's centre.\nTheory of Universal Gravitation.\n\nIn comparison of the moon's; for though the earth's diameter bears a considerable proportion to its distance from the moon, it is next to nothing when compared to its distance from the sun. And therefore the difference of the sun's attraction on the sides of the earth under and opposite to him, is much less than the difference of the moon's attraction on the sides of the earth under and opposite to her; and therefore the moon must raise the tides much higher than they can be raised by the sun.\n\nOn this theory, the tides ought to be highest directly under and opposite to the moon; that is, when the moon is due north and south. But we find, that in open seas, where the water flows freely, the moon M is generally past the north and south meridian, as at p, when it is high water at Z and at n. The reason is obvious: for though the moon's attraction was to cease altogether when she was past the meridian, yet the motion of ascent communicated to the water before that time would make it continue to rise for some time after; much more must it do so when the attraction is only diminished; as a little impulse given to a moving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> will cause it still to move farther than otherwise it could have done; and as experience shows that the day is hotter about three in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a>, than when the sun is on the meridian, because of the increase made to the heat already imparted.\n\nThe tides answer not always to the same distance of the moon from the meridian at the same places; but are variously affected by the action of the sun, which brings them on sooner when the moon is in her first and third quarters, and keeps them back later when she is in her second and fourth: because, in the former case, the tide raised by the sun alone would be earlier than the tide raised by the moon: and, in the latter case, later.\n\nThe moon goes round the earth in an elliptic orbit; and therefore, in every lunar month, she approaches nearer to the earth than her mean distance, and recedes farther from it. When she is nearest, she attracts strongest, and so raises the tides most: the contrary happens when she is farthest, because of her weaker attraction. When both luminaries are in the equator, and the moon in perigee, or at her least distance from the earth, she raises the tides highest of all, especially at her conjunction and opposition; both because the equatorial parts have the greatest centrifugal force from their describing the largest circle, and from the concurring actions of the sun and moon. At the change, the attractive forces of the sun and moon being united, they diminish the gravity of the waters under the moon, and their gravity on the opposite side is diminished by means of a greater centrifugal force. At the full, whilst the moon raises the tide under and opposite to her, the sun, acting in the same line, raises the tide under and opposite to him; whence their conjoint effect is the same as at the change; and, in both cases, occasion what we call the Spring Tides. But at the quarters the sun's action on the waters at O and H diminishes the effect of the moon's action on the waters at Z and N; so that they rise a little under and opposite to the sun at O and H, and fall as much under and opposite to the moon at Z and N; making what we call the Neap Tides, because the sun and moon then act cross-wise to each other. But these tides happen not till some time after; because in this, as in other cases, the actions do not produce the greatest effect when they are at the strongest, but some time afterward.\n\nThe sun being nearer the earth in winter than in summer, is of course nearer to it in February and October than in March and September; and therefore the greatest tides happen not till some time after the autumnal equinox, and return a little before the vernal.\n\nThe sea, being thus put in motion, would continue to ebb and flow for several times, even though the sun and moon were annihilated, or their influence should cease; as, if a basin of water were agitated, the water would continue to move for some time after the basin was left to stand still; or like a pendulum, which, having been put in motion by the hand, continues to make several vibrations without any new impulse.\n\nWhen the moon is in the equator, the tides are equally high in both parts of the lunar day, or time of the moon's revolving from the meridian to the meridian again, which is 24 hours 50 minutes. But as the moon declines from the equator towards either pole, the tides are alternately higher and lower at places having north or south latitude. For one of the highest elevations, which is that under the moon, follows her towards the pole to which she is nearest, and the other declines towards the opposite pole; each elevation describing parallels as far distant from the equator, on opposite sides, as the moon declines from it to either side; and consequently the parallels described by these elevations of the water are twice as many degrees from one another as the moon is from the equator; increasing their distance as the moon increases her declination, till it be at the greatest, when the said parallels are, at a mean state, 47 degrees from one another; and on that day, the tides are most unequal in their heights. As the moon returns towards the equator, the parallels described by the opposite elevations approach towards each other, until the moon comes to the equator, and then they coincide. As the moon declines towards the opposite pole, at equal distances, each elevation describes the same parallel in the other part of the lunar day, which its opposite elevation described before. Whilst the moon has north declination, the greatest tides in the northern hemisphere are when she is above the horizon; and the reverse whilst her declination is south. Let NESQ be the earth, NSC its axis, EQ Fig. 151, the equator, T the tropic of Cancer, r the tropic of Capricorn, a b the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCTIC\">arctic</a> circle, c d the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANTARCTIC\">antarctic</a>, N the north pole, S the south pole, M the moon, F and G the two eminences of water, whose lowest parts are, at a and d, at N and S, and at b and c, always go degrees from the highest. Now, when the moon is in her greatest north declination at M, the highest elevation G under her is on the tropic of Cancer T; and the opposite elevation F on the tropic of Capricorn r; and these two elevations describe the tropics by the earth's diurnal rotation. All places in the northern hemisphere ENQ have the highest tides when they come into the position b Q, under the moon; and the lowest tides when the earth's diurnal rotation carries them into the position a TE, on the side opposite to the moon; the reverse happens at the same time in the southern hemisphere ESQ, as is evident to sight.\nTheory of The axis of the tides a C d had now its poles a and d (being always 90 degrees from the highest elevations) in the arctic and antarctic circles; and therefore it is plain, that at these circles there is but one tide of flood, and one of ebb, in the lunar day. For, when the point a revolves half round to b in 12 lunar hours, it has a tide of flood; but when it comes to the same point a again in 12 hours more, it has the lowest ebb.\n\nIn seven days afterward, the moon M comes to the equinoctial circle, and is over the equator EQ, when both elevations describe the equator; and in both hemispheres, at equal distances from the equator, the tides are equally high in both parts of the lunar day. The whole phenomena being reversed, when the moon has south declination, to what they were when her declination was north, require no farther description.\n\nIn the three last-mentioned figures, the earth is orthographically projected on the plane of the meridian; but in order to describe a particular phenomenon, we now project it on the plane of the ecliptic. Let HZON be the earth and sea, FED the equator, T the tropic of Cancer, C the arctic circle, P the north pole, and the curves, 1, 2, 3, &c., 24 meridians or hour circles, intersecting each other in the poles: AGM is the moon's orbit, S the sun, M the moon, Z the water elevated under the moon, and N the opposite equal elevation. As the lowest parts of the water are always 90 degrees from the highest, when the moon is in either of the tropics (as at N), the elevation Z is on the tropic of Capricorn; and the opposite elevation N on the tropic of Cancer; the low-water circle HCO touches the polar circles at C; and the high-water circle FTP goes over the poles at P, and divides every parallel of latitude into two equal segments. In this case, the tides upon every parallel are alternately higher and lower; but they return in equal times: the point T, for example, on the tropic of Cancer, (where the depth of the tide is represented by the breadth of the dark shade) has the shallower tide of flood at T than when it revolves half round from thence to 6, according to the order of the numeral figures; but it revolves as soon from 6 to T as it did from T to 6. When the moon is in the equinoctial, the elevations Z and N are transferred to the equator at O and H, and the high and low-water circles are got into each other's former places; in which case the tides return in unequal times, but are equally high in both parts of the lunar day; for a place at I (under D) revolving as formerly, goes sooner from I to II (under F) than from II to I, because the parallel it describes is cut into unequal segments by the high-water circle HCO; but the points I and II, being equidistant from the pole of the tides at C, which is directly under the pole of the moon's orbit MGA, the elevations are equally high in both parts of the day.\n\nAnd thus it appears, that as the tides are governed by the moon, they must turn on the axis on the moon's orbit, which is inclined 23\u00b0 degrees to the earth's axis at a mean state: and therefore the poles of the tides must be so many degrees from the poles of the earth, or in opposite points of the polar circles, going round these circles in every lunar day. It is true, that according to fig. 153, when the moon is vertical to the equator EQ, the poles of the tides seem to fall in with the poles of the world N and S: but when we consider that FGH is under the moon's orbit, it will appear, that when the moon is over H, in the tropic of Capricorn, the north pole of the tides (which can be no more than 90 degrees from under the moon) must be at C in the arctic circle, not at P the north pole of the earth; and as the moon ascends from H to G in her orbit, the north pole of the tides must shift from c to a in the arctic circle, and the south poles as much in the antarctic.\n\nIt is not to be doubted, but that the earth's quick rotation brings the poles of the tides nearer to the poles of the world than they would be if the earth were at rest, and the moon revolved about it only once a month; for otherwise the tides would be more unequal in their heights and times of their returns, than we find they are. But how near the earth's rotation may bring the poles of its axis and those of the tides together, or how far the preceding tides may affect those which follow, so as to make them keep up nearly to the same heights and times of ebbing and flowing, is a problem more fit to be solved by observation than by theory.\n\nThose who have opportunity to make observations, and choose to satisfy themselves whether the tides are really affected in the above manner by the different positions of the moon, especially as to the unequal times of their return, may take this general rule for knowing when they ought to be so affected. When the earth's axis inclines to the moon, the northern tides, if not retarded in their passage through foals and channels, nor affected by the winds, ought to be greatest when the moon is above the horizon, least when she is below it, and quite the reverse when the earth's axis declines from her; but in both cases, at equal intervals of time. When the earth's axis inclines sidewise to the moon, both tides are equally high, but they happen at unequal intervals of time. In every lunation the earth's axis inclines once to the moon, once from her, and twice sidewise to her, as it does to the sun every year; because the moon goes round the ecliptic every month, and the sun but once in a year. In summer, the earth's axis inclines towards the moon when new; and therefore the day-tides in the north ought to be highest, and night-tides lowest, about the change: at the full, the reverse. At the quarters, they ought to be equally high, but unequal in their returns: because the earth's axis then inclines sidewise to the moon. In winter, the phenomena are the same at full moon as in summer at new. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a> the earth's axis inclines sidewise to the moon when new and full; therefore the tides ought to be equally high and uneven in their returns at these times. At the first quarter, the tides of flood should be least when the moon is above the horizon, greatest when she is below it; and the reverse at her third quarter. In spring, the phenomena of the first quarter answer to those of the third quarter in autumn; and vice versa. The nearer any tide is to either of the feasts, the more the tides-partake of the phenomena of these feasts; and in the middle between any two of them the tides are at a mean state between those of both.\n\nIn open seas, the tides rise but to very small heights in proportion to what they do in wide-mouthed rivers, opening in the direction of the stream of tide. For in channels growing narrower gradually, the water is accumulated.\nTheory of cumulated by the opposition of the contracting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>; like a gentle wind, little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> on an open plain, but strong and brisk in a street; especially if the wider end of the street be next the plain, and in the way of the wind.\n\nThe tides are so retarded in their passage through different foals and channels, and otherwise so variously affected by striking against capes and headlands, that to different places they happen at all distances of the moon from the meridian, consequently at all hours of the lunar day. The tide propagated by the moon in the German ocean, when she is three hours past the meridian, takes 12 hours to come from thence to London <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>, where it arrives by the time that a new tide is raised in the ocean. And therefore, when the moon has north declination, and we should expect the tide at London to be greatest when the moon is above the horizon, we find it least; and the contrary when she has south declination. At several places it is high water three hours before the moon comes to the meridian; but that tide which the moon pushes as it was before her, is only the tide opposite to that which was raised by her when she was nine hours past the opposite meridian.\n\nThere are no tides in lakes, because they are generally so small, that when the moon is vertical she attracts every part of them alike, and therefore by rendering all the water equally light, no part of it can be raised higher than another. The Mediterranean and Baltic seas have very small elevations, because the inlets by which they communicate with the ocean are so narrow, that they cannot, in so short a time, receive or discharge enough to raise or sink their surfaces sensibly.\n\nFor a more complete discussion of this important subject, we refer the reader to the article Tide.\n\nSect. IX. Of the Precession of the Equinoxes, and the Nutation of the Earth's Axis.\n\nIt now remains to consider the precession of the equinoctial points, with its equations, arising from the nutation of the earth's axis as a physical phenomenon, and to endeavour to account for it upon those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> principles which have so happily explained all the other phenomena of the celestial motions.\n\nThis did not escape the penetrating eye of Sir Isaac Newton; and he quickly found it to be a consequence, and the most beautiful proof, of the universal gravitation of all matter to all matter; and there is no part of his immortal work where his sagacity and fertility of resource shine more conspicuously than in this investigation. It must be acknowledged, however, that Newton's investigation is only a firework guess, founded on assumptions, of which it would be extremely difficult to demonstrate either the truth or falsity, and which required the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of a Newton to pick out in such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-COMPLICATION\">complication</a> of arbitrary circumstances. The subject has occupied the attention of the first mathematicians of Europe since his time; and is still considered as the most curious and difficult of all mechanical problems. The most elaborate and accurate dissertations on the precession of the equinoxes are those of Sylvabell and Walmelly, in the Philosophical Transactions, published about the year 1754; that of Thomas Simpson, published in his Miscellaneous Tracts; that of Father Frisius, in the Memoirs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a> Academy, and afterwards, with great improvements, in his Cosmographia; that of Euler in the Memoirs of Berlin; that of D'Alembert in a separate dissertation; and that of De la Grange on the Liberation of the Moon, which obtained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> in the Academy of Paris in 1760. We think the dissertation of Father Frisius the most perspicuous of them all, being conducted in the method of geometrical analysis; whereas most of the others proceed in the luxuriant and symbolic method, which is frequently deficient in distinct notions of the quantities under consideration, and therefore does not give us the same perspicuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> of the truth of the results. In a work like ours, it is impossible to do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to the problem, without entering into a detail which would be thought extremely disproportionate to the subject by the generality of our readers. Yet those who have the necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of mathematical knowledge, and will to understand the subject fully, will find enough here to give them a very distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of it; and in the article Rotation, they will find the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> theorems, which will enable them to carry on the investigation. We shall first give a short sketch of Newton's investigation, which is of the most palpable and popular kind, and is highly valuable, not only for its ingenuity, but also because it will give our unlearned readers distinct and satisfactory conceptions of the chief circumstances of the whole phenomena.\n\nLet S (fig. 154.) be the sun, E the earth, and M the moon, moving in the orbit NMCDn, which cuts the plane of the ecliptic in the line of the nodes Nn, and has one half raised above it, as represented in the figure, the other half being hid below the ecliptic. Suppose this orbit folded down; it will coincide with the ecliptic in the circle Nmc'd'n. Let EX represent the axis of this orbit, perpendicular to its plane, and therefore inclined to the ecliptic. Since the moon gravitates to the sun in the direction MS, which is all above the ecliptic, it is plain that this gravitation has a tendency to draw the moon towards the ecliptic. Suppose this force to be such that it would draw the moon down from M to r, in the time that she would have moved from M to r, in the tangent to her orbit. By the combination of these motions, the moon will deflect her orbit, and describe the line Mr, which makes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DIAGONAL\">diagonal</a> of the parallelogram; and if no farther action of the sun be supposed, she will describe another orbit M3'n', lying between the orbit MCDn and the ecliptic, and she will come to the ecliptic, and pass through it in a point n', nearer to M than n, which was the former place of her ascending node. By this change of orbit, the line EX will no longer be perpendicular to it; but there will be another line Ex, which will now be perpendicular to the new orbit. Also the moon, moving from M to r, does not move as if she had come from the ascending node N, but from a point N lying beyond it; and the line of the nodes of the orbit in this new position is N'n'. Also the angle MN'm is less than the angle MN'n.\n\nThus the nodes shift their places in a direction opposite to that of her motion, or move to the westward; the axis of the orbit changes its position, and the orbit itself changes its inclination to the ecliptic. These momentary changes are different in different parts of the orbit, according to the position of the line of the nodes.\nTheory of nodes. Sometimes the inclination of the orbit is increased, and sometimes the nodes move to the eastward. But, in general, the inclination increases from the time that the nodes are in the line of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYZYGY\">syzygy</a>, till they get into quadrature, after which it diminishes till the nodes are again in syzygy. The nodes advance only while they are in the octants after the quadratures, and while the moon passes from quadrature to the node, and they recede in all other situations. Therefore the recess exceeds the advance in every revolution of the moon round the earth, and, on the whole, they recede.\n\nWhat has been said of one moon, would be true of each of a continued ring of moons surrounding the earth, and they would thus compose a flexible ring, which would never be flat, but waved, according to the difference (both in kind and degree) of the disturbing forces acting on its different parts. But suppose these moons to cohere, and to form a rigid and flat ring, nothing would remain in this ring but the excess of the contrary tendencies of its different parts. Its axis would be perpendicular to its plane, and its position in any moment will be the mean position of all the axes of the orbits of each part of the flexible ring; therefore the nodes of this rigid ring will continually recede, except when the plane of the ring passes through the sun, that is, when the nodes are in syzygy; and (says Newton) the motion of these nodes will be the same with the mean motion of the nodes of the orbit of one moon. The inclination of this ring to the ecliptic will be equal to the mean inclination of the moon's orbit during any one revolution which has the same situation of the nodes. It will therefore be least of all when the nodes are in quadrature, and will increase till they are in syzygy, and then diminish till they are again in quadrature.\n\nSuppose this ring to contract in dimensions, the disturbing forces will diminish in the same proportion, and in this proportion will all their effects diminish. Suppose its motion of revolution to accelerate, or the time of a revolution to diminish; the linear effects of the disturbing forces being as the squares of the times of their action, and their angular effects as the times, those errors must diminish also on this account; and we can compute what those errors will be for any diameter of the ring, and for any period of its revolution. We can tell, therefore, what would be the motion of the nodes, the change of inclination, and deviation of the axis, of a ring which would touch the surface of the earth, and revolved in 24 hours; nay, we can tell what these motions would be, should this ring adhere to the earth. They must be much less than if the ring were detached; for the disturbing forces of the ring must drag along with it the whole globe of the earth. The quantity of motion which the disturbing forces would have produced in the ring alone, will now (says Newton) be produced in the whole mass; and therefore the velocity must be as much less as the quantity of matter is greater: But still all this can be computed.\n\nNow there is such a ring on the earth: for the earth is not a sphere, but an elliptical spheroid. Sir Isaac Newton therefore engaged in a computation of the effects of the disturbing force, and has exhibited a most beautiful example of mathematical investigation. He first asserts, that the earth must be an elliptical spheroid, whose polar axis is to its equatorial diameter as 229 to 230.\n\nThen he demonstrates, that if the sine of the inclination of the equator be called $\\pi$, and if $t$ be the number of days (sidereal) in a year, the annual motion of a detached ring will be $360^\\circ \\times \\frac{3\\sqrt{1-\\pi^2}}{4t}$. He then shows that the effect of the disturbing force on this ring is to its effect on the matter of the same ring, distributed in the form of an elliptical stratum (but still detached) as 5 to 2; therefore the motion of the nodes will be $360^\\circ \\times \\frac{3\\sqrt{1-\\pi^2}}{10t}$, or $16' 16'' 24'''$ annually. He then proceeds to show, that the quantity of motion in the sphere is to that in an equatorial ring revolving in the same time, as the matter in the sphere to the matter in the ring, and as three times the square of a quadrant arch to two squares of a diameter, jointly. Then he shows, that the quantity of matter in the terrestrial sphere is to that in the protuberant matter of the spheroid, as 52900 to 461 (supposing all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMOGENEOUS\">homogeneous</a>). From these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREMISES\">premises</a> it follows, that the motion of $16' 16'' 24'''$, must be diminished in the ratio of 10717 to 100, which reduces it to $9' 07''$ annually. And this (he says) is the precession of the equinoxes, occasioned by the action of the sun; and the rest of the $50''$, which is the observed precession, is owing to the action of the moon, nearly five times greater than that of the sun. This appeared a great difficulty: for the phenomena of the tides show that it cannot much exceed twice the sun's force.\n\nNothing can exceed the ingenuity of this process. His description justly does his celebrated and candid commentator, Daniel Bernoulli, say (in his Dissertation on the Tides, of the form which shared the prize of the French Academy with M'Laurin and Euler), that Newton saw through a veil earth demonstrated in the light of the meridian sun. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> of the form and dimensions of the earth, which is the foundation of the whole process, is not offered as anything better than a probable guess, in re difficillima; and it has been since demonstrated with geometrical rigour by M'Laurin.\n\nHis next principle, that the motion of the nodes of the rigid ring is equal to the mean motion of the nodes of the moon, has been most critically discussed by the first mathematicians, as a thing which could neither be proved nor refuted. Frisius has at least shown it to be a mistake, and that the motion of the nodes of the ring is double the mean motion of the nodes of a single moon; and that Newton's own principles should have produced a precession of 184 seconds annually, which removes the difficulty formerly mentioned.\n\nHis third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a>, that the quantity of motion of the ring must be shared with the included sphere, was acquiesced in by all his commentators, till D'Alembert and Euler, in 1749, showed that it was not the quantity of motion round an axis of rotation which remained the same, but the quantity of momentum or rotary effort. The quantity of motion is the product of every particle by its velocity; that is, by its distance from the axis; while its momentum, or power of producing rotation, is as the square of that distance, and is to be had by taking the sum of each particle multiplied by the square of its distance from the axis. Since the earth...\nearth differs so little from a perfect sphere, this makes no sensible difference in the result. It will increase Newton's precession about three-fourths of a second.\n\nWe proceed now to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of this phenomenon upon the fundamental principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>.\n\nBecause the mutual gravitation of the particles of matter in the solar system is in the inverse ratio of the squares of the distance, it follows, that the gravitations of the different parts of the earth to the sun or to the moon are unequal. The nearer particles gravitate more than those that are more remote.\n\nLet $PQ \\rho E$ (fig. 155.) be a meridional section of the terrestrial sphere, and $PO \\rho P$ the section of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> sphere. Let $CS$ be a line in the plane of the ecliptic passing through the sun, so that the angle $ECS$ is the sun's declination. Let $NCM$ be a plane passing through the centre of the earth at right angles to the plane of the meridian $PQ \\rho E$; $NCM$ will therefore be the plane of illumination.\n\nIn consequence of the unequal gravitation of the matter of the earth to the sun, every particle, such as $B$, is acted on by a disturbing force parallel to $CS$, and proportional to $BD$, the distance of the particle from the plane of illumination; and this force is to the gravitation of the central particle to the sun, as three times $BD$ is to $CS$, the distance of the earth from the sun.\n\nLet $<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABA\">ABa</a>$ be a plane passing through the particle $B$, parallel to the plane $EQ$ of the equator. This section of the earth will be a circle, of which $Aa$ is a diameter, and $Qq$ will be the diameter of its section with the inscribed sphere. There will be two concentric circles, and the ring by which the section of the spheroid exceeds the section of the sphere will have $AQ$ for its breadth; $PP$ is the axis of figure.\n\nLet $OC$ be represented by the symbol $a$, $PC$ by $b$, $EO$ their difference, $\\frac{a^2 - b^2}{a + b}$, $CL$ by $x$, $QL$ by $\\sqrt{d^2 - x^2}$, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PERIPHERY\">periphery</a> of a circle to radius $i$, $f$ the disturbing force at the distance $i$ from the plane $NCM$, $m$ the fine of declination $ECS$, $n$ the cosine of $ECS$.\n\nIt is evident, that with respect to the inscribed sphere, the disturbing forces are completely compensated, for every particle has a corresponding particle in the adjoining quadrant, which is acted on by an equal and opposite force. But this is not the case with the protuberant matter which makes up the spheroid. The segments $NS$ and $MT$ are more acted on than the segments $NT$ and $MS$; and thus there is produced a tendency to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSION\">conversion</a> of the whole earth, round an axis passing through the centre $C$, perpendicular to the plane $PQ \\rho E$. We shall distinguish this motion from all others to which the spheroid may be subject, by the name Libration. The axis of this libration is always perpendicular to that diameter of the equator over which the sun is, or to that meridian in which he is.\n\nProb. I. To determine the momentum of libration corresponding to any position of the earth respecting the sun, that is, to determine the accumulated energy of the disturbing forces on all the protuberant matter of the spheroid.\n\nLet $B$ and $b$ be two particles in the ring formed by the revolution of $AQ$, and so situated that they are at equal distances from the plane $NM$; but on opposite sides of it. Draw $BD$, $bd$, perpendicular to $NM$, and $FLG$ perpendicular to $LT$.\n\nThen, because the momentum, or power of producing rotation, is as the force and as the distance of its line of direction from the axis of rotation, jointly, the combined momentum of the particles $B$ and $b$, will be $f.BD.DC = f.bbdde$ (for the particles $B$ and $b$, are urged in contrary directions). But the momentum of $B$ is $f.BF.DC + f.FD.DC$, and that of $b$ is $f.b.G.dC - f.dG.aC$; and the combined momentum is $f.BF.DC - f.FD.DC + dC = 2f.BF.LF - 2f.LT.TC$.\n\nBecause $m$ and $n$ are the sine and cosine of the angle $ECS$ or $LCT$, we have $LT = m.CL$, and $CT = n.CL$, and $LF = m.BL$, and $BF = n.BL$. This gives the momentum $= 2f.m.n.BL^2 - CL^2$.\n\nThe breadth $AQ$ of the protuberant ring being very small, we may suppose, without any sensible error, that all the matter of the line $AQ$ is collected in the point $Q$; and, in like manner, that the matter of the whole ring is collected in the circumference of its inner circle, and that $B$ and $b$ now represent, not single particles, but the collected matter of lines such as $AQ$, which terminate at $B$ and $b$. The combined momentum of two such lines will therefore be $2m.n.f.AQ.BL^2 - CL^2$.\n\nLet the circumference of each parallel of latitude be divided into a great number of indefinitely small and equal parts. The number of such parts in the circumference, of which $Qq$ is the diameter will be $\\pi.QL$. To each pair of these there belongs a momentum $2m.n.f.AQ.BL^2 - CL^2$. The sum of all the squares of $BL$, which can be taken round the circle, is one half of as many squares of the radius $CL$; for $BL$ is the fine of an arch, and the sum of its square and the square of its corresponding cosine is equal to the square of the radius. Therefore the sum of all the squares of the fines, together with the sum of all the squares of the cosines, is equal to the sum of the same number of squares of the radius; and the sum of the squares of the fines is equal to the sum of the squares of the corresponding cosines; therefore the sum of the squares of the radius is double of either sum. Therefore $\\sqrt{\\pi.QL} \\cdot BL = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi.QL.CL^2$. In like manner the sum of the number $\\pi.QL$ of $CL^2$ will be $\\pi.QL.CL^2$. These sums, taken for the semicircle, are $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi.QL^2$, and $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi.QL^2$, or $\\pi.QL^2$, and $\\pi.QL^2$: therefore the momentum of the whole ring will be $2m.n.f.AQ.QL.\\pi(\\frac{1}{2}QL^2 - \\frac{1}{2}CL^2)$: for the momentum of the ring is the combined momenta of a number of pairs, and this number is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi.QL$.\n\nBy the ellipse we have $OC : QL = EO : AQ$, and $AQ = QL \\cdot EO / OC$, $= QL \\cdot d / b$; therefore the momentum of the ring is $2m.n.f.QL^2\\pi(\\frac{1}{2}QL^2 - \\frac{1}{2}CL^2)$, $= m.n.f.d / b QL^2 (\\frac{1}{2}QL^2 - \\frac{1}{2}CL^2)$: but $QL^2 = b^2 - x^2$; therefore $\\frac{1}{2}QL^2$.\ntherefore the momentum of the ring is \\( m n f \\frac{d}{2b} \\Pi (b^3 - b^3 x^3 + 3x^3) \\)\n\n\\( = m n f \\frac{d}{2b} \\Pi \\left( \\frac{b^3 - b^3 x^3 + 3x^3}{2} \\right) \\), \\( = m n f \\frac{d}{2b} \\Pi \\left( \\frac{b^3 - 4b^3 x^3 + 3x^3}{2} \\right) \\).\n\nIf we now suppose another parallel extremely near to A a, as represented by the dotted line, the distance L l between them being \\( x \\), we shall have the fluxion of the momentum of the spheroid\n\n\\( m n f \\frac{d}{2b} \\Pi (b^3 x - 4b^3 x^3 + 3x^3) \\), of which the fluent is\n\n\\( m n f \\frac{d}{2b} \\Pi \\left( \\frac{b^3 x - 4b^3 x^3 + 3x^3}{2} \\right) \\). This expresses the momentum of the zone E A a Q, contained between the equator and the parallel of latitude A a. Now let \\( x \\) become \\( = b \\), and we shall obtain the momentum of the hemispheroid \\( = m n f \\frac{d}{2b} \\Pi \\left( \\frac{b^3 - 4b^3 + 3b^3}{2} \\right) \\), and that of the spheroid \\( = m n f \\frac{d}{2b} \\Pi \\left( \\frac{b^3 - 4b^3 + 3b^3}{2} \\right) = \\frac{4}{15} m n f d \\).\n\nThis formula does not express any motion, but only a pressure tending to produce motion, and particularly tending to produce a libration by its action on the cohering matter of the earth, which is affected as a number of levers. It is similar to the common mechanical formula \\( w.d \\), where \\( w \\) means a weight, and \\( d \\) its distance from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FULCRUM\">fulcrum</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a>.\n\nIt is worthy of remark, that the momentum of this protuberant matter is just \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of what it would be if it were all collected at the point O of the equator: for the matter in the spheroid is to that in the inscribed sphere as \\( a^3 \\) to \\( b^3 \\); and the contents of the inscribed sphere is \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\pi b^3 \\). Therefore \\( a^3 : b^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi b^3 : \\frac{4}{3} \\pi b^3 \\),\n\n\\( \\frac{a^3 - b^3}{a^3} \\), which is the quantity of protuberant matter. We may, without sensible error, suppose \\( \\frac{a^3 - b^3}{a^3} = 2d \\); then the protuberant matter will be \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\pi b^3 d \\). If all this were placed at O, the momentum would be \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\pi b^3 d \\), because OH HC \\( = m n f d b^3 \\); now \\( d \\) is \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\) times \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n\nAlso, because the sum of all the rectangles OH HC round the equator is half of as many squares of OC, it follows that the momentum of the protuberant matter placed in a ring round the equator of the sphere, or spheroid, is one half of what it would be if collected in the point G or E; whence it follows that the momentum of the protuberant matter in its natural place is two-fifths of what it would be if it were disposed in an equatorial ring. It was in this manner that Sir Isaac Newton was enabled to compare the effect of the sun's action on the protuberant matter of the earth, with his effect on a rigid ring of moons. The preceding investigation of the momentum is nearly the same with his, and appears to us greatly preferable in point of perspicuity to the fluxionary solutions given by later authors. These indeed have the appearance of greater accuracy, because they do not suppose all the protuberant matter to be condensed on the surface of the inscribed sphere: nor were we under the necessity of doing this; only it would have led to very complicated expressions had we supposed the matter in each line AQ collected in its centre of oscillation or gyration. We made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPENSATION\">compensation</a> for the error introduced by this, which may amount to \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\) of the whole, and should not be neglected, by taking \\( d \\) as equal to \\( \\frac{a^3 - b^3}{a + b} \\) instead of \\( \\frac{a^3 - b^3}{a + b} \\). The consequence is, that our formula is the same with that of the later authors.\n\nThus far Sir Isaac Newton proceeded with mathematical rigour; but in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> he made two assumptions, or, as he calls them hypotheses, which have been found to be unwarranted. The first was, that when the ring of protuberant matter is connected with the inscribed sphere, and subjected to the action of the disturbing force, the same quantity of motion is produced in the whole mass as in the ring alone. The second was, that the motion of the nodes of a rigid ring of moons is the same with the mean motion of the nodes of a solitary moon. But we are now able to demonstrate, that it is not the quantity of motion, but of momentum, which remains the same, and that the nodes of a rigid ring move twice as fast as those of a single particle. We proceed therefore to,\n\n**Prop. II.** To determine the deviation of the axis, Effects of the retrograde motion of the nodes which result the libratory motion of the earth's protuberant matter.\n\nBut here we must refer our readers to some fundamental propositions of rotatory motions which are demonstrated in the article Rotation.\n\nIf a rigid body is turning round an axis A, passing through its centre of gravity with the angular velocity \\( a \\), and receives an impulse which alone would cause it to turn round an axis B, also passing through its centre of gravity, with the angular velocity \\( b \\), the body will now turn round a third axis C, passing through its centre of gravity, and lying in the plane of the axes A and B, and the fine of the inclination of this third axis to the axis A will be to the fine of the inclination to the axis B as the velocity \\( b \\) to the velocity \\( a \\).\n\nWhen a rigid body is made to turn round any axis by the action of an external force, the quantity of momentum produced (that is, the sum of the products of every particle by its velocity and by its distance from the axis) is equal to the momentum or similar product of the moving force or forces.\n\nIf an oblate spheroid, whose equatorial diameter is \\( a \\) and polar diameter \\( b \\), be made to librate round an equatorial diameter, and the velocity of that point of the equator which is farthest from the axis of libration be \\( v \\), the momentum of the spheroid is \\( \\frac{4}{15} \\pi a^3 b^3 v \\).\n\nThe two last are to be found in every elementary book of mechanics.\n\nLet AN an (fig. 156.) be the plane of the earth's equator, cutting the ecliptic CNK n in the line of the nodes or equinoctial points N n. Let OAS be the section of the earth by a meridian passing through the sun, so that the line OCS is in the ecliptic, and CA is an arch of an hour-circle or meridian, measuring the sun's declination. The sun not being in the plane of the equator, there is, by prop. i, a force tending to produce a libration round an axis ZO z at right angles to the diameter A a of that meridian in which the sun is situated,\nTheory of Universal Gravitation.\n\nThe momentum of all the disturbing forces is \\( \\frac{4}{3} m n f d \\pi b^4 \\). The product of any force by the moment of its action expresses the momentary increment of velocity; therefore the momentary velocity, or the velocity of libration granted in the time \\( t \\) is \\( \\frac{4}{3} m n f d \\pi b^4 \\).\n\nThis is the absolute velocity of a point at the distance \\( r \\) from the axis, or it is the space which would be uniformly described in the moment \\( t \\), with the velocity which the point has acquired at the end of that moment. It is double the space actually described by the libration during that moment; because this has been an uniformly accelerated motion, in consequence of the continued and uniform action of the momentum during this time. This must be carefully attended to, and the neglect of it has occasioned very faulty solutions of this problem.\n\nLet \\( v \\) be the velocity produced in the point \\( A \\), the most remote from the axis of libration. The momentum excited or produced in the spheroid is \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\pi a^2 b^2 v \\) (as above), and this must be equal to the momentum of the moving force, or to \\( \\frac{4}{3} m n f d \\pi b^4 \\); therefore we obtain \\( v = \\frac{4}{3} m n f d \\pi b^4 \\), that is, \\( v = m n f d \\cdot \\frac{b^4}{a^2} \\) or very nearly \\( m n f d \\), because \\( \\frac{b^4}{a^2} = 1 \\) very nearly. Also, because the product of the velocity and time gives the space uniformly described in that time, the space described by \\( A \\) in its libration round \\( Z \\) is \\( m n f d \\), and the angular velocity is \\( \\frac{m n f d}{a} \\).\n\nLet \\( r \\) be the momentary angle of diurnal rotation. The arch \\( A r \\), described by the point \\( A \\) of the equator in this moment will therefore be \\( a r \\), that is, \\( a \\times r \\), and the velocity of the point \\( A \\) is \\( \\frac{ar}{t} \\), and the angular velocity of rotation is \\( \\frac{r}{t} \\).\n\nHere then is a body (fig. 157.) turning round an axis \\( OP \\), perpendicular to the plane of the equator \\( zoz \\), and therefore situated in the plane \\( ZPz \\); and it turns round this axis with the angular velocity \\( \\frac{r}{t} \\). It has received an impulse, by which alone it would librate round the axis \\( Z \\), with the angular velocity \\( \\frac{m n f d}{a} \\). It will therefore turn round neither axis, but round a third axis \\( OP' \\), passing through \\( O \\), and lying in the plane \\( ZPz \\), in which the other two are situated, and the fine \\( P'P \\) of its inclination to the axis of libration \\( Z \\) will be to the fine \\( P'P \\) of its inclination to the axis \\( OP \\) of rotation as \\( \\frac{r}{t} \\) to \\( \\frac{m n f d}{a} \\).\n\nNow \\( A \\), in fig. 156., is the summit of the equator both of libration and rotation: \\( m n f d \\) is the space described by its libration in the time \\( t \\); and \\( a r \\) is the space or arch \\( A r \\) (fig. 156.), described in the same time by its rotation: therefore, taking \\( A r \\) to \\( A c \\) (perpendicular to the plane of the equator of rotation, and lying in the equator of libration), as \\( a r \\) to \\( m n f d \\), and completing the parallelogram \\( A r mc \\), \\( A m \\) will be the compound motion of \\( A \\), and \\( a r \\) to \\( m n f d \\) as required by the composition of rotations.\n\nIn consequence of this change of position, the plane of the equator no longer cuts the plane of the ecliptic in the line \\( Nn \\). The plane of the new equator cuts the former equator in the line \\( AO \\), and the part \\( AN \\) of the former equator lies between the ecliptic and the new equator \\( AN' \\), while the part \\( AN \\) of the former equator is above the new one \\( AN' \\); therefore the new node \\( N' \\), from which the point \\( A \\) was moving, is removed to the westward, or farther from \\( A \\); and the new node \\( n' \\), to which \\( A \\) is approaching, is also moved westward, or nearer to \\( A \\); and this happens in every position of \\( A \\). The nodes therefore or equinoctial points, continually shift to the westward, or in a contrary direction to the rotation of the earth; and the axis of rotation always deviates to the east side of the meridian which passes through the sun.\n\nThis account of the motions is extremely different from what a person should naturally expect. If the earth were placed in the summer solstice, with respect to us who inhabit its northern hemisphere, and had no rotation round its axis, the equator would begin to approach the ecliptic, and the axis would become more upright; and this would go on with a motion continually accelerating, till the equator coincided with the ecliptic. It would not stop here, but go as far on the other side, till its motion were extinguished by the opposing forces; and it would return to its former position, and again begin to approach the ecliptic, playing up and down like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> of a balance. On this account this motion is very properly termed libration: but this very slow libration, compounded with the incomparably swifter motion of diurnal rotation, produces a third motion extremely different from both. At first the north pole of the earth inclines forward toward the sun; after a long course of years it will incline to the left hand, as viewed from the sun, and be much more inclined to the ecliptic, and the plane of the equator will pass through the sun. The south pole will come into view, and the north pole will begin to decline from the sun; and this will go on (the inclination of the equator diminishing all the while) till, after a course of years, the north pole will be turned quite away from the sun, and the inclination of the equator will be restored to its original quantity. After this the phenomena will have another period similar to the former, but the axis will now deviate to the right hand. And thus, although both the earth and sun should not move from their places, the inhabitants of the earth would have a complete succession of the seasons accomplished in a period of many centuries. This would be prettily illustrated by an iron ring poised very nicely on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a> like the card of\nTheory of a mariner's compass, having its centre of gravity coinciding with the point of the cap, so that it may whirl round in any position. As this is extremely difficult to execute, the cap may be pierced a little deeper, which will cause the ring to maintain a horizontal position with a very small force. When the ring is whirling very steadily, and pretty briskly, in the direction of the hours of a watch-dial, hold a strong magnet above the middle of the nearer semicircle (above the 6 hour point) at the distance of three or four inches. We shall immediately observe the ring rise from the 9 hour point, and sink at the 3 hour point, and gradually acquire a motion of precession and nutation, such as has been described.\n\nIf the earth be now put in motion round the sun, or the sun round the earth, motions of libration and deviation will still obtain, and the succession of their different phases, if we may so call them, will be perfectly analogous to the above statement. But the quantity of deviation, and change of inclination, will now be prodigiously diminished, because the rapid change of the sun's position quickly diminishes the disturbing forces, annihilates them by bringing the sun into the plane of the equator, and brings opposite forces into action.\n\nWe see in general that the deviation of the axis is always at right angles to the plane passing through the sun, and that the axis, instead of being raised from the ecliptic, or brought nearer to it, as the libration would occasion, deviates sidewise; and the equator, instead of being raised or depressed round its east and west points, is twisted sidewise round the north and south points; or at least things have this appearance: but we must now attend to this circumstance more minutely.\n\nTheory of Universal Gravitation.\n\nLet \\( T \\) be \\( 1 \\), in order that \\( n \\) may be \\( 18.6 \\), and substitute for \\( t \\) its value in the fluxion of the nutation, by putting \\( \\sqrt{1-x^2} \\) in place of \\( y \\). By this substitution we obtain \\( m \\pi n \\frac{c}{e b} \\left( \\frac{d b x \\dot{x}}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} - ac x \\dot{x}^2 \\right) \\). The fluent of this is \\( m \\pi n \\frac{c}{e b} \\left( -db \\sqrt{1-x^2} - \\frac{ac x^2}{2} \\right) \\). (Vide Simpson's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUXIONS\">Fluxions</a>, \u00a7 77). But when \\( x \\) is \\( = 0 \\), the nutation must be \\( = 0 \\), because it is from the position in the equinoctial points that all our deviations are reckoned, and it is from this point that the periods of the lunar action recommence. But if we make \\( x = 0 \\) in this expression, the term \\( \\frac{ac x^2}{2} \\) vanishes, and the term \\( -db \\sqrt{1-x^2} \\) becomes \\( -db \\); therefore our fluent has a constant part \\( +db \\); and the complete fluent is \\( m \\pi n \\frac{c}{e b} \\left( db - db \\sqrt{1-x^2} - \\frac{ac x^2}{2} \\right) \\). Now this is equal to \\( m \\pi n \\frac{c}{e b} \\left( db \\times \\text{verfed fine } 2x \\right) \\): For the verfed fine of \\( x \\) is equal to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\cos x \\); and the square of the fine of an arch is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) the verfed fine of twice that arch.\n\nThis, then, is the whole nutation while the moon's ascending node moves from the vernal equinox to the longitude \\( \\varphi N = x \\). It is the expression of a certain number of seconds, because \\( \\pi \\), one of its factors, is the solar precession in seconds; and all the other factors are numbers, or fractions of the radius \\( r \\); even \\( e \\) is expressed in terms of the radius \\( r \\).\n\nThe fluxion of the precession, or the monthly precession, is to that of the nutation as the cotangent of \\( \\varphi E \\) is to the fine of \\( \\varphi \\). This also appears by considering fig. 159. \\( Pp \\) measures the angle \\( A \\), or change of position of the equator; but the precession itself, reckoned on the ecliptic, is measured by \\( Po \\), and the nutation by \\( po \\); and the fluxion of the precession is equal to the fluxion of nutation \\( \\times \\cot \\varphi E \\), but \\( \\cot \\varphi E = \\frac{ad + bc}{cx} \\); therefore \\( \\cot \\varphi E = \\frac{ad + bc \\sqrt{1-x^2}}{cx} \\); This, multiplied into the fluxion of the nutation, gives \\( m \\pi n \\frac{a b d^2}{a b e} \\left( \\frac{b^2 - a^2}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\right) \\dot{x} \\) for the monthly precession. The fluent of this \\( m \\pi n \\frac{a b d^2}{a b e} \\left( \\frac{b^2 - a^2}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\right) \\dot{x} \\), or it is equal to \\( m \\pi n \\frac{a b d^2}{a b e} \\left( \\frac{b^2 - a^2}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\right) \\dot{x} \\), fine \\( 2x \\).\n\nLet us now express this in numbers: When the node has made a half revolution, we have \\( x = 180^\\circ \\), whose verfed fine is \\( 2 \\), and the verfed fine of \\( 2x \\), or \\( 360^\\circ \\), is \\( = 0 \\); therefore, after half a revolution of the node, the nutation becomes \\( m \\pi n \\frac{c}{e b} \\left( b^2 - a^2 \\right) \\). If, in this expression, we supposed \\( m = 2 \\frac{1}{2} \\), and \\( \\pi = 14 \\frac{1}{2} \\), we shall find the nutation to be \\( 19 \\frac{1}{2}'' \\).\n\nNow the observed nutation is about \\( 18'' \\). This requires \\( m \\) to be \\( 2 \\frac{1}{2} \\), and \\( \\pi = 16 \\frac{1}{2}'' \\). But it is evident, that no astronomer can pretend to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANT\">warrant</a> the accuracy of his observations of the nutation within \\( 1'' \\).\n\nThe find the lunar precession during half a revolution of the node, observe, that then \\( z \\) becomes \\( = \\frac{c}{2} \\), and the fine of \\( z \\) and of \\( 2z \\) vanish, \\( d^2 \\) becomes \\( = c^2 \\), and the precession becomes \\( m \\pi n \\frac{a b d^2}{a b e} \\left( \\frac{b^2 - a^2}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\right) \\), and the precession in 18 years is \\( m \\pi n \\frac{a b d^2}{a b e} \\).\n\nWe see, by comparing the nutation and precession for nine years, that they are as \\( \\frac{4c}{e} \\) to \\( 1 - \\frac{1}{2} c^2 \\) nearly as \\( 1 \\) to \\( 17 \\frac{1}{2} \\). This gives \\( 31 \\frac{1}{2}'' \\) of precession, corresponding to \\( 18'' \\), the observed nutation, which is about \\( 35'' \\) of precession annually produced by the moon.\n\nAnd thus we see that the inequality produced by the moon in the precession of the equinoxes, and, more particularly, the nutation occasioned by the variable obliquity of her orbit, enables us to judge of her force in the whole phenomenon; and therefore informs us of her disturbing force, and therefore of her quantity of matter. This phenomenon, and those of the tides, are the only facts which enable us to judge of this matter: and this is one of the circumstances which has caused this problem to occupy so much attention. Dr Bradley, by a nice comparison of his observations with the mathematical theory, as it is called, furnished him by Mr Machin, found that the equation of precession computed by that theory was too great, and that the theory would agree better with the observations, if an ellipse were substituted for Mr Machin's little circle. He thought that the shorter axis of this ellipse, lying in the colure of the solstices, should not exceed \\( 16'' \\). Nothing can more clearly show the astonishing accuracy of Bradley's observations than this remark: for it results from the theory, that the pole must really describe an ellipse, having its shorter axis in the solstitial colure, and the ratio of the axes must be that of \\( 18 \\) to \\( 16 \\); for the mean precession during a half revolution of the node is \\( m \\pi n \\frac{a b d^2}{a b e} \\left( \\frac{b^2 - a^2}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\right) \\); and therefore for the longitude \\( z \\), it will be \\( m \\pi n \\frac{a b d^2}{a b e} \\left( \\frac{b^2 - a^2}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\right) \\); when this is taken from the true precession for that longitude, it leaves the equation of precession \\( m \\pi n \\frac{a b d^2}{a b e} \\left( \\frac{b^2 - a^2}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\right) \\); therefore when the node is in the solstice, and the equation greatest, we have it \\( m \\pi n c \\left( b^2 - a^2 \\right) \\). We here neglect the second term as insignificant.\nThis greatest equation of precession is to \\( \\frac{2m\\pi nc}{c} \\), the nutation of \\( 18'' \\), as \\( b^2 - a^2 \\) to \\( 2ab \\); that is, as radius to the tangent of twice the obliquity of the ecliptic. This gives the greatest equation of precession \\( 16'' \\), not differing half a second from Bradley's observations.\n\nThus have we attempted to give some account of this curious and important phenomenon. It is curious, because it affects the whole celestial motions in a very intricate manner, and received no explanation from the more obvious application of mechanical principles, which so happily accounted for all the other appearances. It is one of the most illustrious proofs of Sir Isaac Newton's sagacity and penetration, which catches at a very remote analogy between this phenomenon and the libration of the moon's orbit. It is highly important to the progress of practical and useful astronomy, because it has enabled us to compute tables of such accuracy, that they can be used with confidence for determining the longitude of a ship at sea. This alone fixes its importance; but it is still more important to the philosopher, affording the most incontrovertible proof of the universal and mutual gravitation of all matter to all matter. It left nothing in the solar system unexplained from the theory of gravity but the acceleration of the moon's mean motion; and this has at last been added to the list of our acquisitions by M. de la Place.\n\n\\[ \\text{Que toties animos veterum torfore Sophorum,} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Quaque scholas fruifra vaux certamine vexant,} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Ovora conspicimus, nube pellente Mathefi,} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Jam dubios nulla caligine praegravat error} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Quis superum penetrare domos, atque ardua cali} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Scandere sublimis genit concepsit acumen.} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Nec fas est proprius mortali attingere divos.} \\]\n\nHalley.\n\nSect. X. Of the Libration of the Moon.\n\nThe only phenomena which still remain to be explained are the libration of the moon and the motion of the nodes of her equator. The moon in consequence of her rotation round her axis is a little flattened towards the poles; but the attraction of the earth must have lengthened the axis of the moon directed towards that planet. If the moon were homogeneous and fluid, she would assume the form of an ellipsoid, whose shorter axis would pass through her poles of rotation; the longer axis would be directed towards the earth, and in the plane of the moon's equator; and the mean axis, situated in the same plane, would be perpendicular to the two others. The excess of the longer over the shorter would be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPLE\">quadruple</a> the excess of the mean axis over the shorter, and would amount to about \\( \\frac{1}{29711} \\), the shorter axis being represented by unity.\n\nIt is easy to see, that if the longer axis of the moon deviate a little from the direction of the radius vector, which joins together the centres of the earth and moon, the attraction of the earth will tend to bring it towards that radius just as gravity tends to bring a pendulum towards the vertical position. If the rotation of the satellite had been at first sufficiently rapid to overcome this tendency, the time of a rotation would not have been equal to that of a revolution round the earth, and their difference would have disappeared to us successively all the points of the moon's surface. But the angular motions of rotation and revolution having been at first but very little different, the force with which the longer axis separated from the radius vector was not sufficient to overcome the tendency toward the radius vector occasioned by the attraction of the earth. This last tendency, therefore, has rendered the two motions rigidly equal. And, as a pendulum driven from the vertical direction by a very small force constantly returns to it, making small oscillations on each side, in like manner the longer axis of the moon ought to oscillate on each side of the radius vector of her orbit. The libration of the moon then depends upon the small difference which originally subsisted between the angular motions of the moon's rotation and revolution.\n\nThus we see, that the theory of gravitation explains the equality which subsists between the mean rotation and revolution of the moon. It is only necessary to suppose, that the original difference between them was small. In that case the attraction of the earth would soon reduce them to a state of equality.\n\nThe singular coincidence of the nodes of the moon's equator, with those of its orbit, is also owing to the attraction of the earth. This was first demonstrated by La Grange. The planes of the equator and of the orbit of the moon, and the plane which passes through its centre, parallel to the ecliptic, have always nearly the same inclination. The secular movements of the ecliptic neither alter the coincidence of the nodes of these three planes, nor their mean inclination, which the attraction of the earth keeps always the same.\n\nWe have now examined all the phenomena of the heavenly bodies, and have found that they are all explicable on the theory of gravitation, and indeed necessary consequences of that theory. The exact coincidence of all the phenomena must be considered as a complete demonstration of the truth of the theory; and indeed places it beyond the reach of every possible objection. With respect to the nature of this force called gravitation, nothing whatever is known, nor is it likely that any thing ever will be known. The discussion being evidently above the reach of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> faculties, all the different theories which have been published, explaining it by ethers, &c., have only served to show the weakness of human reason, when it attempts to leave the plain path of experience, and indulge in fancy and conjecture.\nIn the preceding article we have endeavoured to give as full a view as possible of astronomy; avoiding, at the same time, the introduction of minute details upon those subjects which are not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a>, that the reader's attention might not be distracted and diverted from objects of primary importance. But for the sake of those persons who may wish to indulge their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for practical astronomy, we have thought proper to subjoin an appendix; in which we shall give, in the first place, the rules for calculating eclipses, and in the second, a description of the most important astronomical instruments.\n\nI. Method of calculating Eclipses.\n\nThe method of constructing tables for the calculation of eclipses will be understood from the following observations.\n\nThe motions of the sun and moon are observed to be continually accelerated from the apogee to the perigee, and as gradually retarded from the perigee to the apogee; being swiftest of all when the mean anomaly is nothing, and slowest of all when it is six signs.\n\nWhen the luminary is in its apogee or perigee, its place is the same as it would be if its motion were equable in all parts of its orbit. The supposed equable motions are called mean; the unequal are justly called the true.\n\nThe mean place of the sun or moon is always forwarder than the true place, whilst the luminary is moving from its apogee to its perigee; and the true place is always forwarder than the mean, whilst the luminary is moving from its perigee to its apogee. In the former case, the anomaly is always less than six signs; and in the latter case, more.\n\nIt has been found, by a long series of observations, that the sun goes through the ecliptic, from the vernal equinox to the same equinox again, in 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 55 seconds; from the first star of Aries to the same star again, in 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes 24 seconds; and from his apogee to the same again, in 365 days 6 hours 14 minutes 0 seconds.\n\nThe first of these is called the solar year; the second the sidereal year; and the third the anomalistic year. So that the solar year is 20 minutes 29 seconds shorter than the sidereal; and the sidereal year is four minutes 36 seconds shorter than the anomalistic. Hence it appears, that the equinoctial point, or intersection of the ecliptic and equator at the beginning of Aries, goes backward with respect to the fixed stars, and that the sun's apogee goes forward.\n\nIt is also observed, that the moon goes through her orbit, from any given fixed star to the same star again, in 27 days 7 hours 43 minutes 4 seconds at a mean rate; from her apogee to her apogee again, in 27 days 13 hours 18 minutes 43 seconds; and from the sun to the moon again, in 29 days 12 hours 44 minutes 37 seconds. This shows that the moon's apogee moves forward in the ecliptic, and that at a much quicker rate than the sun's apogee does: since the moon is 5 hours 55 minutes 39 seconds longer in revolving from her apogee to her apogee again, than from any star to the same star again.\n\nThe moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic in two opposite points, which are called her nodes: and it is observed, that she revolves sooner from any node to the node again, than from any star to the star again, by 2 hours 38 minutes 27 seconds; which shows that her nodes move backward, or contrary to the order of signs in the ecliptic.\n\nThe time in which the moon revolves from the sun to the sun again (or from change to change) is called a lunation; which, according to Dr. Pound's mean measures, would always consist of 29 days 12 hours 44 minutes 3 seconds 2 thirds 58 fourths, if the motions of the sun and moon were always equable. Hence 12 mean lunations contain 354 days 8 hours 48 minutes 36 seconds 35 thirds 40 fourths, which is 10 days 21 hours 11 minutes 23 seconds 24 thirds 20 fourths less than the length of a common Julian year, consisting of 365 days 6 hours; and 13 mean lunations contain 383 days 21 hours 32 minutes 59 seconds 38 thirds 38 fourths, which exceeds the length of a common Julian year, by 18 days 15 hours 32 minutes 39 seconds 38 thirds 38 fourths.\n\nThe mean time of new moon being found for any given year and month, as suppose for March 1700 old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, if this mean new moon falls later than the 11th day of March, then 12 mean lunations added to the time of this mean new moon will give the time of the mean new moon in March 1701, after having thrown off 365 days. But when the mean new moon happens to be before the 11th of March, we must add 13 mean lunations, in order to have the time of mean new moon in March the year following; always taking care to subtract 365 days in common years, and 366 days in leap years, from the sum of this addition.\n\nThus, A.D. 1700, old style, the time of mean new moon in March was the 8th day, at 16 hours 11 minutes 25 seconds after the noon of that day (viz. at 11 minutes 25 seconds past four in the morning of the 9th day), according to common reckoning. To this we must add 13 mean lunations, or 383 days 21 hours 32 minutes 39 seconds 38 thirds 38 fourths, and the sum will be 392 days 13 hours 44 minutes 4 seconds 38 thirds 38 fourths: from which subtract 365 days, because the year 1701 is a common year, and there will remain 27 days 13 hours 44 minutes 4 seconds 38 thirds 38 fourths for the time of mean new moon in March, A.D. 1701.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">Carrying</a> on this addition and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUBTRACTION\">subtraction</a> till A.D. 1703, we find the time of mean new moon in March that year to be on the 6th day, at 7 hours 21 minutes 17 seconds 49 thirds 46 fourths past noon; to which add 13 mean lunations, and the sum will be 390 days 4 hours 53 minutes 57 seconds 28 thirds 20 fourths; from which subtract 366 days, because the year 1704 is a leap-year, and there will remain 24 days 4 hours 53 minutes 57 seconds 28 thirds 20 fourths, for the time of mean new moon in March A.D. 1704.\n\nIn this manner was the first of the following tables constructed to seconds, thirds, and fourths; and then wrote out to the nearest seconds. The reason why we chose to begin the year with March, was to avoid the inconvenience of adding a day to the tabular time in leap-years after February, or subtracting a day therefrom.\nOf Calculating Eclipses, &c.\n\nThe mean anomalies of the sun and moon, and the sun's mean motion from the ascending node of the moon's orbit, are set down in Table III., from 1 to 13 mean lunations. These numbers, for 13 lunations, being added to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADICAL\">radical</a> anomalies of the sun and moon, and to the sun's mean distance from the ascending node, at the time of mean new moon in March 1700 (Table I.), will give their mean anomalies, and the sun's mean distance from the node, at the time of mean new moon in March 1701, and being added for 12 lunations to those for 1701, give them for the time of mean new moon in March 1702. And so on as far as you please to continue the table (which is here carried on to the year 1800), always throwing off 12 signs when their sum exceeds 12, and setting down the remainder as the proper quantity.\n\nIf the number belonging to A.D. 1700 (in Table I.) be subtracted from those belonging to 1800, we shall have their whole differences in 100 complete Julian years; which accordingly we find to be 4 days 8 hours 10 minutes 52 seconds 15 thirds 40 fourths, with respect to the time of mean new moon. These being added together 60 times (always taking care to throw off a whole lunation when the days exceed 29\u00bd) make up 60 centuries, or 6000 years, as in Table VI., which was carried on to seconds, thirds, and fourths; and then wrote out to the nearest seconds. In the same manner were the respective anomalies and the sun's distance from the node found, for these centurial years; and then (for want of room) wrote out only to the nearest minutes, which is sufficient in whole centuries. By means of these two tables, we may find the time of any mean new moon in March, together with the anomalies of the sun and moon, and the sun's distance from the node at these times, within the limits of 6000 years either before or after any given year in the 18th century; and the mean time of any new or full moon in any given month after March, by means of the third and fourth tables, within the same limits, as shown in the precepts for calculation.\n\nThus it would be a very easy matter to calculate the time of any new or full moon, if the sun and moon moved equably in all parts of their orbits. But we have already shown, that their places are never the same as they would be by equable motions, except when they are in apogee or perigee; which is, when their mean anomalies are either nothing or six signs; and that their mean places are always fartherward than their true places, whilst the anomaly is less than six signs; and their two places are fartherward than the mean, whilst the anomaly is more.\n\nHence it is evident, that whilst the sun's anomaly is less than six signs, the moon will overtake him, or be opposite to him, sooner than she could if his motion were equable; and later whilst his anomaly is more than six signs. The greatest difference that can possibly happen between the mean and true time of new or full moon, on account of the inequality of the sun's motion, is 3 hours 48 minutes 28 seconds: and that is, when the sun's anomaly is either 3 signs 1 degree, or 8 signs 29 degrees; sooner in the first case, and later in the last.\u2014In all other signs and degrees of anomaly, the difference is gradually less, and vanishes when the anomaly is either nothing or six signs.\n\nThe fun is in his apogee on the 30th of June, and in his perigee on the 30th of December, in the present age: so that he is nearer the earth in winter than in our summer.\u2014The proportional difference of distance, deduced from the difference of the sun's apparent diameter at these times, is as 683 to 1017.\n\nThe moon's orbit is dilated in winter, and contracted in summer; therefore the lunations are longer in winter than in summer. The greatest difference is found to be 22 minutes 29 seconds; the lunations increasing gradually in length whilst the sun is moving from his apogee to his perigee, and decreasing in length whilst he is moving from his perigee to his apogee.\u2014On this account, the moon will be later every time in coming to her conjunction with the sun, or being in opposition to him, from December till June, and sooner from June till December, than if her orbit had continued of the same size all the year round.\n\nAs both these differences depend on the sun's anomaly, they may be fitly put together into one table, and called The annual or first equation of the mean to the true syzygy, (See Table VII.) This equational difference is to be subtracted from the time of the mean syzygy when the sun's anomaly is less than six signs, and added when the anomaly is more.\u2014At the greatest it is 4 hours 10 minutes 57 seconds, viz., 3 hours 48 minutes 28 seconds, on account of the sun's unequal motion, and 22 minutes 29 seconds, on account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a> of the moon's orbit.\n\nThis compound equation would be sufficient for reducing the mean time of new or full moon to the true time thereof, if the moon's orbit were of a circular form, and her motion quite equable in it. But the moon's orbit is more elliptical than the sun's, and her motion in it is so much the more unequal. The difference is so great, that she is sometimes in conjunction with the sun, or in opposition to him, sooner by 9 hours 47 minutes 54 seconds, than she would be if her motion were equable; and at other times as much later. The former happens when her mean anomaly is 9 signs 4 degrees, and the latter when it is 2 signs 26 degrees. See Table IX.\n\nAt different distances of the sun from the moon's apogee, the figure of the moon's orbit becomes different. It is longest of all, or most eccentric, when the sun is in the same sign and degree either with the moon's apogee or perigee; shortest of all, or least eccentric, when the sun's distance from the moon's apogee is either three signs or nine signs; and at a mean state when the distance is either 1 sign 15 degrees, 4 signs 15 degrees, 7 signs 15 degrees, or 10 signs 15 degrees. When the moon's orbit is at its greatest eccentricity, her apogee distance from the earth's centre is to her perigeeal distance therefrom, as 1067 is to 933; when least eccentric, as 1043 is to 957; and when at the mean state, as 1055 is to 945.\n\nBut the sun's distance from the moon's apogee is equal to the quantity of the moon's mean anomaly at the time of new moon, and by the addition of 6 signs it becomes equal in quantity to the moon's mean anomaly at the time of full moon. Therefore, a table may be constructed so as to answer to all the various inequalities depending on the different eccentricities of the moon's orbit, in the syzygies, and called The se-\nAppendix.\n\nOf Calculating the Equation of the Mean to the True Syzygy. (See Table IX.)\n\nAnd the moon's anomaly, when equated by Table VIII., may be made the proper argument for taking out this second equation of time; which must be added to the former equated time, when the moon's anomaly is less than five signs, and subtracted when the anomaly is more.\n\nThere are several other inequalities in the moon's motion, which sometimes bring on the true syzygy a little sooner, and at other times keep it back a little later, than it would otherwise be; but they are so small, that they may be all omitted except two; the former of which (see Table X.) depends on the difference between the anomalies of the sun and moon in the syzygies, and the latter (see Table XI.) depends on the sun's distance from the moon's nodes at these times. The greatest difference arising from the former is 4 minutes 58 seconds; and from the latter, 1 minute 34 seconds.\n\nThe tables here inserted being calculated by Mr. Ferguson according to the methods already given, he gives the following directions for their use.\n\nTo calculate the true Time of New or Full Moon.\n\nPrecept I. If the required time be within the limits of the 18th century, write out the mean time of new moon in March, for the proposed year, from Table I. in the old style, or from Table II. in the new; together with the mean anomalies of the sun and moon, and the sun's mean distance from the moon's ascending node. If you want the time of full moon in March, and the half lunation at the foot of Table III. with its anomalies, &c. to the former numbers, if the new moon falls before the 15th of March; but if it falls after, subtract the half lunation, with the anomalies, &c. belonging to it, from the former numbers, and write down the respective sums or remainders.\n\nII. In these additions or subtractions, observe, that 60 seconds make a minute, 60 minutes make a degree, 30 degrees make a sign, and 12 signs make a circle. When you exceed 12 signs in addition, reject 12, and set down the remainder. When the number of signs to be subtracted is greater than the number you subtract from, add 12 signs to the lesser number, and then you will have a remainder to set down. In the tables signs are marked thus *, degrees thus \u00b0, minutes thus \u2032, and seconds thus \u2033.\n\nIII. When the required new or full moon is in any given month after March, write out as many lunations with their anomalies, and the sun's distance from the node from Table III. as the given month is after March, setting them in order below the number taken out for March.\n\nIV. Add all these together, and they will give the mean time of the required new or full moon, with the mean anomalies and sun's mean distance from the ascending node, which are the arguments for finding the proper equations.\n\nV. With the number of days added together, enter Table IV. under the given month; and against that number you have the day of mean new or full moon in the left-hand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a>, which set before the hours, minutes, and seconds, already found.\n\nBut (as it will sometimes happen) if the said number of days fall short of any in the column under the given month, add one lunation and its anomalies, &c. (from Table III.) to the foresaid sums, and then you will have a new sum of days wherewith to enter Table IV. under the given month, where you are sure to find it the second time, if the first falls short.\n\nVI. With the signs and degrees of the sun's anomaly, enter Table VII. and therewith take out the annual or first equation for reducing the mean syzygy to the true; taking care to make proportions in the table for the odd minutes and seconds of anomaly, as the table gives the equation only to whole degrees.\n\nObserve, in this and every other case of finding equations, that if the signs are at the head of the table, their degrees are at the left hand, and are reckoned downwards; but if the signs are at the foot of the table, their degrees are at the right hand, and are counted upward; the equation being in the body of the table, under or over the signs, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLATERAL\">collateral</a> line with the degrees. The titles Add or Subtract at the head or foot of the tables where the signs are found, show whether the equation is to be added to the mean time of new or full moon, or to be subtracted from it. In this table, the equation is to be subtracted, if the signs of the sun's anomaly are found at the head of the table; but it is to be added, if the signs are at the foot.\n\nVII. With the signs and degrees of the sun's mean anomaly, enter Table VIII. and take out the equation of the moon's mean anomaly; subtract this equation from her mean anomaly, if the signs of the sun's anomaly be at the head of the table, but add it if they are at the foot; the result will be the moon's equated anomaly, with which enter Table IX. and take out the second equation for reducing the mean to the true time of new or full moon; adding this equation, if the signs of the moon's anomaly are at the head of the table, but subtracting it if they are at the foot; and the result will give you the mean time of the required new or full moon twice equated, which will be sufficiently near for common almanacs.\u2014But when you want to calculate an eclipse, the following equations must be used; thus,\n\nVIII. Subtract the moon's equated anomaly from the sun's mean anomaly, and with the remainder in signs and degrees enter Table X. and take out the third equation, applying it to the former equated time, as the titles Add or Subtract do direct.\n\nIX. With the sun's mean distance from the ascending node enter Table XI. and take out the equation answering to that argument, adding it to, or subtracting it from, the former equated time, as the titles direct, and the result will give the time of new or full moon, agreeing with well regulated clocks or watches very near the truth. But to make it agree with the solar, or apparent time, you must apply the equation of natural days, taken from an equation-table, as it is leap-year, or the first, second, or third after. This, however, unless in very nice calculations, needs not be regarded, as the difference between true and apparent time is never very considerable.\n\nThe method of calculating the time of any new or full moon without the limits of the 18th century will be shown further on. And a few examples compared with the precepts will make the whole work plain.\n\nN.B. The tables begin the day at noon, and reckon forward from thence to the noon following.\u2014Thus, March the 31st, at 22 h. 30 m. 25 sec. of tabular time is April 1st (in common reckoning) at 30 m. 25 sec. after 10 o'clock in the morning.","sp":37,"ep":159},{"h":"ASTRONOMY","t":"Of Calculating the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOON\">Moon</a> in any given year and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> after the 18th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>.\n\nPrecept I.

Then take the moon's semidiameter, 14\u00b0 57', in your compasses from the same scale, and setting one foot in the path of the penumbra's centre at \\( m \\), in the 47\u00b0 1/2 minutes after ten, with the other foot describe the circle \\( TY \\) for the moon's disk, as seen from London, at the time when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECLIPSE\">eclipse</a> is at the greatest, and the portion of the sun's disk which is hid or cut off by the moon's will show the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of the eclipse at that time; which quantity may be measured on a line equal to the sun's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, and divided into 12 equal parts for digits.\n\nLastly, take the semidiameter of the penumbra, 31\u00b0 3', from the scale CA in your compasses; and setting one foot in the line of the penumbra's centre path, on the left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> from the axis of the ecliptic, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the other foot toward the path of London; and carry that extent backwards and forwards till both the points of the compasses fall into the same instants in both the paths: and these instants will denote the time when the eclipse begins at London. \u2014Then do the like on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> hand of the axis of the ecliptic; and where the points of the compasses fall into the same instants in both the paths, they will show at what time the eclipse ends at London.\n\nThese trials give 20 minutes after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> in the morning for the beginning of the eclipse at London, at the points N and O; 47\u00b0 1/2 minutes after ten, at the points \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), for the time of greatest obscuration; and 18 minutes after twelve, at R and S, for the time when the eclipse ends; according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> or equal time.\n\nFrom these times we must subtract the equation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> days, viz. 3 minutes 48 seconds, in leap year <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 1, and we shall have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> times; namely, 9 hours 16 minutes 12 seconds for the beginning of the eclipse, 10 hours 43 minutes 42 seconds for the time of greatest obscuration, and 12 hours 14 minutes 12 seconds for the time when the eclipse ends. But the best way is to apply this equation to the true equal time of new moon, before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a> be begun; as is done in Example I. For the motion or position of places on the earth's disk answer to apparent or solar time.\n\nIn this construction it is supposed, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> under which the moon's disk is seen, during the whole time of the eclipse, continues invariably the same; and that the moon's motion is uniform and rectilineal during that time. But these suppositions do not exactly agree with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>; and therefore, supposing the elements given by the tables to be accurate, yet the times and phases of the eclipse, deduced from its construction will not answer exactly to what passeth in the heavens; but may be at least two or three minutes wrong, though done with the greatest care. Moreover, the paths of all places of considerable latitudes are nearer the centre of the earth's disk as seen from the sun than those constructions make them; because the disk is projected as if the earth were a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a>, although it is known to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHEROID\">spheroid</a>. Consequently, the moon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> will go farther northward in all places of northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>, and farther southward in all places of southern latitude, than it is shown to do in these projections. \u2014According to Meyer's Tables, this eclipse was about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an hour sooner than either these tables, or Mr Flamsteed's, or Dr Halley's, make it; and was not annular at London. But M. de la Caille's make it almost central.\n\nThe projection of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> eclipses.\n\nWhen the moon is within 12 degrees of either of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NODES\">nodes</a> at the time when she is full, she will be eclipsed, otherwise not.\n\nWe find by Example II. that at the time of mean full moon in May 1762, the sun's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from the ascending node was only 4\u00b0 49' 35\"; and the moon being then opposite to the sun, must have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as near her descending node, and was therefore eclipsed.\n\nThe elements for constructing an eclipse of the moon are eight in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, as follows:\n\n1. The true time of full moon; and at that time;\n2. The moon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLAX\">parallax</a>.\n3. The sun's semidiameter.\n4. The moon's.\n5. The semidiameter of the earth's shadow at the moon.\n6. The moon's latitude.\n7. The angle of the moon's visible path with the ecliptic.\n8. The moon's true horary motion from the sun. \u2014Therefore,\n\n1. To find the true time of new or full moon. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">Work</a> as already taught in the precepts. \u2014Thus we have the true time of full moon in May 1762 (see Example II. page 562) on the 8th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, at 50 minutes 50 seconds past three o'clock in the morning.\n\n2. To find the moon's horizontal parallax. Enter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABLE\">Table</a> XVII. with the moon's mean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANOMALY\">anomaly</a> (at the above full) 6\u00b0 20' 42\" 42\", and thereby take out her horizontal parallax; which, by making the requisite proportions, will be found to be 57' 23\".\n\n3. To find the semidiameters of the sun and moon. Enter Table XVII. with their respective anomalies, the sun's being 1\u00b0 5\u00b0 27' 4\" (by the above example) and the moon's 2\u00b0 42' 42\"; and thereby take out their respective semidiameters; the sun's 15\u00b0 56\", and the moon's 15\u00b0 38\".\n5. To find the semidiameter of the earth's shadow at the moon. Add the sun's horizontal parallax, which is always 1\u00b0 23', to the moon's which in the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is 57\u00b0 33', from which subtract the sun's semidiameter 1\u00b0 56', and there will remain 41\u00b0 37\" for the semidiameter of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the earth's shadow which the moon then passes through.\n\n6. To find the moon's latitude. Find the sun's true distance from the ascending node (as already taught at the true time of full moon; and this distance increased by five signs will be the moon's true distance from the same node; and consequently the argument for finding her true latitude.\n\nThus, in Example II., the sun's mean distance from the ascending node was of 40\u00b0 49' 35\", at the time of mean full moon; but it appears by the example, that the true time thereof was six hours 33 minutes 38 seconds sooner than the mean time; and therefore we must subtract the sun's motion from the node (found in Table XII.) during this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> from the above mean distance of 4\u00b0 49' 35\", in order to have his mean distance from it at the true time of full moon. Then to this apply the equation of his mean distance from the node, found in Table XV., by his mean anomaly 1\u00b0 7' 27\" 45\"; and lastly add five signs: so shall the moon's true distance from the ascending node be found as follows:\n\n| Sun from node at mean full moon | 0\u00b0 4\u00b0 49' 35\" |\n|-------------------------------|---------------|\n| His motion from it in          |               |\n| 6 hours                        | 1\u00b0 56'        |\n| 33 minutes                     | 1\u00b0 23'        |\n| 38 seconds                     |               |\n| Sum, subtract from the uppermost line | 2\u00b0 1\u00b0 37\" |\n| Remains his mean distance at true full moon | 0\u00b0 4\u00b0 33' 32\" |\n| Equation of his mean distance, add | 1\u00b0 30' 0\" |\n| Sun's true distance from the node | 0\u00b0 10' 32\" |\n| To which add                   |               |\n| And the sum will be            | 0\u00b0 6\u00b0 10' 32\" |\n\nWhich is the moon's true distance from her ascending node at the true time of her being full; and consequently the argument for finding her true latitude at that time.\n\nTherefore, with this argument enter Table XVI., making proportions between the latitudes belonging to the 6th and 7th degree of the argument at the left hand (the signs being at top) for the 1\u00b0 32\", and it will give 32\u00b0 21\" for the moon's true latitude, which appears by the table to be south descending.\n\n7. To find the angle of the moon's visible path with the ecliptic. This may be stated at 5\u00b0 35'; without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> in the projection of the eclipse.\n\n8. To find the moon's true horary motion from the sun. With their respective anomalies take out their horary motions from Table XVII., and the sun's horary motion subtracted from the moon's, leaves remaining the moon's true horary motion from the sun: in the present case 30\u00b0 32\".\n\nNow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> these elements together for use.\n\n1. True time of full moon in May, 1762\n\n| D.H.M.S. |\n|----------|\n| 8\u00b0 5\u00b0 50' 50\" |\n\n2. Moon's horizontal parallax\n\n| 0\u00b0 57' 23\" |\n\n3.

Then F shall be the point in the earth's shadow, where the moon's centre is at the middle of the eclipse; G, the point where her centre is at the tabular time of her being full; and H, the point where her centre is at the instant of her ecliptical opposition.\n\nTake the moon's horary motion from the sun, 30\u00b0 52', in your compasses from the scale; and with that extent make marks along the line of the moon's path PCN: then divide each space from mark to mark into 60 equal parts, or horary minutes, and set the hours to the proper dots in such a manner, that the dot signifying the instant of full moon (viz. 50 minutes 50 seconds after III in the morning) may be in the point G, where the line of the moon's path cuts the line that bisects the angle DCE.\n\nTake the moon's semidiameter, 1\u00b0 38\", in your compasses from the scale, and with that extent, as a radius, upon the points N, F, and P, as centres, describe the circle Q for the moon at the beginning of the eclipse, when she touches the earth's shadow at V; the circle R for the moon at the middle of the eclipse; and the circle S for the moon at the end of the eclipse, just leaving the earth's shadow at W.\n\nThe point N denotes the instant when the eclipse began, namely, at 15 minutes 10 seconds after II in the morning; the point F the middle of the eclipse at 47 minutes 44 seconds past III; and the point P the end of the eclipse, at 18 minutes after V.\u2014At the greatest obscuration the moon was 10 digits eclipsed.\n\nTABLE I.\n### Table I\n\nThe mean time of New Moon in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">Style</a>; with the mean Anomalies of the Sun and Moon, and the Sun\u2019s mean distance from the Moon\u2019s ascending Node, from A.D. 1700 to A.D. 1800 inclusive.\n\n| A.D. | Mean New Moon in March | Sun\u2019s Mean Anomaly | Moon\u2019s mean Anomaly | Moon\u2019s mean Diff. from the Node |\n|------|-----------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|\n|      | D.

The frame of it, which contains the wheel-work, &c. and regulates the whole machine, is made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EBONY\">ebony</a>, and about four feet in diameter; the outside thereof is adorned with 12 pilasters. Between these the 12 signs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZODIAC\">zodiac</a> are neatly painted with gilded frames. Above the frame is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a> supported with 12 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILLARS\">pillars</a>. This ring represents the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> of the ecliptic; upon which are two circles of degrees, and between these the names and characters of the 12 signs. Near the outside is a circle of months and days, exactly corresponding to the sun's place at noon each day throughout the year. Above the ecliptic stand some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> circles of the sphere, agreeable to their respective situations in the heavens: viz. No. 10. are the two colures, divided into degrees and half degrees; No. 11. is one-half the equinoctial circle, making an angle of $23\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees. The tropic of Cancer and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCTIC\">arctic</a> circle are each fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> at their proper distance from the equinoctial. On the northern half of the ecliptic is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> semicircle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> upon two points fixed in $\\varphi$ and $\\omega$. This semicircle serves as a moveable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a> to be put to any degree of latitude upon the north part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MERIDIAN\">meridian</a>, and the whole machine may be set to any latitude without disturbing any of the internal motions, by two strong hinges (No. 13.) fixed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>-frame upon which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> moves, and a strong brass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a>, having holes at every degree, through which a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> is put at every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a>. This arch and the two hinges support the whole machine when it is lifted up according to any latitude; and the arch at other times lies conveniently under the bottom-frame. When the machine is to be set to any latitude (which is easily done by two men, each taking hold of two handles conveniently fixed for the purpose), set the moveable horizon to the same degree upon the meridian, and hence you may form an idea of the respective <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> or depression of the planets both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> and secondary. The sun (No. 1.) stands in the middle of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> upon a wire, making an angle with the ecliptic of about 82 degrees. Next the sun is small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> (2.), representing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a>. Next to Mercury is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENUS\">Venus</a> (3.), represented by a larger ball. The earth is represented (No. 4.) by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-IVORY\">ivory</a> ball, having some circles and a map sketched upon it. The wire which supports the earth makes an angle with the ecliptic of $66\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees, the inclination of the earth's axis to the ecliptic. Near the bottom of the earth's axis is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DIAL\">dial</a>-plate (No. 9.), having an index <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> to the hours of the day as the earth turns round its axis. Round the earth is a ring supported by two small pillars, representing the orbit of the moon; and the divisions upon it answer to the moon's latitude. The motion of this ring represents the motion of the moon's orbit according to that of the nodes. Within this ring is the moon (No. 5.), having a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a> or case, by which its motion represents the phases of the moon according to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. Without the orbits of the earth and moon is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a> (No. 6.) The next in order to Mars is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> and his four moons (No. 7.) Each of these moons is supported by a wire fixed in a socket which turns about the pillar supporting Jupiter. These satellites may be turned by the hand to any position, and yet when the machine is put into motion, they will all move in their proper times. The outermost of all is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a>, his five moons, and his ring (No. 8.) These moons are supported and contrived similar to those of Jupiter. The machine is put into motion by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> a small winch (No. 14.) and by pulling out and pushing in a small cylindrical pin above the handle. When it is pushed in, all the planets, both primary and secondary, will move according to their respective periods by turning the handle. When it is drawn out, the motions of the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn will be stopped while all the rest move without interruption. There is also a brass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>, having two convex glasses to be put in room of the sun; and also a smaller earth and moon, made somewhat in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to their distance from each other, which may be put on at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. The lamp turns round at the same time with the earth, and the glasses of it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> upon her; and when the smaller earth and moon are placed on, it will be easy to show when either of them will be eclipsed. When this machine is intended to be used, the planets must be duly placed by means of an ephemeris hereafter described; and you may place a small black patch or bit of wax upon the middle of the sun. Right against the first degree of $\\varphi$, you may also place patches upon Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, right against some noted point in the ecliptic. Put in the handle, and push in the pin which is above it. One turn of this handle answers to a revolution of the ball which represents the earth about its axis; and consequently to 24 hours of time, as shown by the hour index (9.), which is marked and placed at the foot of the wire on which the ball of the earth is fixed. Again, when the index has moved the space of ten hours, Jupiter makes one revolution round its axis, and so of the rest. By these means the revolutions of the planets, and their motions round their own axes, will be represented to the eye. By observing the motions of the spots upon the surface of the sun and of the planets in the heavens, their diurnal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> was first discovered, after the same manner as we in this machine observe the motions of their representatives by that of the marks placed upon them.\n\nThe Orrery (fig. 162.) is a machine contrived by the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> Mr James Ferguson. It shows the motions of the sun, Mercury, Venus, earth, and moon; and occasionally the superior planets, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, may be put on. Jupiter's four satellites are moved round him in their proper times by a small winch; and Saturn has his five satellites, and his ring which keeps its parallelism round the sun; and by a lamp put in the sun's place, the ring shows all its various phases already described.\n\nIn the centre, No. 1. represents the sun, supported by its axis, inclining almost 8 degrees from the axis of the ecliptic, and turning round in $25\\frac{1}{2}$ days on its axis, of which the north pole inclines toward the eighth degree of Pices in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> ecliptic (No. 11.), whereon the months and days are engraven over the signs and degrees in which the sun appears, as seen from the earth, on the different days of the year.\nThe nearest planet (No. 2.) to the sun is Mercury, which goes round him in 87 days, 23 hours, or $87\\frac{1}{2}$ diurnal rotations of the earth; but has no motion round its axis in the machine, because the time of its diurnal motion in the heavens is not known to us.\n\nThe next planet in order is Venus (No. 3.), which performs her annual course in 224 days 17 hours, and turns round her axis in 24 days 8 hours, or in $24\\frac{1}{2}$ diurnal rotations of the earth. Her axis inclines $75^\\circ$ degrees from the axis of the ecliptic, and her north pole inclines towards the 20th degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AQUARIUS\">Aquarius</a>, according to the observations of Bianchini. She shows all the phenomena described in Part II.\n\nNext, without the orbit of Venus, is the earth (No. 4.), which turns round its axis, to any fixed point at a great distance, in 23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds of mean solar time; but from the sun to the sun again, in 24 hours of the same time. No. 6. is a fidereal dial-plate under the earth, and No. 7., a solar dial-plate on the cover of the machine. The index of the former shows fidereal, and of the latter, solar time; and hence the former index gains one entire revolution on the latter every year, as 365 solar or natural days contain 366 fidereal days, or apparent revolutions of the stars.\n\nIn the time that the earth makes $365\\frac{1}{4}$ diurnal rotations on its axis, it goes once round the sun in the plane of the ecliptic; and always keeps opposite to a moving index (No. 10.) which shows the sun's daily change of place, and also the days of the months.\n\nThe earth is half covered with a black cap, for dividing the apparently enlightened half next the sun from the other half, which, when turned away from him, is in the dark. The edge of the cap represents the circle bounding light and darkness, and shows at what time the sun rises and sets to all places throughout the year. The earth's axis inclines $23\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees from the axis of the ecliptic; the north pole inclines towards the beginning of Cancer, and keeps its parallelism throughout its annual course; so that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> the northern parts of the earth incline towards the sun, and in winter from him; by which means, the different lengths of days and nights, and the cause of the various seasons, are demonstrated to sight.\n\nThere is a broad horizon, to the upper side of which is fixed a meridian semicircle in the north and south points, graduated on both sides from the horizon to $90^\\circ$ in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZENITH\">zenith</a> or vertical point. The edge of the horizon is graduated from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> and west to the south and north points, and within these divisions are the points of the compass. From the lower side of this thin horizontal plate stand out four small wires, to which is fixed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TWILIGHT\">twilight</a> circle $18$ degrees from the graduated side of the horizon all round. This horizon may be put upon the earth (when the cap is taken away), and rectified to the latitude of any place; and then by a small wire called the solar ray, which may be put on so as to proceed directly from the sun's centre towards the earth's, but to come no farther than almost to touch the horizon. The beginning of twilight, time of sunrise, with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMPLITUDE\">amplitude</a>, meridian altitude, time of setting, amplitude then, and end of twilight, are shown for every day of the year, at that place to which the horizon is rectified.\n\nThe moon (No. 5.) goes round the earth, from between it and any fixed point at a great distance, in $27$ days $7$ hours $43$ minutes, or through all the signs and degrees of her orbit, which is called her periodical revolution; but she goes round from the sun to the sun again, or from change to change, in $29$ days $12$ hours $35$ minutes, which is her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYNODICAL\">synodical</a> revolution; and in that time she exhibits all the phases already described.\n\nWhen the above-mentioned horizon is rectified to the latitude of any given place, the times of the moon's rising and setting, together with her amplitude, are shown to that place as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the sun's; and all the various phenomena of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a>-moon are made obvious to sight.\n\nThe moon's orbit (No. 9.) is inclined to the ecliptic (No. 11.) one half being above, and the other below it. The nodes, or points at $\\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPHA\">alpha</a>$ and $\\omega$, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in the plane of the ecliptic, as before described, and shift backward through all its lines and degrees in $18\\frac{1}{2}$ years. The degrees of the moon's latitude to the highest at NL (north latitude) and lowest at SL (south latitude), are engraved both ways from her nodes at $\\alpha$ and $\\omega$, and as the moon rises and falls in her orbit according to its inclination, her latitude and distance from her nodes are shown for every day, having first rectified her orbit so as to let the nodes to their proper places in the ecliptic; and then as they come about at different and almost opposite times of the year, and then point towards the sun, all the eclipses may be shown for hundreds of years (without any new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTIFICATION\">rectification</a>) by turning the machinery backward for time past, or forward for time to come. At $17$ degrees distance from each node, on both sides, is engraved a small sun; and at $12$ degrees distance, a small moon, which show the limits of solar and lunar eclipses; and when, at any change, the moon falls between either of these suns and the node, the sun will be eclipsed on the day pointed to by the annual index (No. 10.); and as the moon has then north or south latitude, one may easily judge whether that eclipse will be visible in the northern or southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEMISPHERE\">hemisphere</a>: especially as the earth's axis inclines toward the sun or from him at that time. And when at any full the moon falls between either of the little moons and node, she will be eclipsed, and the annual index shows the day of that eclipse. There is a circle of $29\\frac{1}{2}$ equal parts (No. 8.) on the cover of the machine, on which an index shows the days of the moon's age.\n\nThere are two semicircles (fig. 163.) fixed to an elliptical ring, which being put like a cap upon the earth, and the forked part F upon the moon, shows the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> as the earth turns round within them, and they are led round it by the moon. When the different places come to the semicircle AaEBB, they have tides of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>; and when then come to the semicircle CED, they have tides of ebb; the index on the hour-circle (fig. 162.) showing the times of these phenomena.\n\nThere is a jointed wire, of which one end being put into a hole in the upright stem that holds the earth's cap, and the wire laid into a small forked piece which may be occasionally put upon Venus or Mercury, shows the direct and retrograde motions of these two planets, with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a> times and places as seen from the earth.\nThe whole machinery is turned by a winch or handle (No. 12); and is so easily moved, that a clock might turn it without any danger of stopping.\n\nTo give a plate of the wheel-work of this machine would answer no purpose, because many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> lie so behind others as to hide them from sight in any view whatever.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANETARIUM\">Planetarium</a> (fig. 164.) is an instrument contrived by Mr William Jones of Holborn, London, mathematical instrument maker, who has paid considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to those sort of machines, in order to reduce them to their greatest degree of simplicity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>. It represents in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> manner, by various parts of its machinery, all the motions and phenomena of the planetary system. This machine consists of, the Sun (in the centre), with the planets, Mercury, Venus, the Earth and Moon, Mars, Jupiter and his four moons, Saturn and his five moons; and to it is occasionally applied an extra <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> for the Georgian planet and his two moons. To the earth and moon is applied a frame CD, containing only four wheels and two pinions, which serve to preserve the earth's axis in its proper parallelism in its motion round the sun, and to give the moon her due revolution about the earth at the same time. These wheels are connected with the wheel-work in the round box below, and the whole is set in motion by the winch H. The arm M that carries round the moon, points out on the plate C her age and phases for any situation in her orbit, and which accordingly are engraved thereon. In the same manner the arm points out her place in the ecliptic B, in signs and degrees, called her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GEOCENTRIC\">geocentric</a> place; that is, as seen from the earth. The moon's orbit is represented by the flat rim A; the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> of which, and upon which it turns, denoting her nodes. This orbit is made to incline to any desired angle. The earth of this instrument is usually made of a three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> or 1\u00bd globe, papered, &c., for the purpose; and by means of the terminating wire that goes over it, points out the changes of the seasons, and the different lengths of days and nights more conspicuously. This machine is also made to represent the Ptolemaic System, or such as is vulgarly received; which places the earth in the centre, and the planets and sun revolving about it. (It is done by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AUXILIARY\">auxiliary</a> small sun and an earth, which change their places in the instrument.) At the same time, it affords a most manifest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of it: for it is plainly observed in this construction, (1.) That the planets Mercury and Venus, being both within the orbit of the sun, cannot at any time be seen to go behind it; whereas in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> we observe them as often to go behind as before the sun in the heavens. (2.) It shows, that as the planets move in circular orbits about the central earth, they ought at all times to be of the same apparent magnitudes; whereas, on the contrary, we observe their apparent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> in the heavens to be very variable, and so far different, that, for instance, Mars will sometimes appear as big as Jupiter nearly, and at other times you will scarcely know him from a fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a>. (3.) It shows that any of the planets might be seen at all distances from the sun in the heavens; or, in other words, that when the sun is setting, Mercury or Venus may be seen not only in the south but even in the east; which circumstances were never yet observed.\n\n(4.) You see by this planetarium that the motions of the planets should always be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> and uniformly the same; whereas, on the contrary, we observe them always to move with a variable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a>, sometimes faster, then slower, and sometimes not at all, as will be presently shown. (5.) By the machine you see the planets move all the same way, viz. from west to east continually; but in the heavens we see them move sometimes direct from west to east, sometimes retrograde from east to west, and at other times to be stationary. All which phenomena plainly prove this system to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> and absurd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>.\n\nThe truth of the Copernican or Solar System of the world is hereby most clearly represented. For taking the earth from the centre, and placing thereon the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> brass ball for the sun, and restoring the earth to its proper situation among the planets, then every thing will be right and agree exactly with celestial observations. For turning the winch H, (1.) You will see the planets Mercury and Venus go both before and behind the sun, or have two conjunctions. (2.) You will observe Mercury never to be more than a certain angular distance, 21\u00b0, and Venus 47\u00b0, from the sun. (3.) That the planets, especially Mars, will be sometimes much nearer to the earth than at others, and therefore must appear larger at one time than at another. (4.) You will see that the planets cannot appear at the earth to move with an uniform velocity; for when nearest they appear to move faster, and slower when most remote. (5.) You will observe the planets will appear at the earth to move sometimes directly from west to east, and then to become retrograde from east to west, and between both to be stationary or without any apparent motion at all. Which particulars all correspond exactly with observations, and fully prove the truth of this excellent system.\n\nFig. 165. represents an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> to show these latter particulars more evidently. An hollow wire, with a flit at top, is placed over the arm of the planet Mercury or Venus at E. The arm DG represents a ray of light coming from the planet at D to the earth, and is put over the centre which carries the earth at F. The planets being then put in motion, the planet D, as seen in the heavens from the earth at F, will undergo the several changes of position as above described. The wire prop that is over Mercury at E, may be placed over the other superior planets, Mars, &c., and the same phenomena be exhibited.\n\nBy this machine you at once see all the planets in motion about the sun, with the same respective velocities and periods of revolution which they have in the heavens; the wheel-work being calculated to a minute of time, from the latest discoveries.\n\nYou will see here a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> of the earth's motion about the sun, as well as those of the rest of the planets: for if the earth were to be at rest in the heavens, then the time between any two conjunctions of the same kind, or oppositions, would be the same with the periodical time of the planets, viz. 88 days in Mercury, 225 in Venus, &c.; whereas you here observe this time, instead of being 225 days, is no less than 583 days in Venus, occasioned by the earth's moving in the mean time about the sun the same way with the planet. And this space of 583 days always passes between two like conjunctions of Venus in the heavens.\nThe satellites of Jupiter and Saturn are moveable only by the hand; yet may all their phenomena be easily represented, excepting the true relative motions and distances. Thus, if that gilt globe which before represented the sun be made now to denote Jupiter, and four of the primary planets only be retained, then will the Jovian system be represented; and, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> light only, you will see (the machine being in motion) the immersions and emergences of the satellites into and out of Jupiter's shadow. You will see plainly the manner in which they transit his body, and their occultations behind it. You will observe the various ways in which one or more of these moons may at times disappear. And if the machine be set by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> wall, &c., then by the projection of their shadows will be seen the reasons why those moons always appear on each side of Jupiter in a right line, why those which are most remote may appear nearest, and *\u00e9 contrario*. And the same may be done for Saturn's five moons and his ring.\n\n**The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of Rectifying the Orrery, and the proper Manner of placing the Planets in their true Situations.**\n\nHaving dwelled thus much on the description of orreries, it may be useful to young readers, to point out the method by which the orrery should be first rectified, previous to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> or using of it: and the following is extracted from Mr William Jones's description of his new Portable Orrery. \"The method of showing the places, and relative aspects of the planets on any day of the year in the planetarium, must be done by the affiance of an ephemeris or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALMANACK\">almanack</a>, which among other almanacks is published annually by the Stationers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a>.\"\n\n\"The ephemeris contains a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIARY\">diary</a> or daily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the planets places in the heavens, in signs, degrees, and minutes, both as they appear to the eye supposed to be at the sun, and at the earth, throughout the year. The first of these positions is called the heliocentric place, and the latter, the geocentric place. The heliocentric place is that made use of in orreries; the geocentric place, that in globes. As an example for finding their places, and setting them right in the orrery, we will suppose the ephemeris (by White, which for this purpose is considered the best) at hand, wherein at the bottom of the left-hand page for every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> is the heliocentric longitudes (or places) of all the planets to every six days of the month; which is near enough for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> use: A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of one of these tables for March 1784 is here inserted for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> of the tyro.\"\nAppendix.\n\n\"Astronomy.\"\n\n\"Now as an example, we will suppose, that in order to let the planets of the orrery, we want their heliocentric places for the 21st of this month. Looking into the table, we take the 19th day, which is the nearest to the day wanted; then, accordingly, we find the place of Saturn (h), in 17\u00b0 17', or 17 degrees (rejecting the minutes, being in this case useless); of Capricornus (v), of Jupiter (u), in 18\u00b0 of Aquarius (w), Mars (q) in 10\u00b0 of Cancer (x), the sun (s) in 29\u00b0 of Virgo (m), Venus (g) in 29\u00b0 of Sagittarius (f), Mercury (y) in 28 degrees of the same sign; and in the same manner for any other day therein specified. Upon even this circumstance depends a very pleasing astronomical praxis, by which the young tyro may at any time be able to entertain himself in a most rational and agreeable manner, viz. he may in a minute or two represent the true appearance of the planetary system just as it really is in the heavens, and for any day he pleases, by aligning to each planet its proper place in its orbit; as in the following manner: For the 19th of March, as before, the place of Saturn is in 17\u00b0 of Capricornus (v); now laying hold of the arm of Saturn in the orrery, you place it over or against the 17\u00b0 of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPRICORN\">Capricorn</a> on the ecliptic circle, constantly placed on or surrounding the instrument; thus doing the same for the other planets, they will have the proper heliocentric places for that day.\n\n\"Now in this situation of the planets, we observe, that if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> was placed on the earth, he would see Venus and Jupiter in the same line and place of the ecliptic, consequently in the heavens they would appear together or in conjunction; Mercury a little to the left or eastward of them, and nearer to the sun; Saturn to the right, or westward, farther from the sun; Mars directly opposite to Saturn; so that when Saturn appears in the west, Mars appears in the east and vice versa. Several other curious and entertaining particulars, as depending on the above, may be easily represented and shown by the learner; particularly the foregoing when the winch is turned, and all the planets set into their respective motions.\"\n\nWe cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> this detail on orreries more agreeably than by the following account of an instrument of that sort invented by Mr James Ferguson, to which he gives the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">Mechanical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARADOX\">Paradox</a>, and which is actuated by means of what may, as he observes, even good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, would be ready to pronounce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, viz. That the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> of one wheel taking equally deep into the teeth of three others, should affect them in such a manner, that in turning it any way round its axis, it should turn one of them the same way, another the contrary way, and the third no way at all.\n\nThe solution of the paradox is given under the article Mechanics; after which our author proceeds to give the following account of its uses. \"This machine is so much of an orrery, as is sufficient to show the different lengths of days and nights, the vicissitudes of the seasons, the retrograde motion of the nodes of the moon's orbit, the direct motion of the apogeeal point of her orbit, and the months in which the sun and moon must be eclipsed.\n\n\"On the great immovable plate A (see fig. 167.) are the months and days of the year, and the signs and degrees of the zodiac so placed, that when the annual index b is brought to any given day of the year, it will point to the degree of the sign in which the sun is on that day. The index is fixed to the moveable frame BC, and is carried round the immovable plate with it, by means of the knob n. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> this frame and index round the immovable plate, answers to the earth's annual motion round the sun, and to the sun's apparent motion round the ecliptic in a year.\n\n\"The central wheel D (being fixed on the axis a, which is fixed in the centre of the immovable plate) turns the thick wheel E round its own axis by the motion of the frame; and the teeth of the wheel E take into the teeth of the three wheels F, G, H, whose axes turn with one another, like the axis of the hour, minute, and second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of a clock or watch, where the seconds are shown from the centre of the dial-plate.\n\n\"On the upper ends of these axes, are the round plates I, K, L; the plate I being on the axis of the wheel F, K on the axis of G, and L on the axis of H. So that whichever way these wheels are affected, their respective plates, and what they support, must be affected in the same manner; each wheel and plate being independent of the others.\n\n\"The two upright wires M and N are fixed into the plate I; and they support the small ecliptic OP, on which, in the machine, the signs and degrees of the ecliptic are marked. This plate also supports the small terrestrial globe e, on its inclining axis f, which is fixed into the plate near the foot of the wire N. This axis inclines 23\u00bd degrees from a right line, supposed to be perpendicular to the surface of the plate I, and also to the plane of the small ecliptic OP, which is parallel to that plate.\n\n\"On the earth e is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRESCENT\">crescent</a> g, which goes more than half way round the earth, and stands perpendicular to the plane of the small ecliptic OP, directly facing the sun Z: Its use is to divide the enlightened half of the earth next the sun from the other half which is then in the dark; so that it represents the boundary of light and darkness, and therefore ought to go quite round the earth; but cannot in a machine, because in some positions the earth's axis would fall upon it. The earth may be freely turned round on its axis by hand, within the crescent, which is supported by the crooked wire w, fixed to it, and into the upper plate of the moveable frame BC.\n\n\"In the plate K are fixed the two upright wires Q and R: they support the moon's inclined orbits ST in its nodes, which are the two opposite points of the moon's orbit where it intersects the ecliptic OP. The ascending node is marked S, to which the descending node is opposite below e, but hid from view by the globe e. The half S T of this orbit is on the north side of the ecliptic OP, and the other half e S is on the south side of the ecliptic. The moon is not in this machine; but when she is in either of the nodes of her orbit in the heavens, she is then in the plane of the ecliptic: when she is at T in her orbit, she is in her greatest north latitude; and when she is at S, she is in her greatest south latitude.\n\n\"In the plate L is fixed the crooked wire UU, which points downward to the small ecliptic OP, and shows the motion of the moon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOGEE\">apogee</a> therein, and its place at any given time.\"\nThe ball Z represents the sun, which is supported by the crooked wire XY, fixed into the upper plate of the frame at X. A straight wire W proceeds from the sun Z, and points always towards the centre of the earth e; but toward different points of its surface at different times of the year, on account of the obliquity of its axis, which keeps its parallelism during the earth's annual course round the sun Z; and therefore must incline sometimes toward the sun, at other times from him, and twice in the year neither toward nor from the sun, but fidelike to him. The wire W is called the solar ray.\n\nAs the annual-index b shows the sun's place in the ecliptic for every day of the year, by turning the frame round the axis of the immoveable plate A, according to the order of the months and signs, the solar ray does the same in the small ecliptic OP; for as this ecliptic has no motion on its axis, its signs and degrees still keep parallel to those on the immoveable plate. At the same time, the nodes of the moon's orbit ST (or points where it intersects the ecliptic OP) are moved backward, or contrary to the order of signs, at the rate of 19\u00b045' degrees every Julian year; and the moon's apogee wire UU is moved forward, or according to the order of the signs of the ecliptic, nearly at the rate of 41\u00b0 degrees every Julian year; the year being denoted by a revolution of the earth e round the sun Z; in which time the annual index b goes round the circles of months and signs, on the immoveable plate A.\n\nTake hold of the knob n, and turn the frame round thereby; and in doing this, you will perceive that the north pole of the earth e is constantly before the crescent g, in the enlightened part of the earth toward the sun, from the 20th of March to the 23rd of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>; and the south pole all that time behind the crescent in the dark; and from the 23rd of September to the 20th of March, the north pole as constantly in the dark behind the crescent, and the south pole in the light before it; which shows, that there is but one day and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> at each pole, in the whole year; and that when it is day at either pole, it is night at the other.\n\nFrom the 20th of March to the 23rd of September, the days are longer than the nights in all those places of the northern hemisphere of the earth which revolve through the light and dark, and shorter in those of the southern hemisphere. From the 23rd of September to the 20th of March, the reverse.\n\nThere are 24 meridian semicircles drawn on the globe, all meeting in its poles; and as one rotation or turn of the earth on its axis is performed in 24 hours, each of these meridians is an hour distant from the other, in every parallel of latitude. Therefore, if you bring the annual index b to any given day of the year, on the immoveable plate, you may see how long the day then is at any place of the earth, by counting how many of these meridians are in the light, or before the crescent, in the parallel of latitude of that place; and this number being subtracted from 24 hours, will leave remaining the length of the night. And if you turn the earth round its axis, all those places will pass directly under the point of the solar ray, which the sun passes vertically over on that day, because they are just as many degrees north or south of the equator as the sun's declination is then from the equinoctial.\n\nAt the two equinoxes, viz. on the 20th of March and 23rd of September, the sun is in the equinoctial, and consequently has no declination. On these days, the solar ray points directly toward the equator, the earth's poles lie under the inner edge of the crescent, or boundary of light and darkness; and in every parallel of latitude there are 12 of the meridians or hour-circles before the crescent, and 12 behind it, which shows that the days and nights then are each 12 hours long at all places of the earth. And if the earth be turned round its axis, you will see that all places on it go equally through the light and the dark hemispheres.\n\nOn the 21st of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, the whole space within the north polar circle is enlightened, which is 23\u00b045' degrees from the pole, all around; because the earth's axis then inclines 23\u00b045' degrees toward the sun; but the whole space within the south polar circle is in the dark; and the solar ray points toward the tropic of Cancer on the earth, which is 23\u00b045' degrees north from the equator. On the 21st of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> the reverse happens, and the solar ray points toward the tropic of Capricorn, which is 23\u00b045' degrees south from the equator.\n\nIf you bring the annual-index b to the beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a>, and turn the moon's orbit ST by its supporting wires Q and R till the ascending node (marked N) comes to its place in the ecliptic OP, as found by an ephemeris, or by astronomical tables, for the beginning of any given year; and then move the annual-index by means of the knob n, till the index comes to any given day of the year afterward, the nodes will stand against their places in the ecliptic on that day; and if you move on the index till either of the nodes comes directly against the point of the solar ray, the index will then be at the day of the year on which the sun is in conjunction with that node. At the times of those new moons which happen within seventeen days of the conjunction of the sun with either of the nodes, the sun will be eclipsed; and at the times of those full moons, which happen within twelve days of either of these conjunctions, the moon will be eclipsed. Without these limits there can be no eclipses either of the sun or moon; because, in nature, the moon's latitude or declination from the ecliptic is too great for the moon's shadow to fall on any part of the earth, or for the earth's shadow to touch the moon.\n\nBring the annual-index to the beginning of January, and set the moon's apogee wire UU to its place in the ecliptic for that time, as found by astronomical tables; then move the index forward to any given day of the year, and the wire will point on the small ecliptic to the place of the moon's apogee for that time.\n\nThe earth's axis f inclines always toward the beginning of the sign Cancer on the small ecliptic OP. And if you set either of the moon's nodes, and her apogee wire to the beginning of that sign, and turn the plate A about, until the earth's axis inclines toward any side of the room (suppose the north side), and then move the annual-index round and round the immoveable plate A, according to the order of the months.\nAppendix.\n\nA S T R O N O M Y.\n\nDescription months and signs upon it, you will see that the earth's axis and beginning of Cancer will still keep towards the same side of the room, without the least deviation from it; but the nodes of the moon's orbit ST will turn progressively towards all the sides of the room, contrary to the order of signs in the small ecliptic OP, or from east, by south, to west, and so on; and the apogee wire UU will turn the contrary way to the motion of the nodes, or according to the order of the signs in the small ecliptic, from west, by south, to east, and so on quite round. A clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that the wheel F, which governs the earth's axis and the small ecliptic, does not turn any way round its own centre; that the wheel G, which governs the moon's orbit OP, turns round its own centre backward, or contrary both to the motion of the frame BC and thick wheel E; and that the wheel H, which governs the moon's apogee wire UU, turns round its own centre forward, or in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> both of the motion of the frame and of the thick wheel E, by which the three wheels F, G, and H, are affected.\n\n\"The wheels D, E, and F, have each 39 teeth in the machine; the wheel G has 37, and H 44.\n\n\"The parallelism of the earth's axis is perfect in this machine; the motion of the apogee very nearly so; the motion of the nodes not quite so near the truth, though they will not vary sensibly therefrom in one year. But they cannot be brought nearer, unless larger wheels, with higher numbers of teeth, are used.\n\n\"In nature, the moon's apogee goes quite round the ecliptic in 8 years and 312 days, in direction of the earth's annual motion; and the nodes go round the ecliptic, in a contrary direction, in 18 years and 225 days. In the machine, the apogee goes round the ecliptic OP in eight years and four-fifths of a year, and the nodes in 18 years and a half.\"\n\nThe Cometarium, (fig. 168.) This curious machine shows the motion of a comet or eccentric body moving round the sun, describing equal areas in equal times, and may be so contrived as to show such a motion for any degrees of eccentricity. It was invented by the late Dr Defaguliers.\n\nThe dark elliptical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a> round the letters a b c d e f g h i k l m is the orbit of the comet Y; this comet is carried round in the groove according to the order of letters, by the wire W fixed in the sun S, and slides on the wire as it approaches nearer to or recedes farther from the sun, being nearest of all in the perihelion a, and farthest in the aphelion g. The areas, a S b, b S c, c S d, &c., or contents of these several triangles, are all equal; and in every turn of the winch N, the comet Y is carried over one of these areas; consequently, in as much time as it moves from f to g, or from g to h, it moves from m to a, or from a to b; and so of the rest, being quickest of all at a, and slowest at g. Thus the comet's velocity in its orbit continually decreases from the perihelion a to the aphelion g; and increases in the same proportion from g to a.\n\nThe elliptic orbit is divided into 12 equal parts or signs, with their respective degrees, and so is the circle n o p q r s t u, which represents a great circle in the heavens, and to which the comet's motion is referred by a small knob on the point of the wire W. Whilst the comet moves from f to g in its orbit, it appears to move only about five degrees in this circle, as is shown by the small knob on the end of the wire W; but in as short time as the comet moves from m to a, or from a to b, it appears to describe the large space t n or n o in the heavens, either of which spaces contains 120 degrees, or four signs. Were the eccentricity of its orbit greater, the greater still would be the difference of its motion, and vice versa.\n\nABCDEFGHIKLM is a circular orbit for showing the equable motion of a body round the sun S, describing equal areas ASB, BSC, &c., in equal times with those of the body Y in its elliptical orbit above mentioned; but with this difference, that the circular motion describes the equal arcs AB, BC, &c., in the same equal times that the elliptical motion describes the unequal arcs a b, b c, &c.\n\nNow suppose the two bodies Y and I to start from the points a and A at the same moment of time, and each having gone round its respective orbit, to arrive at these points again at the same instant, the body Y will be forwarder in its orbit than the body I all the way from a to g, and from A to G; but I will be forwarder than Y through all the other half of the orbit; and the difference is equal to the equation of the body Y in its orbit. At the points a A, and g G, that is, that in the perihelion and aphelion, they will be equal; and then the equation vanishes. This shows why the equation of a body moving in an elliptic orbit is added to the mean or supposed circular motion from the perihelion to the aphelion, and subtracted from the aphelion to the perihelion, in bodies moving round the sun, or from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIGEE\">perigee</a> to the apogee, and from the apogee to the perigee in the moon's motion round the earth.\n\nThis motion is performed in the following manner by the machine, fig. 169. ABC is a wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> (in the box containing the wheel-work), above which are the wheels D and E, and below it the elliptic plates FF and GG; each plate being fixed on an axis in one of its fociuses, at E and K; and the wheel E is fixed on the same axis with the plate FF. These plates have grooves round their edges precisely of equal diameters to one another, and in these grooves is the cat-gut string gg, gg crofting between the plates at h. On H, the axis of the handle or winch N in fig. 216, is an endless screw in fig. 217, working in the wheels D and E, whose numbers of teeth being equal, and should be equal to the number of lines, a S, b S, c S, &c., in fig. 168, they turn round their axis in equal times to one another, and to the motion of the elliptic plates. For, the wheels D and E having equal numbers of teeth, the plate FF being fixed on the same axis with the wheel E, and turning the equally big plate GG by a cat-gut string round them both, they must all go round their axis in as many turns of the handle N as either of the wheels has teeth.\n\nIt is easy to see, that the end b of the elliptical plate FF being farther from its axis E, than the opposite end I is, must describe a circle so much the larger in proportion, and therefore move through so much more space in the same time; and for that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> the end b moves so much faster than the end I, although it goes no sooner round the centre E. But then the quick-moving end b of the plate FF leads about the short end b K of the plate GG with the same velocity;\nDescription and the slow-moving end I of the plate FF coming half round as to B, must then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> the long end k of the plate GG as slowly about; so that the elliptical plate FF and its axis E move uniformly and equally quick in every part of its revolution; but the elliptical plate GG, together with its axis K, must move very unequally in different parts of its revolution; the difference being always inversely as the distance of any point of the circumference of GG from its axis at K: or in other words, to insinuate two points, if the distance K k be four, five, or six times as great as the distance K b, the point b will move in that position, four, five, or six times as fast as the point k does, when the plate GG has gone half round; and so on for any other eccentricity or difference of the distances K k and K b. The tooth I on the plate FF falls in between the two teeth at k on the plate GG; by which means the revolution of the latter is so adjusted to that of the former, that they can never vary from one another.\n\nOn the top of the axis of the equally-moving wheel D in fig. 169. is the sun S in fig. 168: which sun, by the wire fixed to it, carries the ball round the circle ABCD, &c., with an equable motion, according to the order of the letters: and on the top of the axis K of the unequally-moving ellipses GG, in fig. 169. is the sun S in fig. 168, carrying the ball Y unequally round in the elliptical groove a b c d, &c. N.B. This elliptical groove must be precisely equal and similar to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERGE\">verge</a> of the plate GG, which is also equal to that of FF.\n\nIn this manner machines may be made to show the true motion of the moon about the earth, or of any planet about the sun, by making the elliptical plates of the same eccentricities, in proportion to the radius, as the orbits of the planets are, whose motions they represent; and so their different equations in different parts of their orbits may be made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> to sight, and clearer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of these motions and equations acquired in half an hour, than could be gained from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> half a day about such motions and equations.\n\nThe Improved Celestial Globe, fig. 170. On the north pole of the axis, above the hour-circle, is fixed an arch MKH of 23\u00bd degrees; and at the end H is fixed an upright pin HG, which stands directly over the north pole of the ecliptic, and perpendicular to that part of the surface of the globe. On this pin are two moveable collets at E and H, to which are fixed the quadrantile wires N and O, having two little balls on their ends for the sun and moon, as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. The collet D is fixed to the circular plate F, whereon the 29\u00bd days of the moon's age are engraven, beginning just under the sun's wire N; and as this wire is moved round the globe, the plate F turns round with it. These wires are easily turned, if the screw G be slackened; and when they are set to their proper places, the screw serves to fix them there, so as in turning the ball of the globe, the wires with the sun and moon go round with it; and these two little balls rise and set at the same times, and on the same points of the horizon, for the day to which they are rectified, as the sun and moon do in the heavens.\n\nBecause the moon keeps not her course in the ecliptic (as the sun appears to do) but has a declination of 5\u00bd degrees on each side from it in every lunation, her ball may be screwed as many degrees to either side of the ecliptic as her latitude or declination from the ecliptic amounts to at any given time.\n\nThe horizon is supported by two semicircular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>, because pillars would stop the progress of the balls when they go below the horizon in an oblique sphere.\n\nTo rectify this globe. Elevate the pole to the latitude of the place; then bring the sun's place in the ecliptic for the given day to the brazen meridian, and set the hour index at 12 at noon, that is, to the upper 12 on the hour circle; keeping the globe in that situation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLACKEN\">slacken</a> the screw G, and let the sun directly over his place on the meridian; which done, let the moon's wire under the number that expresses her age for that day on the plate F, and she will then stand over her place in the ecliptic, and show what constellation she is in. Lastly, fasten the screw G, and adjust the moon to her latitude, and the globe will be rectified.\n\nHaving thus rectified the globe, turn it round, and observe on what point of the horizon the sun and moon balls rise and set, for they agree with the points of the compass on which the sun and moon rise and set in the heavens on the given day: and the hour index shows the time of their rising and setting; and likewise the time of the moon's passing over the meridian.\n\nThis simple apparatus shows all the varieties that can happen in the rising and setting of the sun and moon; and makes the forementioned phenomena of the harvest moon plain to the eye. It is also very useful in reading lectures on the globes, because a large company can see this sun and moon go round, rising above and setting below the horizon at different times, according to the seasons of the year; and making their appulses to different fixed stars. But in the usual way, where there is only the places of the sun and moon in the ecliptic to keep the eye upon, they are easily lost sight of, unless they be covered with patches.\n\nThe Trajectorium Lunare, fig. 171. This machine is for delineating the paths of the earth and moon, showing what sort of curves they make in the ethereal regions. S is the sun, and E the earth, whose centres are 95 inches distant from each other; every inch answering to 1,000,000 miles. M is the moon, whose centre is 1\u00bd parts of an inch from the earth's in this machine, this being in just proportion to the moon's distance from the earth. AA is a bar of wood, to be moved by hand round the axis g which is fixed in the wheel Y. The circumference of this wheel is to the circumference of the small wheel L (below the other end of the bar) as 365\u00bd days is to 29\u00bd, or as a year is to a lunation. The wheels are grooved round their edges, and in the grooves is the cat gut string GG crossing between the wheels at X. On the axis of the wheel L is the index F, in which is fixed the moon's axis M for carrying her round the earth E (fixed on the axis of the wheel L) in the time that the index goes round a circle of 29\u00bd equal parts, which are the days of the moon's age. The wheel Y has the months and days of the year all round its limb; and in the bar AA is fixed the index I, which points out the days of the months answering the days of the moon's age, shown by the index F, in the circle of 29\u00bd equal parts at the other end of the bar.\nAppendix.\n\nAstronomy.\n\nDescription of Astronomical Instruments.\n\nThe axis of the wheel L is put the piece D, below of Astronomical Instruments. the cock C, in which this axis turns round; and in D are put the pencils e and m directly under the earth E and moon M; so that m is carried round e as M is round E.\n\nLay the machine on an even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PRESSING\">pressing</a> gently on the wheel Y, to cause its spiked feet (of which two appear at P and P, the third being supposed to be hid from sight by the wheel) enter a little into the floor to secure the wheel from turning. Then lay a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> about four feet long under the pencils e and m, crookedwise to the bar; which done, move the bar slowly round the axis g of the wheel Y; and as the earth E goes round the sun S, the moon M will go round the earth with a duly proportioned velocity; and the friction wheel W running on the floor, will keep the bar from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> too heavily on the pencils e and m, which will delineate the paths of the earth and moon. As the index I points out the days of the months, the index F shows the moon\u2019s age on these days, in the circle of 29\u00bd equal parts. And as this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> index points to the different days in its circle, the like numeral figures may be set to those parts of the curves of the earth\u2019s path and moon\u2019s where the pencils e and m are at those times respectively, to show the places of the earth and moon. If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> e be pushed a very little off, as if from the pencil m, to about \u00bc part of their distance, and the pencil m pushed as much towards e, to bring them to the same distances again, though not to the same points of space; then, as m goes round e, e will go as it were round the centre of gravity between the earth e and moon m; but this motion will not sensibly alter the figure of the earth\u2019s path or the moon\u2019s.\n\nIf a pin, as p, be put through the pencil m, with its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> towards that of the pin q in the pencil e, its head will always keep thereto as m goes round e, or as the same side of the moon is still obverted to the earth. But the pin p, which may be considered as an equatorial diameter of the moon, will turn quite round the point m, making all possible angles with the line of its progress, or line of the moon\u2019s path. This is an ocular proof of the moon\u2019s turning round her axis.\n\nIII. A Description of the principal Astronomical Instruments by which Astronomers make the most accurate Observations.\n\nBy practical astronomy is implied the knowledge of observing the celestial bodies with respect to their position and time of the year, and of deducing from those observations certain conclusions useful in calculating the time when any proposed position of these bodies shall happen.\n\nFor this purpose, it is necessary to have a room or place conveniently situated, suitably contrived, and furnished with proper astronomical instruments. It should have an uninterrupted view from the zenith <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to (or even below) the horizon, at least towards its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">cardinal</a> points; and for this purpose, that part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> which lies in the direction of the meridian, in particular, should have moveable covers, which may easily be moved and put on again; by which means an instrument may be directed to any point of the heavens between the horizon and the zenith, as well to the northward as southward.\n\nThis place, called an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">Observatory</a>, should contain some, if not all, of the following instruments:\n\nI. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENDULUM\">Pendulum</a> Clock, for showing equal time. This should show time in hours, minutes, and seconds; and with which the observer, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> the beats of the pendulum, may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> them by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>, while his eye is employed on the motion of the celestial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> he is observing. Just before the object arrives at the position described, the observer should look on the clock and remark the time, suppose it 9 hours 15 minutes 25 seconds; then saying, 25, 26, 27, 28, &c., responsive to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> of the pendulum, till he sees through the instrument the object arrived at the position expected; which suppose to happen when he says 38, he then writes down 9 h. 15 min. 38 sec. for the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, annexing the year and the day of the month. If two persons are concerned in making the observation, one may read the time audibly while the other observes through the instrument, the observer repeating the last second read when the desired position happens.\n\nII. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACHROMATIC\">Achromatic</a> Refracting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-TELESCOPE\">Telescope</a>, or a reflecting one, of two feet at least in length, for observing particular phenomena. These instruments are particularly described under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">Optics</a>.\n\nIII. A Micrometer, for measuring small angular distances. See Micrometer.\n\nIV. Astronomical Quadrants, both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURAL\">mural</a> and portable, for observing meridian and other altitudes of the celestial bodies.\n\n1. The mural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a> is in the form of a quarter of a circle, contained under two radii at right angles to one another, and an arch equal to one fourth part of the circumference of the circle. It is the most useful and valuable of all the astronomical instruments; and as it is sometimes fixed to the side of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> or brick wall, and the plane of it erected exactly in the plane of the meridian, it in this case receives the name of mural quadrant or arch.\n\nTycho-Brahe was the first person who contrived this mural arch, viz. who first applied it to a wall; and Mr Flamsteed, the first in England who, with indefatigable pains, fixed one up in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> observatory at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a>.\n\nThese instruments have usually been made from five to eight feet radius, and executed by those late celebrated artists Sisson, Graham, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIRD\">Bird</a>, and other eminent mathematical instrument makers in London. The construction of them being generally the same in all the sizes, we shall here describe one made by the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOB\">Job</a>. Sisson, under the direction of the late Mr. Graham. Fig. 172 represents the instrument as already fixed to the wall. It is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, and of about five feet radius. The frame is formed of flat bars, and strengthened by edge bars affixed underneath perpendicularly to them. The radii HB, HA, being divided each into four equal parts, serve to find out the points D and E, by which the quadrant is freely suspended on its props or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> supports that are fastened securely in the wall.\n\nOne of the supports E is represented separately in e on one side of the quadrant. It is moveable by means of a long slender rod EF or ef, which goes into a hole Z 2 low\nlow screw in order to restore the instrument to its situation when it is discovered to be a little deranged. This may be known by the very fine perpendicular thread HA, which ought always to coincide with the same point A of the limb, and carefully examined to be so by a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNIFYING\">magnifying</a> telescope at every observation. In order to prevent the unsteadiness of so great a machine, there should be placed behind the limb four copper ears with double cocks I, K, I, K. There are others along the radii HA and HB. Each of these cocks contains two screws, into which are fastened the ears that are fixed behind the quadrant.\n\nOver the wall or stone which supports the instrument, and at the same height as the centre, is placed horizontally the axis PO, which is perpendicular to the plane of the instrument, and which would pass through the centre if it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>. This axis turns on two pivots P. On this axis is fixed at right angles another branch ON, loaded at its extremity with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> N capable of equilibrating with its weight that of the telescope LM; whilst the axis, by its extremity nearest the quadrant, carries the wooden frame PRM, which is fastened to the telescope in M. The counterpoise takes off from the observer the weight of the telescope when he raises it, and hinders him from either forcing or straining the instrument.\n\nThe lower extremity (V) of the telescope is furnished with two small wheels, which take the limb of the quadrant on its two sides. The telescope hardly bears any more upon the limb than the small friction of these two wheels; which renders its motion so extremely easy and pleasant, that by giving it with the hand only a small motion, the telescope will run itself over a great part of the limb, balanced by the counterpoise N.\n\nWhen the telescope is to be stopped at a certain position, the copper hand T is to be made use of, which embraces the limb and springs at the bottom. It is fixed by setting a screw, which fastens it to the limb. Then, in turning the regulating screw, the telescope will be advanced; which is continued until the star or other object whose altitude is observing be on the horizontal fine thread in the telescope. Then on the plate X supporting the telescope, and carrying a vernier or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NONIUS\">nonius</a>, will be seen the number of degrees and minutes, and even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of minutes, that the angular height of the object observed is equal to. The remainder is easily estimated within two or three seconds nearly.\n\nThere are several methods of subdividing the divisions of a mural quadrant, which are usually from five to ten minutes each; but that which is most commonly adopted is by the vernier or nonius, the contrivance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> Vernier a Frenchman. This vernier consists of a piece of copper or brass, CDAB (fig. 173.), which is a small portion of X (fig. 172.) represented separately. The length CD is divided into 20 equal parts, and placed contiguously on a portion of the division of the limb of the quadrant containing 25 divisions, and thereby dividing this length into 20 equal parts. Thus the first division of the vernier piece marked 15, beginning at the point D, is a little nearer backward, or to the left of the first division of the limb equal to 15. The second division of the vernier is to the left of the second division of the limb double of the first division difference, or 30\"; and so on unto the 20th and last of all divisions on the left of the vernier piece; where the differences being accumulated each of the 20th part of the division of the limb, this last division will be found to agree exactly with the 21st division on the limb of the quadrant.\n\nThe index must be pushed the 20th part of a division, or 15\", to the right; for to make the second division on the vernier coincide with one of the divisions of the limb, in like manner is moving two 20ths, or 30\", we must look at the second division of the index, and there will be a coincidence with a division of the limb. Thus may be conceived that the beginning D of the vernier, which is always the line of reckoning, has advanced two divisions, or 30\", to the right, when the second division, marked 30 on the vernier, is seen to correspond exactly with one of the lines of the quadrant.\n\nBy means of this vernier may be readily distinguished the exactitude of 1/4\" of the limb of a quadrant five feet radius, and simply divided into 5'. By an estimation by the eye, afterwards, the accuracy of two or three seconds may be easily judged. On the side of the quadrant is placed the plate of copper which carries the telescope. This plate carries two verniers. The outer line CD divides five minutes into 20 parts, or 15\" each. The interior line AB answers to the parts of another division not having 90\u00b0, but 96 parts of the quadrant. It is usually adopted by English astronomers on account of the facility of its subdivisions. Each of the 96 portions of the quadrant is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to 56' 15\" of the usual divisions. It is divided on the limb into 16 parts, and the arch of the vernier AB contains 25 of these divisions; and being divided itself into 24, immediately gives parts, the value of each of which is 8\u00b0 47\u00bd\". From this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> a table of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> may easily be constructed, which will serve to find the value of this second mode of dividing in degrees, minutes, and seconds, reckoning in the usual manner, and to have even the advantage of two different modes; which makes an excellent verification of the divisions on the limb of the quadrant and observed heights by the vernier.\n\n2. The Portable Astronomical Quadrant, is that instrument of all others which astronomers make the greatest use of, and have the most esteem for. They are generally made from 12 to 23 inches. Fig. 174. is a representation of the improved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> one as made by the late Mr Sisson and by the present mathematical instrument makers. This is capable of being carried to any part of the world, and put up for observation in an easy and accurate manner. It is made of brass, and strongly framed together by crossed perpendicular bars. The arch AC, and telescope EF, are divided and constructed in a similar manner to the mural quadrant, but generally without the division of 96 parts. The counterpoise to the telescope T is represented at P, and also another counterpoise to the quadrant itself at P. The quadrant is fixed to a long axis, which goes into the pillar KR. Upon this axis is fixed an index, which points to and subdivides by a vernier the divisions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AZIMUTH\">azimuth</a> circle K. This azimuth circle is extremely useful for taking the azimuth of a celestial body at the same time its altitude is observed.\nAppendix.\n\nAstronomy.\n\nThe upper end of the axis is firmly connected with the adjusting frame GH; and the pillar is supported on the crooked feet at the bottom of the pillar KR with the adjusting screws a, b, c, d.\n\nWhen this instrument is set up for use or observation, it is necessary that two adjustments be very accurately made: One, that the plane or surface of the instrument be truly perpendicular to the horizon; the other, that the line supposed to be drawn from the centre to the first line of the limb, be truly on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> or parallel with the horizon. The first of these particulars is done by means of the thread and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUMMET\">plummet</a> p; the thread of which is usually of very fine silver wire, and it is placed opposite to a mark made upon the end of the limb of the instrument. The four screws at the foot, a, b, c, d, are to be turned until a perfect coincidence is observed of the thread upon the mark, which is accurately observed by means of a small telescope T, that fits to the limb. The other adjustment is effected by means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> level L, which applies on the frame GH, and the small screws turned as before until the bubble of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> in the level settles in the middle of the tube. The dotted tube EB is a kind of prover to the instrument: for by observing at what mark the centre of it appears against, or by putting up a mark against it, it will at any time discover if the instrument has been displaced. The screw S at the index, is the regulating or adjusting screw, to move the telescope and index, during the observation, with the utmost nicety.\n\nV. Astronomical or Equatorial Sector. This is an instrument for finding the difference in right ascension and declination between two objects, the distance of which is too great to be observed by the micrometer. It was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of the late ingenious Mr George Graham, F.R.S., and is constructed from the following particulars. Let AB (fig. 175.) represent an arch of a circle containing 10 or 12 degrees well divided, having a strong plate CD for its radius, fixed to the middle of the arch at D: let this radius be applied to the side of an axis HFI, and be moveable about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> fixed to it at F, so that the plane of the sector may be always parallel to the axis HI; which being parallel to the axis of the earth, the plane of the sector will always be parallel to the plane of some hour-circle. Let a telescope CE be moveable about the centre C of the arch AB, from one end of it to the other, by turning a screw at G; and let the line of sight be parallel to the plane of the sector. Now, by turning the whole instrument about the axis HI, till the plane of it be successively directed, first to one of the stars and then to another, it is easy to move the sector about the joint F, into such a position, that the arch AB, when fixed, shall take in both the stars in their passage, by the plane of it, provided the difference of their declinations does not exceed the arch AB. Then, having fixed the plane of the sector a little to the westward of both the stars, move the telescope CE by the screw G; and observe by a clock the time of each transit over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> hairs, and also the degrees and minutes upon the arch AB, cut by the index at each transit; then in the difference of the arches, the difference of the declinations, and by the difference of the times, we have the difference of the right ascensions of the stars.\n\nThe dimensions of this instrument are these: The length of the telescope, or the radius of the sector, is 2\u00bd feet; the breadth of the radius, near the end C, is 1\u00bd inch; and at the end D two inches. The breadth of the limb AB is 1\u00bd inch; and its length fix inches, containing ten degrees divided into quarters, and numbered from either end to the other. The telescope carries a nonius or subdividing plate, whose length, being equal to fifteen quarters of a degree, is divided into fifteen equal parts; which, in effect, divides the limb into minutes, and, by elimination, into smaller parts. The length of the square axis HIF is eighteen inches, and of the part HI twelve inches; and its thickness is about a quarter of an inch: the diameters of the circles are each five inches: the thickness of the plates, and the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, may be taken at the direction of a workman.\n\nThis instrument may be rectified, for making observations, in this manner: By placing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERSECTION\">intersection</a> of the cross hairs at the same distance from the plane of the sector, as the centre of the object-glass, the plane described by the line of sight, during the circular motion of the telescope upon the limb, will be sufficiently true, or free from conical curvity; which may be examined by suspending a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUMB_LINE\">plumb-line</a> at a convenient distance from the instrument; and by fixing the plane of the sector in a vertical position, and then by observing, while the telescope is moved by the screw along the limb, whether the cross hairs appear to move along the plumb-line.\n\nThe axis bfo may be elevated nearly parallel to the axis of the earth, by means of a small common quadrant; and its error may be corrected, by making the line of sight follow the circular motion of any of the circumpolar stars, while the whole instrument is moved about its axis bfo, the telescope being fixed to the limb; for this purpose, let the telescope k be directed to the star a, when it passes over the highest point of its diurnal circle, and let the division cut by the nonius be then noted; then, after twelve hours, when the star comes to the lowest point of its circle, having turned the instrument half round its axis, to bring the telescope into the position m n; if the cross hairs cover the same star supposed at b, the elevation of the axis bfo is exactly right; but if it be necessary to move the telescope into the position u v, in order to point to this star at e, the arch m u, which measures the angle mfu or bfe, will be known; and then the axis bfo must be depressed half the quantity of this given angle if the star passed below b, or must be raised so much higher if above it; and then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> must be repeated till the true elevation of the axis be obtained. By making the like observations upon the same star on each side the pole, in the six-o'clock hour-circle, the error of the axis, toward the east or west, may also be found and corrected, till the cross hairs follow the star quite round the pole; for supposing a o p b c to be an arch of the meridian (or in the second practice of the six-o'clock hour-circle), make the angle afp equal to half the angle afc, and the line f p will point to the pole; and the angle of fp, which is the error of the axis, will be equal to half the angle bfe, or mfu, found by the observation; because the difference of the two angles afb, afc, is double the difference of their halves afp and afp. Unless the star be very\nVI. Transit and Equal Altitude Instruments.\n\n1. The Transit Instrument is used for observing objects as they pass over the meridian. It consists of a telescope fixed at right angles to a horizontal axis; which axis must be so supported that what is called the line of collimation, or line of sight of the telescope, may move in the plane of the meridian. This instrument was first made by the celebrated Mr Romer in the year 1689, and has since received great improvements. It is made of various sizes, and of large dimensions in our great observatories; but the following is one of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> sufficiently large and accurate for all the useful purposes.\n\nThe axis AB (fig. 176), to which the middle of the telescope is fixed, is about 2\u00bd feet long, tapering gradually toward its ends, which terminate in cylinders well turned and smoothed. The telescope CD, which is about four feet and 1\u00bd inch diameter, is connected with the axis by means of a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a> or die G, and in which the two cones MQ forming the axis, are fixed. This cube or stock G serves as the principal part of the whole machine. It not only keeps together the two cones, but holds the two sockets KH, of 15 inches length, for the two telescopic tubes. Each of these sockets has a square base, and is fixed to the cube by four screws. These sockets are cut down in the sides about eight inches, to admit more easily the tube, of the telescope; but when the tube is inserted, it is kept in firm by screwing up the tightening screws at the end of the sockets at K and H. These two sockets are very useful in keeping the telescope in its greatest possible degree of steadiness. They also afford a better opportunity of balancing the telescope and rectifying its vertical thread, than by any other means.\n\nIn order to direct the telescope to the given height that a star would be observed at, there is fixed a semicircle AN on one of the supports, of about 8\u00bd inches diameter, and divided into degrees. The index is fixed on the axis, at the end of which is a vernier, which subdivides the degrees into 12 parts, or five minutes. This index is moveable on the axis, and may be closely applied to the divisions by means of a tightening screw.\n\nTwo upright posts of wood or stone YY, firmly fixed at a proper distance, are to sustain the supports of this instrument. These supports are two thick brass plates RR, having well smoothed angular notches in their upper ends, to receive the cylindrical arms of the axis. Each of these notched plates is contrived to be moveable by a screw, which slides them upon the surfaces of two other plates immovably fixed upon the two upright pillars; one plate moving in a horizontal, and the other in a vertical direction; or, which is more simple, these two modes are sometimes applied only on one side, as at V and P, the horizontal motion by the screw P, and the vertical by the screw V. These two motions serve to adjust the telescope to the planes of the horizon and meridian: to the plane of the horizon by the spirit-level EF, hung by DC on the axis MQ, in a parallel direction; and to the plane of the meridian in the following manner:\n\nObserve by the clock when a circumpolar star seen through this instrument transits both above and below of the pole; and if the times of describing the eastern and western parts of its circuit are equal, the telescope is then in the plane of the meridian: otherwise the screw P must be gently turned that it may move the telescope so much that the time of the star's revolution be bisected by both the upper and lower transits, taking care at the same time that the axis remains perfectly horizontal. When the telescope is thus adjusted, a mark must be set at a considerable distance (the greater the better) in the horizontal direction of the intersection of the cross wires, and in a place where it can be illuminated in the night-time by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LANTERN\">lantern</a> hanging near it; which mark being on a fixed object, will serve at all times afterwards to examine the position of the telescope by, the axis of the instrument being first adjusted by means of the level.\n\nTo adjust the Clock by the Sun's Transit over the Meridian. Note the times by the clock when the preceding and following edges of the sun's limb touch the cross wires. The difference between the middle time and 12 hours, shows how much the mean, or time by the clock, is faster or slower than the apparent or solar time for that day; to which the equation of time being applied, will show the time of mean noon for that day, by which the clock may be adjusted.\n\n2. The Equal Altitude Instrument, is an instrument that is used to observe a celestial object when it has the same altitude on both the east and west sides of the meridian, or in the morning and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a>. It principally consists of a telescope about 30 inches long fixed to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEXTANT\">sextant</a> or semicircular divided arch; the centre of which is fixed to a long vertical axis: but the particulars of this instrument the reader will see explained in Optics.\n\n3. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">Compound</a> Transit Instrument. Some instruments have been contrived to answer both kinds of observations, viz. either a transit or equal altitudes. Fig. 178 represents such an instrument, made first of all for Mr Le Monnier, the French astronomer, by the late Mr Sisson, under the direction of Mr Opaham, mounted and fixed up ready for observation.\n\nAB is a telescope, which may be 3, 4, 5, or 6 feet long, whose cylindrical tube fits exactly into another hollow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> ab, perpendicular to the axis; these several pieces are of the best hammered plate brass. The cylindrical extremity of this axis MN are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>-metal, and wrought exquisitely true, and exactly the same size, in a lathe; and it is on the perfection to which the cylinders or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNNIONS\">trunnions</a> are turned that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUSTNESS\">justness</a> of the instrument depends. In the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> of the object-glass and eye-glass is placed a reticle (fig. 177.), consisting of three horizontal and parallel fine-stretched silver wires, fixed by pins or screws to a brass circle, the middle one passing through its centre, with a fourth vertical wire likewise passing through the centre, exactly perpendicular to the former three.\n\nThe horizontal axis MN (fig. 178.) is placed on a strong brass frame, into the middle of which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> cylinder GH is fixed perpendicularly, being turned truly round, and terminating in a conical point at its lower extremity; where it is let into a small hole drilled in the middle of the dove-tail slider; which slider is\nAppendix.\n\nDescription supported by a hollow tube fixed to the supporting piece IK, consisting of two strong plates of brass, joined together at right angles, to which are fixed two iron cramps L, L\u2081, by which it is fastened to the stone wall of a south window.\n\nThe upper part G of the steel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINDLE\">spindle</a> is embraced by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLAR\">collar</a> d e f, being in contact with the blunt extremity of three screws, whose particular use will be explained by and by. O is another cylindrical collar closely embracing the steel spindle at about a third part of its length from the top; by the means of a small screw it may be loosened or pinched close as occasion requires. From the bottom of this collar proceeds an arm or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a> acted upon by the two screws g h, whereby the whole instrument, excepting the supporting piece, may be moved laterally, so that the telescope may be made to point at a distant mark fixed in the vertical of the meridian. i k is a graduated semicircle of thin brass screwed to the telescope, whereby it may be elevated so as to point to a known celestial object in the daytime. l m is a spirit-level parallel to the axis of rotation on the telescope, on which two trunnions hang by two hooks at M and N. Along the upper side of the glass tube of the level slides a pointer to be set to the end of the air-bubble; and when the position of the axis of rotation is so adjusted by the screws that the air-bubble keeps to the pointer for a whole revolution of the instrument, the spindle GH is certainly perpendicular to the horizon, and then the line of collimation of the telescope describes a circle of equal altitude in the heavens. When the level is suspended on the axis, raise or depress the tube of the level by twisting the neck of the screw u till you bring either end of the air-bubble to rest at any point towards the middle of the tube, to which slide the index; then lift off the level, and, turning the ends of it contrary ways, hang it again on the trunnions; and if the air-bubble rests exactly again, the index as before, the axis of rotation is truly horizontal: If not, depress that end of the axis which lies on the same side of the pointer as the bubble does, by turning the neck of the screw at N, till the bubble returns about halfway towards the pointer; then having moved the pointer to the place where it now rests, invert the ends of the level again, and repeat the same practice till the bubble rests exactly at the pointer in both positions of the level. If, after the telescope is turned upside down, that is, after the trunnions are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a> end for end, you perceive that the same point of a remote fixed object is covered by the vertical wire in the focus of the telescope, that was covered by it before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSION\">inversion</a>, it is certain that the line of sight or collimation is perpendicular to the transverse axis; but if the said vertical wire covers any other point, the brass circle that carries the hairs must be moved by a screw-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KEY\">key</a> introduced through the perforation in the side of the tube at X, till it appears to bisect the line joining these two points as near as you can judge; then, by reverting the axis to its former position, you will find whether the wires be exactly adjusted. N.B. The ball o is a counterpoise to the centre of gravity of the semicircle i k, without which the telescope would not rest in an oblique elevation without being fixed by a screw or some other contrivance.\n\nThe several beforementioned verifications being accomplished, if the telescope be elevated to any angle with the horizon, and there flopped, all fixed stars which pass over the three horizontal wires of the reticle on the eastern side of the meridian in ascending, will have precisely the same altitudes when in descending; they again cross the same respective wires on the west side, and the middle between the times of each respective equal altitude will be the exact moment of the star's culminating or passing the meridian. By the help of a good pendulum-clock, the hour of their true meridional transits will be known, and consequently the difference of right ascension of different stars. Now, since it will be sufficient to observe a star which has north declination two or three hours before and after its passing the meridian, in order to deduce the times of its arrival at that circle; it follows, that having once found the difference of right ascension of two stars about 60 degrees asunder, and you again observe the first of these at the same altitude both in the east and west side, you infer with certainty the moment by the clock at which the second star will be on the meridian that same night; and by this means the transit instrument may be fixed in the true plane of the meridian till the next day; when, by depressing it to some distant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a> objects, a mark may be discovered whereby it may ever after be rectified very readily, so as to take the transits of any of the heavenly bodies to great exactness, whether by night or day.\n\nWhen such a mark is thus found, the telescope being directed carefully to it, must be fixed in that position by pinching fast the end of the arm or lever between the two opposite screws g h; and if at any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> time, whether from the effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> on the wall to which the instrument is fixed, or by any settling of the wall itself, the mark appears no longer well bisected by the vertical wire, the telescope may easily be made to bisect it again, by giving a small motion to the pinching screws.\n\nThe transit instrument is now considered as one of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> particulars of the apparatus of an astronomical observatory.\n\nBesides the above, may be mentioned,\n\nThe Equatorial or Portable Observatory; portable an instrument designed to answer a number of useful observation purposes in practical astronomy, independent of any particular observatory. It may be made use of in any steady room or place, and performs most of the useful problems in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>. The following is a description of one lately invented by Mr Ramsden, from whom it has received the name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> Equatorial.\n\nThe principal parts of this instrument (fig. 179.) are, 1. The azimuth or horizontal circle A, which represents the horizon of the place, and moves on a long axis B, called the vertical axis. 2. The equatorial or hour circle C, representing the equator, placed at right angles to the polar axis D, or the axis of the earth, upon which it moves. 3. The semicircle of declination E, on which the telescope is placed, and moving on the axis of declination, or the axis of motion of the line of collimation F. These circles are measured and divided as in the following table:\n\nMeasures\n### Measures of the several circles and divisions on them.\n\n|               | Radius.

The telescope, which is an achromatic refractor with a triple object-glass, whose focal distance is 17 inches, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a> 2.45 inches, and furnished with six different eye-tubes; so that its magnifying powers extend from 44 to 168. The telescope in this equatorial may be brought parallel to the polar axis, as in the figure, so as to point to the pole star in any part of its diurnal revolution; and thus it has been observed near noon, when the sun has shone very bright.\n\n5. The apparatus for correcting the error in altitude occasioned by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFRACTION\">refraction</a>, which is applied to the eye-end of the telescope, and consists of a slide G moving in a groove or dove-tail, and carrying the several eyetubes of the telescope, on which slide there is an index corresponding to five small divisions engraved on the dove-tail; a very small circle, called the refraction circle H, moveable by a finger-screw at the extremity of the eye-end of the telescope; which circle is divided into half minutes, one entire revolution of it being equal to $3^\\circ 18''$, and by its motion raises the centre of the cross hairs on a circle of altitude; and likewise a quadrant I of $4\\frac{1}{2}$ inch radius, with divisions on each side, one expressing the degree of altitude of the object viewed, and the other expressing the minutes and seconds of error occasioned by refraction, corresponding to that degree of altitude; to this quadrant is joined a small round level K, which is adjusted partly by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PINION\">pinion</a> that turns the whole of this apparatus, and partly by the index of the quadrant; for which purpose the refraction circle is set to the same minute, &c., which the index points to on the limb of the quadrant; and if the minute, &c., given by the quadrant exceed the $3^\\circ 18''$ contained in one entire revolution of the refraction circle, this must be set to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> above one or more of its entire revolutions; then the centre of the cross hairs will appear to be raised on a circle of altitude to the additional height which the error of refraction will occasion at that altitude.\n\nThis instrument stands on three feet L distant from each other 14.4 inches; and when all the parts are horizontal is about 29 inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>: the weight of the equatorial and apparatus is only 59 lb. avoidupoise, which are contained in a mahogany case weighing 58 lb.\n\nThe principal adjustment in this instrument is that of making the line of collimation to describe a portion of an hour-circle in the heavens; in order to which, the azimuth circle must be truly level, the line of collimation or some corresponding line represented by the small brass rod M parallel to it, must be perpendicular to the axis of its own proper motion; and this last axis must be perpendicular to the polar axis; on the brass rod M there is occasionally placed a hanging level N, the use of which will appear in the following adjustments:\n\nThe azimuth circle may be made level by turning the instrument till one of the levels is parallel to an imaginary line joining two of the feet screws; then adjust that level with the two feet screws; turn the circle half round, i.e. $180^\\circ$; and if the bubble be not then right, correct half the error by the screw belonging to the level, and the other half error by the two feet screws; repeat this till the bubble comes right; then turn the circle $90^\\circ$ from the two former positions, and let the bubble right, if it be wrong, by the foot screw at the end of the level; when this is done, adjust the other level by its own screw, and the azimuth circle will be truly level. The hanging level must then be fixed to the brass rod by two hooks of equal length, and made truly parallel to it: for this purpose make the polar axis perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to the horizon; then adjust the level by the pinion of the declination-semicircle; reverse the level, and if it be wrong, correct half the error by a small feeler screw that lies under one end of the level, and the other half error by the pinion of the declination-semicircle; repeat this till the bubble be right in both positions. In order to make the brass rod on which the level is suspended at right angles to the axis of motion of the telescope or line of collimation, make the polar axis horizontal, or nearly so: let the declination-semicircle to $0^\\circ$, turn the hour-circle till the bubble comes right; then turn the declination-circle to $90^\\circ$; adjust the bubble by raising or depressing the polar axis (first by hand till it be nearly right, afterwards tighten with an ivory key the socket which runs on the arch with the polar axis, and then apply the same ivory key to the adjusting screw at the end of the said arch till the bubble comes quite right); then turn the declination-circle to the opposite $90^\\circ$; if the level be not then right, correct half the error by the aforementioned adjusting screw at the end of the arch, and the other half error by the two screws which raise or depress the end of the brass rod. The polar axis remaining nearly horizontal as before, and the declination-semicircle at $0^\\circ$, adjust the bubble by the hour-circle; then turn the declination-semicircle to $90^\\circ$, and adjust the bubble by raising or depressing the polar axis; then turn the hour-circle $12$ hours; and if the bubble be wrong, correct half the error by the polar axis, and the other half error by the two pair of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a> screws at the feet of the two supports on one side of the axis of motion.\nThe Moon in her mean libration\nwith the spots according to Riccioli, Cassini &c.\n\nPlate LXXV.\n\nView of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> Magnitudes of the Planetary Orbits.\n\nOrbit of the Georgium Sidus.\n\nProportional Magnitude of the Primary Planets.\n\nSaturn \u00a7\n\nJupiter \u00b2\n\nGeorgium Sidus\n\nMars \u00b3\n\nEarth \u00f8\n\nVenus \u2079\n\nMercury \u00b2\n\nApparent Magnitude of the Sun seen from each Planet.\n\nFrom Mercury\n\nFrom Venus\n\nFrom Earth\n\nFrom Mars\n\nFrom Jupiter\n\nFrom Saturn\n\nFrom Georgium Sidus\n\nN.B.

The next adjustment is to make the centre of cross hairs remain on the same object, while you turn the eye-tube quite round by the pinion of the refraction apparatus: for this adjustment, let the index on the slide to the first division on the dove-tail; and set the division marked 18\u00b0 on the reduction circle to its index; then look through the telescope, and with the pinion turn the eye-tube quite round; and if the centre of the hairs does not remain on the same spot during that revolution, it must be corrected by the four small screws, two and two at a time (which you will find upon unfreezing the nearest end of the eye-tube that contains the first eye-glass); repeat this correction till the centre of the hairs remains on the spot you are looking at during an entire revolution. In order to make the line of collimation parallel to the brass rod on which the level hangs, set the polar axis horizontal, and the declination-circle to 90\u00b0, adjust the level by the polar axis; look through the telescope on some distant horizontal object, covered by the centre of the cross hairs; then invert the telescope, which is done by turning the hour-circle half round; and if the centre of the cross hairs does not cover the same object as before, correct half the error by the uppermost and lowermost of the four small screws at the eye-end of the large tube of the telescope; this correction will give a second object now covered by the centre of the hairs, which must be adopted instead of the first object; then invert the telescope as before; and if the second object be not covered by the centre of the hairs, correct half the error by the same two screws which were used before: this correction will give a third object, now covered by the centre of the hairs, which must be adopted instead of the second object; repeat this operation till no error remains; then set the hour-circle exactly to 12 hours (the declination-circle remaining at 90\u00b0 as before); and if the centre of the cross hairs does not cover the last object fixed on, set it to that object by the two remaining small screws at the eye-end of the large tube, and then the line of collimation will be parallel to the brass rod. For rectifying the nonius of the declination and equatorial circles, lower the telescope as many degrees, minutes, and seconds, below 0\u00b0 or AE on the declination-semicircle as are equal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEMENT\">complement</a> of the latitude; then elevate the polar axis till the bubble be horizontal, and thus the equatorial circle will be elevated to the colatitude of the place; let this circle be elevated to 6 hours; adjust the level by the pinion of the declination-circle; then turn the equatorial circle exactly 12 hours from the last position; and if the level be not right, correct one-half of the error by the equatorial circle, and the other half by the declination-circle; then turn the equatorial circle back again exactly 12 hours from the last position; and if the level be still wrong, repeat the correction as before till it be right, when turned to either position; that being done, set the nonius of the equatorial circle exactly to 6 hours, and the nonius of the declination-circle exactly to 0\u00b0.\n\nThe principal uses of this equatorial are,\n\n1. To find your meridian by one observation only: for this purpose, elevate the equatorial circle to the colatitude of the place, and set the declination-semicircle to the sun's declination for the day and hour of the day required; then move the azimuth and hour circles both at the same time, either in the same or contrary direction, till you bring the centre of the cross hairs in the telescope exactly to cover the centre of the sun; when that is done, the index of the hour-circle will give the apparent or solar time at the instant of observation; and thus the time is gained, though the sun be at a distance from the meridian; then turn the hour-circle till the index points precisely at 12 o'clock, and lower the telescope to the horizon, in order to observe some point there in the centre of your glass, and that point is your meridian mark found by one observation only; the best time for this operation is three hours before or three hours after 12 at noon.\n\n2. To point the telescope on a star, though not on the meridian, in full daylight. Having elevated the equatorial circle to the co-latitude of the place, and set the declination-semicircle to the star's declination, move the index of the hour-circle till it shall point to the precise time at which the star is then distant from the meridian, found in tables of the right ascension of the stars, and the star will then appear in the glass. Besides these uses peculiar to this instrument, it is also applicable to all the purposes to which the principal astronomical instruments, viz. a transit, a quadrant, and an equal altitude instrument, are applied.\n\nIndians, authenticity of their astronomy, No 370\n\nInstruments, astronomical, first improved in England, description of, p. 171\u2014184.\n\nJosephus mentions the grand year known to

His father, who was a Protestant clergyman, bestowed particular pains upon the earliest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>. After which he went to the university of Montpelier, where he was created <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of arts in the year 1700. He then began the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of medicine; and, in two years, obtained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of bachelor, having upon that occasion written a dissertation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the cause of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a>, which he defended in a very spirited manner. On the 25th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1703 he was created <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> of physic; after which, before arriving at extensive practice he applied to the study of medical authors, both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a>, with uncommon assiduity. The good effects of this study soon appeared; for, in the year 1710, he published a treatise concerning muscular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, from which he acquired very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> reputation. In the year 1717, he was appointed to teach medicine at Montpelier; which he did with such perspicuity and eloquence.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTURIAS\">Asturias</a>, quence, that it was universally said he had been born to be a professor. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> soon rose to such a height, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a> assigned him an annual salary; and he was, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, appointed to superintend the mineral waters in the province of Languedoc. But as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTPELLIER\">Montpellier</a> did not afford sufficient scope for his aspiring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> flock of manuscripts, which he intended to publish, after subjecting them to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the learned. Soon after, however, he left it, having in the year 1729 accepted the office of first physician to the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a>. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> he remained only for a short time, and he again returned to Paris. Upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of the celebrated Geoffroy, in the year 1731, he was appointed regius professor of medicine at Paris. The duties of this office he discharged in such a manner as to answer even the most fangnike expectations. He taught the practice of physic with so great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a>, as to draw from other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> to that of Paris a great concourse of medical students, foreigners as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as natives of France. At the same time he was not more celebrated as a professor than a practitioner. And, even at an advanced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, he persevered with unwearyed assiduity in that intense study which first raised his reputation. Hence it is that he has been enabled to transmit to posterity so many valuable monuments of his medical erudition.

But it is now generally allowed among the learned not to have been his. Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATERLAND\">Waterland</a> attributes it to Hilary bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARLES\">Arles</a>, for the following among other reasons: 1. Because Honoratus of Marcellae, the writer of his life, tells us, that he composed an *Exposition of the Creed*; a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> for the *Athanasian* than that of *Creed* simply which it now bears. 2. Hilary was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> admirer and follower of St Austin; and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of this creed is in a manner upon St Austin's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, both with respect to the Trinity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCARNATION\">incarnation</a>. 3. It is agreeable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of Hilary, as far as we can judge from the little that is left of his works. Upon the whole, he concludes, that Hilary bishop of Arles, about the year 430, composed the *Exposition of Faith*, which now bears the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the *Athanasian Creed*, for the use of the Gallican clergy, and particularly those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a> of Arles: That, about the year 570, it became famous enough to be commended upon; but that all this while, and for several years lower, it had not yet acquired the name of *Athanasian*, but was simply styled *The Catholic Faith*: That, before 670, Athanasius's admired name came in to recommend and adorn it, being in itself an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of the Athanasian principles of the Trinity and incarnation, in opposition chiefly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARIANS\">Arians</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MACEDONIANS\">Macedonians</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-APOLLINARIANS\">Apollinarians</a>. This is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> of the learned author of the *Critical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of the Athanasian Creed*.\n\nAs to the reception of this creed in the Christian Athenasian churches, we find, that it obtained in France in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of Hincmar, or about 852; that it was received in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> about 100 years later than in France, and in Germany much about the same time. As to our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, we have clear and positive proofs of this creed being sung alternately in our churches in the tenth century.

The Persians destroyed it; but it was rebuilt with still greater splendour by the famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERICLES\">Pericles</a>, all of the finest marble, with such skill and strength, that, in spite of the rage of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> and barbarous nations, it remains perhaps the first antiquity in the world, and stands a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of what ancient writers have recorded of the prodigious magnificence of Athens in her flourishing state. 2. The temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEPTUNE\">Neptune</a> and of Minerva; for it was divided into two parts: one sacred to the god, in which was the falt fountain said to have sprung upon the stroke of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRIDENT\">trident</a>; the other to the goddess protectress of Athens, wherein was the sacred olive which she produced, and her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a> which fell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> in the reign of Erichthonius.\n\nAt the back of Minerva's temple was the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>, which was burnt to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> through the knavery of the treasurers, who, having misapplied the revenues of the state, took this short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of making up accounts.\n\nThe lower city comprehended all the buildings surrounding the citadel, the fort Munychia, and the haven Phalerum and Piraeus, the latter of which was joined to the city by walls five miles in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>; that on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> was built by Pericles, but that on the south by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEMISTOCLES\">Themistocles</a>; but by degrees the turrets which were at first erected on those walls were turned into dwelling-houses for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> of the Athenians, whose large city was now become too small for them. The city, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> rather the lower city, had 13 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> gates, with the names of which it is not necessary to trouble the reader. Among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> edifices which adorned it, we may reckon, 1. The temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THESEUS\">Theseus</a>, erected by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONON\">Conon</a>, near its centre. Adjacent thereto, the young people performed their exercises. It was also a sanctuary for distressed persons, slaves or free. 2. The Olympian temple erected in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>, the honour of Athens, and of all Greece. The foundation of it was laid by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PISISTRATUS\">Pisistratus</a>; it was carried on but slowly in succeeding times, 700 years elapsing before it was finished, which happened under the reign of Adrian, who was particularly kind to Athens: this was the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> in which the Athenians beheld <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILLARS\">pillars</a>. 3. The pantheon, dedicated to all the gods; a most noble structure, supported by 120 marble pillars, and having over its great gate two horses carved by Praxiteles: it is yet remaining, as we shall have occasion to show hereafter when we come to speak of the present state of this famous city. In several parts of it were flaoi or porticoes, wherein people walked in rainy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, and from whence a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> of philosophers were denominated flaci, because their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> Zeno taught in those porticoes.\n\nThere were at Athens two places called Ceramicus, from Ceramus the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACCHUS\">Bacchus</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARIADNE\">Ariadne</a>; one within the city, containing a multitude of buildings of all sorts; the other in the suburbs, in which was the academy and other edifices. The gymnasia of Athens were many; but the most remarkable were the Lyceum, Academy, and Cynoargus. The Lyceum stood on the banks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ILISSUS\">Ilissus</a>; some say it was built by Pittiratus, others by Pericles, others by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LYCURGUS\">Lycurgus</a>. Here <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> taught <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, instructing such as came to hear him as they walked, whence his disciples are generally thought to derive the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PERIPATETICS\">peripatetics</a>. The ceramicus without the city was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of six stadia from its walls. The academy made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> thereof; as to the name of which there is some dispute. Some affirm that it was so called from Academus, an ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a>, who, when Helen was stolen by Theseus, discovered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where she lay hid to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CASTOR\">Castor</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLLUX\">Pollux</a>; for which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> the Lacedemonians, when they invaded Attica, always spared this place. Dioclearchus writes, that Castor and Pollux had two Arcadians in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, the one named Echedemonus, the other Marobius; from the former of these he says this place took its name, and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOROUGH\">borough</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARATHON\">Marathon</a> was so called from the other. It was a marily unhealthy place, till Cimon was at great pains to have it drained; and then it became extremely pleas-\nAthens, faint and delightful, being adorned with shady walks, where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> read his lectures, and from thence his scholars were styled academici. The Cynoarge was a place in the suburbs not far from the Lyceum; it was famous on many accounts; but particularly for a noble gymnasion erected there, appointed for the special use of such as were Athenians only by one side. In after times Themistocles derived to himself ill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> with him here, because, being but of the half blood, he could exercise nowhere else but in this gymnasion. Antithenes instituted a sect of philosophers, who from the name of this district, as many think, were styled Cynics.\n\nThe havens of Athens were three. First the Piraeus, which was distant about 35 or 40 stadia from the city, till joined thereto by the long walls beforementioned, after which it became the principal harbour of the city. It had three docks; Cantharos, Aphrodium, and Zea; the first was so called from an ancient hero, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> from the goddess <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENUS\">Venus</a> who had there two temples, and the third from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>-corn. There were in this port five porticoes, which joining together formed one great one called from thence Macra Stoa, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PORTICO\">portico</a>. There were likewise two great markets or fora: one near the long portico, the other near the city. The second port was Munichia, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMONTORY\">promontory</a> not far distant from Piraeus; a place very strong by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and afterwards rendered far stronger by art. It was of this that Epimenides said, if the Athenians foresaw what mischief it would one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> produce to them, they would eat it away with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>. The third was Phalerum, distant from the city, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUCYDIDES\">Thucydides</a> 35 stadia, but according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAUSANIAS\">Pausanias</a> only 20. This was the most ancient harbour of Athens, as Pyreus was the most capacious.\n\nOf this city, as it stands at present, we have the following account by Dr Chandler. \"It is now called Athina; and is not inconsiderable, either in extent or the number of inhabitants. It enjoys a fine temperature, and a serene sky. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is clear and wholesome, though not so delicately soft as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IONIA\">Ionia</a>. The town stands beneath the acropolis or citadel; not encompassing the rock as formerly, but spreading into the plain, chiefly on the west and north-west. Corsairs infesting it, the avenues were secured, and in 1676 the gates were regularly shut after sunset. It is now open again; but several of the gateways remain, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> of Turks patrols at midnight. Some masses of brick-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, standing separate, without the town, belonged perhaps to the ancient wall, of which other traces also appear. The houses are mostly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> and straggling; many with large courts or areas before them. In the lanes, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> walls on each side, which are commonly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>-washed, reflect strongly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the sun. The streets are very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>; and anciently were neither uniform nor handsome. They have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> conveyed in channels from Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-HYMETTUS\">Hymettus</a>, and in the bazar or market-place is a large fountain. The Turks have several mosques and public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a>. The Greeks have convents for men and women; with many churches, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> is regularly performed; and besides these, they have numerous oratories or chapels, some in ruins or consisting of bare walls, frequented only on the anniversaries of the saints to whom they are dedicated. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> of the owner on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> is placed in them on that occasion, and removed when the solemnity of the day is over.\n\n\"The city of Cecrops is now a fortress with a thick irregular wall, standing on the brink of precipices, and Citadel, or enclosing a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AREA\">area</a> about twice as long as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>. City of Cecrops. Some portions of the ancient wall may be discovered on the outside, particularly at the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>; and in many places it is patched with pieces of columns, and with marbles taken from the ruins. A considerable sum had been recently expended on the side next Hymettus, which was finished before we arrived. The scaffolding had been removed to the end toward Pentele; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> was wanting, and the workmen were withdrawn. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARRISON\">garrison</a> consists of a few Turks who reside there with their families, and are called by the Greeks Castriani, or the holders of the castle. The rock is lofty, abrupt, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INACCESSIBLE\">inaccessible</a>, except the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FRONT\">front</a>, which is toward the Piraeus; and on that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> is a mountainous ridge, within cannon-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a>. It is destitute of water fit for drinking; and supplies are daily carried up in earthen jars, on horses and asses, from one of the conduits of the town.\n\n\"The acropolis furnished a very ample <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> to the ancient virtuosi. It was filled with monuments of Athenian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, and exhibited an amazing display of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, of opulence, and of art; each contending as it were for the superiority. It appeared as one entire offering to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>, surpassing in excellence and affluence in richness. Heliodorus, named Periegetes, the guide, had employed on it 15 books. The curiosities of various kinds, with the pictures, statues, and pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>, were so many and so remarkable, as to supply <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLEMO\">Polemo</a> Periegetes with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> for four volumes; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRABO\">Strabo</a> affirms, that as many would be required in treating of other portions of Athens and of Attica. In particular, the number of statues was prodigious. Tiberius Nero, who was fond of images, plundered the acropolis as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DELPHI\">Delphi</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLYMPIA\">Olympia</a>; yet Athens, and each of these places, had not fewer than 3000 remaining in the time of Pliny. Even Pausanias seems here to be disturbed by the multiplicity of his subject. But this banquet, as it were, of the senses has long been withdrawn; and is now become like the tale of a vision. The spectator views with concern the marble ruins intermixed with mean flat-roofed cottages, and extant amid rubbish; the sad memorials of a nobler people; which, however, as visible from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, should have introduced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> Athens to more early notice. They who reported it was only a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a>, must, it has been surmised, have beheld the acropolis through the wrong end of their telescopes.\n\n\"The acropolis has now, as formerly, only one entrance, which fronts the Piraeus. The ascent is by traverses and rude fortifications furnished with cannon, but without carriages, and neglected. By the second gate is the station of the guard, who sits <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>-legged under cover, much at his ease, smoking his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIPE\">pipe</a>, or drinking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COFFEE\">coffee</a>, with his companions about him in like attitudes. Over this gateway is an inscription in large characters on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> turned upside down, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> from the fires made below. It records a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREFECT\">prefect</a> of a pair of gates.\n\n\"Going farther up, you come to the ruins of the Propylaea, an edifice which graced the entrance into the citadel.\"\ncitadel. This was one of the structures of Pericles, who began it when Euthymenes was archon, 435 years before Christ. It was completed in five years, at the expense of 2012 talents. It was of marble, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DORIC\">Doric</a> order, and had five doors to afford an easy passage to the multitudes which resorted on bunsels or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a> to the acropolis.\n\nWhile this fabric was building, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a> Mnesicles, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> equalled his skill, was hurt by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, and the physicians delirious of his life: but Minerva, who was propitious to the undertaking, appeared, it was said, to Pericles, and prescribed a remedy, by which he was speedily and easily cured. It was a plant or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERB\">herb</a> growing round about the acropolis, and called afterwards parthenium.\n\n\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> wing of the propylaea was a temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">Victory</a>. They related that \u00c6g\u00e6us had stood there, viewing the sea, and anxious for the return of his son Theseus, who was gone to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRETE\">Crete</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIBUTARY\">tributary</a> children to be delivered to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINOTAUR\">Minotaur</a>. The vessel which carried them had black sails failing the occasion of its voyage; and it was agreed, that, if Theseus overcame the enemy, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> should be changed to white. The neglect of this signal was fatal to \u00c6g\u00e6us, who, on seeing the sails unaltered, threw himself down headlong from the rock, and perished. The idol was named Victory without wings; it was said, because the news of the success of Theseus did not arrive but with the conqueror. It had a pomegranate in the right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HELMET\">helmet</a> in the left. As the statue was without pinions, it was hoped the goddess would remain for ever on the spot.\n\n\"On the left wing of the propylaea, and fronting the temple of Victory, was a building decorated with paintings by Polygnotus, of which an account is given by Paulanias. This edifice, as well as the temple, was of the Doric order, the columns fluted, and without bases. Both contributed alike to the uniformity and grandeur of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>; and the whole fabric, when finished, was deemed equally magnificent and ornamental. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between Pericles and Paulanias consists of several centuries. The propylaea remained entire in the time of this topographer; and, as will be shown, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> nearly so to a much later <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>. It had then a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> of white marble, which was unsurpassed either in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> or in the beauty of their arrangement; and before each wing was an equestrian statue.\n\n\"The propylaea have ceased to be the entrance of the acropolis. The passage which was between the columns in the centre, is walled up almost to their capitals, and above is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTERY\">battery</a> of cannon. The way now winds before the front of the ancient structure; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> to the left hand among rubbish and mean walls, you come to the back part, and to the five door-ways. The foil without is risen higher than the top of the two smaller. There, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VAULT\">vault</a> and cannon, lies a heap of large stones, the ruin of the roof.\n\n\"The temple of Victory, standing on an abrupt rock, has its back and one side encumbered with the modern ramparts. The columns in the front being walled up, you enter it by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> in the side, within the propylaea. It was used by the Turks as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGAZINE\">magazine</a> for powder, until about the year 1656, when a sudden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a>, occasioned by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>, carried away the roof, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> erected on it, belonging to the officer who commanded in the acropolis, whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, except a girl, perished. The women of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGA\">aga</a> continued to inhabit this quarter, but it is now abandoned and in ruins.\n\n\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CELL\">cell</a> of the temple of Victory, which is of white marble, very thick, and strongly cemented, sufficiently witnesses the great violence it has undergone; the stones in many places being disjointed, as it were, and forced from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> position. Two of these making an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>, the exterior edges touching, without the crevice; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> abroad being much stronger than in the room, which has a modern roof and is dark; the portion in contact becoming pellucid, had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ILLUMINED\">illumined</a> the vacant space with a dim colour resembling that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a>. We were desired to examine this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> appearance, which the Greeks regarded as a standing miracle, and which the Turks, who could not confute them, beheld with equal astonishment. We found in the gape some coals, which had been brought on a bit of earthen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WARE\">ware</a> for the purpose of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCENSE\">incense</a>, as we supposed, and also a piece of wax-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TAPER\">taper</a>, which probably had been lighted in honour of the saint and author of the wonder; but our Swil unfortunately carrying his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> too far in, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> blackened the marble, and destroyed the phenomenon.\n\n\"The building opposite to the temple has served as a foundation for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> lofty tower of ordinary masonry. The columns of the front are walled up, and the entrance is by a low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> gate in the side. It is now used as a place of confinement for delinquents: but in 1676 was a powder-magazine. In the wall of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAMPART\">rampart</a> near it are some fragments of exquisite sculpture, representing the Athenians fighting with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMAZONS\">Amazons</a>. These belong to the frieze, which was then standing. In the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, when Paulanias lived, much of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> was impaired by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, but some remained, and the subjects were chiefly taken from the Trojan story. The traces are since vanished.\n\n\"The pediment of the temple of Victory, with that of the opposite wing, is described as remaining in 1676; but on each building a square tower had been erected. One of the steps in the front of the propylaea was entire, with the four columns, their entablature, and the pediment. The portico, to which the five door-ways belonged, consisted of a large square room, roofed with slabs of marble, which were laid on two great marble beams, and sustained by four beautiful columns. These were Ionic, the proportions of this order best fitting that purpose, as taller than the Doric; the reason it was likewise preferred in the pronaos of the temple of Victory. The roof of the propylaea, after standing above 2000 years, was probably destroyed, with all the pediments, by the Venetians in 1687, when they battered the castle in front, firing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>-hot bullets, and took it, but were compelled to resign it again to the Turks in the following year. The exterior walls, and, in particular, a side of the temple of Victory, retain many marks of their hostilities.\n\n\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> ornament of the acropolis was the parthenon or great temple of Minerva, a most superb and magnificent fabric. The Persians had burned the edifice which before occupied the site, and was called hecatompedon,\nbeatompedou, from its being 100 feet square. The zeal of Pericles and of all the Athenians was exerted in providing a far more ample and glorious residence for their favourite goddesses. The architects were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALLICRATES\">Callicrates</a> and Ictinus; and a treatise on the building was written by the latter and Carpon. It was of white marble, of the Doric order, the columns fluted and without bases, the number in front eight; and adorned with admirable sculpture. The story of the birth of Minerva was carved in the front pediment; and in the back, her contest with Neptune for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. The beasts of burden, which had conveyed up the materials, were regarded as sacred, and repented with pastures; and one, which had voluntarily headed the train, was maintained during life, without labour, at the public expense.\n\nHer statue. \"The statue of Minerva, made for this temple by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHIDIAS\">Phidias</a>, was of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-IVORY\">ivory</a>, 26 cubits or 39 feet high. It was decked with pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> to the amount of 44 talents, so disposed by the advice of Pericles as to be taken off and weighed if required. The goddess was represented standing, with her vestment reaching to her feet. Her helmet had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHINX\">sphinx</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREST\">crest</a>, and on the sides were griffins. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDUSA\">Medusa</a> was on her breastplate. In one hand she held her spear, and in the other supported an image of Victory about four cubits high. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of the Centaurs and Lapithae was carved on her sandals; and on her shield, which lay at her feet, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> of the gods and giants, and the battle of the Athenians and Amazons. By her spear was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SERPENT\">serpent</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLUSION\">allusion</a> to the story of Erichthonius; and on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEDESTAL\">pedestal</a>, the birth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PANDORA\">Pandora</a>. The Sphinx, the Victory, and Serpent, were accounted eminently wonderful. This image was placed in the temple in the first year of the 87th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLYMPIAD\">Olympiad</a>, in which the Peloponnesian war began. The gold was stripped off by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LYCOPHRON\">Lycophron</a>, when Demetrius Poliorcetes compelled him to fly. The same plunderer plucked down the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> shields in the acropolis, and carried away the golden Victories, with the precious vessels and ornaments provided for the Panathenaean festival.\n\n\"The parthenon remained entire for many ages after it was deprived of the goddess. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> converted it into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, and the Mahometans into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSQUE\">mosque</a>. It is mentioned in the letters of Crusius, and miscalled the pantheon and the temple of the unknown God. The Venetians under Konigsmark, when they besieged the acropolis in 1687, threw a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOMB\">bomb</a>, which demolished the roof, and, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> fire to some powder, did much damage to the fabric. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>, which is indented, still witnesses the place of its fall. This was the sad forerunner of farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a>; the Turks breaking the stones, and applying them to the building of a new mosque, which stands within the ruin, or to the repairing their houses and the walls of the fortresses. The vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILE\">pile</a> of ponderous materials, which lay ready, is greatly diminished; and the whole structure will gradually be consumed and disappear.\n\n\"The temple of Minerva in 1676 was, as Wheeler and Spon assert, the finest mosque in the world, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>. The Greeks had adapted the fabric to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONIAL\">ceremonial</a>, by contriving at one end a semicircular recess for the holy tables, with a window; for before it was enlightened only by the door, obscurity being preferred under the heathen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RITUAL\">ritual</a>, except on festivals, when it yielded to splendid illuminations: the reason, it has been surmised, why temples are commonly found simple and unadorned on the inside. In the wall beneath the window were inserted two pieces of the stone called phengiter, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of marble discovered in Cappadocia in the time of Nero; and so transparent that he erected with it a temple to Fortune, which was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> within when the door was shut. These pieces were perforated, and the light which entered was tinged with a reddish or yellowish hue. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of the Panagia or Virgin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, in mosaic, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CEILING\">ceiling</a> of the recess, remained; with two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JASPER\">jasper</a> columns belonging to the screen, which had separated that part from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NAVE\">nave</a>; and within, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANOPY\">canopy</a> supported by four pillars of porphyry, with Corinthian capitals of white marble, under which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> had been placed; and behind it, beneath the window, a marble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol5.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a>; and also a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULPIT\">pulpit</a> standing on four small pillars in the middle aisle. The Turks had white-washed the walls, to obliterate the portraits of saints, and the other paintings, with which the Greeks decorate their places of worship; and had erected a pulpit on the right hand for their imam or reader. The roof was disposed in square compartments; the stones <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASSIVE\">massive</a>; and some had fallen in. It had been sustained in the pronaos by six columns; but the place of one was then supplied by a large pile of rude masonry, the Turks not having been able to fill up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAP\">gap</a> more worthily. The roof of the naos was supported by colonnades ranging with the door, on each side; and consisting of 22 pillars below, and of 23 above. The odd one was over the entrance, which by that disposition was left wide and unembarrassed. In the portico were suspended a few lamps, to be used in the mosque at the seasons when the muezzins assemble before day-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a>, or to be lighted up round the minaret, as is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> during their Ramazan or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENT\">Lent</a>.\n\n\"It is not easy to conceive a more striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> than the parthenon, though now a mere ruin. The co-cent ruin, lamms within the naos have all been removed: but on the floor may be seen the circles which directed the workmen in placing them; and, at the farther end is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a> across it, as for one of the partitions of the cell. The recess erected by the Christians is demolished; and from the rubbish of the ceiling the Turkish boys <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> bits of the mosaic, of different colours, which compose the picture. We were told at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMYRNA\">Smyrna</a>, that this substance had taken a polish, and been set in buckles. This cell is about half demolished; and in the columns which surrounded it is a large gap near the middle. On the walls are some traces of the paintings. Before the portico is a reservoir sunk in the rock, to supply the Turks with water for the purifications customary on entering their mosques. In it, on the left hand, is the rubbish of the pile erected to supply the place of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a>; and on the right, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAIRCASE\">staircase</a>, which leads out on the architrave, and has a marble or two with inscriptions, but worn so as not to be legible. It belonged to the minaret, which has been destroyed.\n\n\"The travellers, to whom we are indebted for an account of the mosque, have likewise given a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>\nThe temple of Minerva Polias was dedicated by all Attica, and possessed the most ancient statue of the goddesses. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMI\">demi</a> or towns had other deities, but their zeal for her suffered no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a>. The image, which they placed in the acropolis, then the city, was in after ages not only reputed consummately holy, but believed to have fallen down from heaven in the reign of Erichthonius. It was guarded by a large serpent, which was regularly served with offerings of honeyed cakes for his food. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> reptile was of great sagacity, and attained to an extraordinary age. He wisely withdrew from the temple when in danger from the Medes; and, it is said, was living in the second century. Before this statue was an owl; and a golden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>. This continued burning day and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>. It was contrived by a curious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol3.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>, named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALLIMACHUS\">Callimachus</a>, and did not require to be replenished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> oftener than once a year. A brazen palm-tree, reaching to the roof, received its lime. Ariftion had let the holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> expire while Sylla besieged him, and was abhorred for his impiety. The original olive-tree, said to have been produced by Minerva, was kept in this temple. When the Medes set fire to the acropolis, it was consumed; but, they asserted, on the following day, was found to have shot up again as much as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CUBIT\">cubit</a>. It grew low and crooked, but was esteemed very holy. The priestess of Minerva was not allowed to eat of the new cheese of Attica; and, among her perquisites, was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of wheat, and one of barley, for every birth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BURIAL\">burial</a>. This temple was again burned when Callias was archon, 24 years after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Pericles. Near it was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a> of Cecrops, and within it Erechtheus was buried.\n\n\"The ruin of the Erechtheum is of white marble; the architectural ornaments of very exquisite workmanship, and uncommonly curious. The columns of the front of the temple of Neptune are flanking with the architrave; and also the screen and portico of Minerva Polias, and with a portion of the cell retaining traces of the partition-wall. The order is Ionic. An edifice revered by ancient Attica, as holy in the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, was in 1676 the dwelling of a Turkish family, and is now deserted and neglected; but many ponderous stones and much rubbish must be removed before the well and trident would appear. The former, at least, might probably be discovered. The portico is used as a powder-magazine; but we obtained permission to dig and examine the outside. The door-way of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VESTIBULE\">vestibule</a> is walled up, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> risen nearly to the top of the door-way of the pandorofeum. By the portico is a battery commanding the town, from which ascends an amusing hum. The Turks fire from it, to give notice of the commencement of Ramazan or of their Lent, and of Bairam or the holy-days, and on other public occasions.\n\n\"The pandorofeum is a small, but very particular building, of which no satisfactory idea can be communicated by description. The entablature is supported by women called Caryatides. Their story is thus related. The Greeks, victorious in the Persian war, jointly destroyed Carya, a city of the Peloponnese, which had favoured the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> enemy. They cut off\nAthens off the males, and carried into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a> the women, whom they compelled to retain their former dress and ornaments, though in a state of servitude. The architects of those times, to perpetuate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, represented them, as in this instance, each with a burden on her head, one hand uplifted to it and the other hanging down by her side. The images were in number six, all looking toward the parthenon. The four in front, with that next to the propylea, remain, but mutilated, and their faces bejeweled with paint. The foil is raised almost to the top of the basement on which they are placed. This temple was open or latticed between the statues; and in it also was a fluted olive-tree, with an altar of Jupiter Herceus standing under it. The propylea are nearly in a line with the space dividing it from the parthenon; which disposition, besides its other effects, occasioned the front and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLANK\">flank</a> of the latter edifice to be seen at once by those who approached it from the entrance of the acropolis.\n\n\"The ruin of the temple of Jupiter Olympus contains gifts of prodigious columns, tall and beautiful, of the Corinthian order, fluted; some single, some supporting the architraves; with a few massive marbles beneath: the remnant of a vast heap, which only many ages could have consumed and reduced into so scanty a compass. The columns are of very extraordinary dimensions, being about five feet in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, and near sixty in height. The number without the cell was 116 or 120. Seventeen were standing in 1676: but a few years before we arrived, one was overturned with much difficulty, and applied to the building a new mosque in the bazaar or market-place. This violence was avenged by the bailiwick of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGROPONT\">Negropont</a>, who made it a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> for extorting from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VASSAL\">vassal</a> or governor fifteen purses; the pillar being, he alleged, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of their master the Grand Signior. It was an angular column, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> in determining the dimensions of the fabric. We regretted that the fall of this mighty mast had not been postponed until we came, as it would have afforded an opportunity of inspecting and measuring some members which we found far too lofty to be attempted. On a piece of the architrave, supported by a couple of columns, are two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> walls, of modern masonry, arched about the middle, and again near the top. You are told it has been the habitation of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERMIT\">hermit</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DOUBLETS\">doublets</a> of a flyte; but for whatever building it has been part, and for whatever purpose designed, it must have been erected thus high in air, while the immense ruin of this huge structure was yet scarcely diminished, and the heap inclined so as to render it accessible. It was remarked that two stones of a step in the front had coalesced at the extremity, so that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a> could be perceived; and the like was discovered also in a step of the parthenon. In both instances it may be attributed to a concretory fluid, which pervades the marble in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARRY\">quarry</a>. Some portion remaining in the pieces, when taken green as it were, and placed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> contact, it exuded and united them by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> similar to that in a bone of an animal when broken and properly set.\n\nBesides the more stable antiquities, many detached pieces of sculpture are found in the town, by the fountains, in the streets, the walls, the houses, and churches. Among these are fragments of sculpture; a marble chair or two, which probably belonged to the gymnasia or theatres; a sun-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DIAL\">dial</a> at the cathedral, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> with the name of the maker; and, at the archiepiscopal house <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> by, a very curious vessel of marble, used as a cistern to receive water, but once serving, it is likely, as public standard or measure. Many columns occur; with some ruined statues; and pedestals, several with inscriptions, and almost buried in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. A custom has prevailed, as at Chios, of fixing in the wall, over the gateways and doors of the houses, carved stones, most of which exhibit the funeral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>. In the courts of the houses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> many round stylobates, or pillars, once placed on the graves of the Athenians; and a great number are still to be seen applied to the same use in the Turkish burying grounds before the acropolis. These generally have concise inscriptions containing the name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>, and of the town and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> to which the deceased belonged. Demetrius the Phalerian, who endeavoured to restrain sepulchral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a>, enacted, that no person should have more than one, and that the height should not exceed three cubits. Another species, which resembles our modern head stones, is sometimes adorned with sculpture, and has an epitaph in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>. We <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> a few mutilated Hermies. These were busts on long quadrangular bases, the heads frequently of bronzes, invented by the Athenians. At first they were made to represent only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HERMES\">Hermes</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a>, and designed as guardians of the sepulchres in which they were lodged; but afterwards the houses, streets, and porticoes of Athens were adorned with them, and rendered venerable by a multitude of portraits of illustrious men and women, of heroes, and of gods: and, it is related, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HIPPARCHUS\">Hipparchus</a>, son of Pothinus, erected them in the demi or borough towns, and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> side, inscribed with moral apophthegms in elegiac verse; thus making them vehicles of instruction.\"\n\nATHERINA.

In the earlier days, their chief food was dry figs and cheese, which was called arida saginatio, \u1f11\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1 \u03c4\u03b5\u1fe6\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, and \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03bd\u03ce\u03c3\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03ac\u03c0\u03b1\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2.

N. Lat. 40\u00b0 10'. The ancients entertained extravagant notions concerning its height. Mela affirmed it to be so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as to reach above the clouds; and Martianus Capellinus, that it was six miles high. It was a received <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that the summit of Mount Athos was above the middle region of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and that it never rained there; because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a> left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the altars erected near its summit were always found as they were left, dry and unscattered. But if on many accounts it was famous among the ancients, it is no less so among the moderns. The Greeks, struck with its singular situation and the venerable appearance of its towering ascent, erected to many churches, monasteries, hermitages, &c., upon it, that it became in a manner inhabited by devotees, and from thence received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the Holy Mountains; which name it still retains, though many of those consecrated works are now decayed. According to the accounts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> travellers, this mountain advances into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHIPELAGO\">Archipelago</a>, being joined to the continent by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISTHMUS\">isthmus</a> about half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> in breadth. It is about 30 miles in circumference, and two in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> height. It may be travelled over in about three days, and may be seen 90 miles off. There is a fine prospect from the top; but, like all other high mountains, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> on its summit is excessive. It abounds with many different kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> and trees, particularly the pine and fir. In the valleys grows a plant called elegia, whose branches serve to make pens for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>. In short, this mountain is said to be adorned with variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERBAGE\">herbage</a> and evergreens, a multitude of springs and streams, and woods growing near the shore, so as to be one of the most agreeable places in the world.\n\nIt is now inhabited by Caloyers, a sort of Greek monks, of the order of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol3.html#article-BASIL\">Basil</a>, who never marry, though others of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> do.

They are about 6000 in all, and inhabit several parts of the mountain, on which are 24 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> old monasteries, surrounded with high walls for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANDITTI\">banditti</a>. They are so respected, that the Turks themselves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> often send them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALMS\">alms</a>. These monks are not idle like others; but labour with the axe, spade, and sickle, dressing themselves like hermits. Formerly they had fine Greek manuscripts; but are now become so illiterate, that they can scarce read <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> write.\n\nThrough this mountain, or rather through the isthmus behind it, Xerxes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a> is said to have cut\nAthwart cut a passage for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> when about to invade <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>.

If the rites of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SCYTHIA\">Scythia</a> were practised on this solemn occasion, a lofty altar, or rather <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILE\">pile</a> of faggots, 300 yards in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> and in breadth, was raised in a spacious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>; and the sword of Mars was placed erect on the summit of this rustic altar, which was annually consecrated by the blood of sheep, horses, and of the hundredth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVE\">captive</a>. Whether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> sacrifices formed any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the worship of Attila, or whether he propitiated the god of war with the victims which he continually offered in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, the favourite of Mars soon acquired a sacred character, which rendered his conquests more easy and more permanent; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARBARIAN\">barbarian</a> princes confessed, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of devotion or flattery, that they could not presume to gaze with a steady eye on the divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a> of the king of the Huns. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Bleda, who reigned over a considerable part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, was compelled to resign his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCEPTRE\">sceptre</a> and his life. Yet even this cruel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> was attributed to a supernatural impulse; and the vigour with which Attila wielded the sword of Mars, convinced the world that it had been reserved alone for his invincible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a>. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of his empire affords the only remaining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> and importance of his victories; and the Scythian monarch, however ignorant of the value of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, might perhaps lament that his illiterate subjects were destitute of the art which could perpetuate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of his exploits.\n\nIf a line of separation were drawn between the civilized and the savage climates of the globe; between the inhabitants of cities who cultivated the earth and the hunters and shepherds who dwelt in tents; Attila might aspire to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of supreme and sole monarch of the Barbarians. He alone, among the conquerors of ancient and modern times, united the two mighty kingdoms of Germany and Scythia; and those vague appellations, when they are applied to his reign, may be understood with an extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THURINGIA\">Thuringia</a>, which stretched beyond its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> limits as far as the Danube, was in the number of his provinces; he interposed, with the weight of a powerful neighbour, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> affairs of the Franks; and one of his lieutenants chastified, and almost exterminated, the Burgundians of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a>. He subdued the islands of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>, the kingdoms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCANDINAVIA\">Scandinavia</a>, encompassed and divided by the waters of the Baltic; and the Huns might derive a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUTE\">tribute</a> of furs from that northern region, which has been protected from all other conquerors by the severity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, and the courage of the natives. Towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a>, it is difficult to circumscribe the dominion of Attila over the Scythian deserts; yet we may be assured, that he reigned on the banks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOLGA\">Volga</a>; that the king of the Huns was dreaded, not only as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a>, but as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGICIAN\">magician</a>; that he insulted and vanquished the khan of the formidable Geogouen; and that he sent ambassadors to negotiate an equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with the empire of China. In the proud review of the nations who acknowledged the sovereignty of Attila, and who never entertained during his lifetime the thought of a revolt, the Gepidae and the Ostrogoths were distinguished by their numbers, their bravery, and the personal merit of their chiefs. The renowned Ardaric king of the Gepidae, was the faithful and sagacious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNSELLOR\">counsellor</a> of the monarch; who esteemed his intrepid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, whilst he loved the mild and discreet virtues of the noble Walamir king of the Ostrogoths. The crowd of the vulgar kings, the leaders of so many martial tribes, who served under the standard of Attila, were ranged in the submissive order of guards and domestics round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> of their master. They watched his nod; they trembled at his frown; and at the first signal of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, they executed without murmur or hesitation his stern and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> commands. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of peace, the dependent princes, with their national troops, attended the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> succession; but when Attila collected his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> force, he was able to bring into the field an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of five, or, according to another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>, of seven hundred thousand Barbarians.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Attila was attended with singular circumstances. He had married a new wife, a beautiful virgin named Ildico. His nuptials were celebrated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> festivity, at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> beyond the Danube, and he retired late to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BED\">bed</a> opprest with wine. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, a blood-veinl burst in his lungs, which suffocated him. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRIDE\">bride</a> was found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> lying by the bedside, lamenting his death and her own danger. The body of Attila was exposed in the plain, while the Huns, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SINGING\">singing</a> funeral songs to his praise, marched round it in martial order. The body, enclosed in three coffins, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, silver, and iron, was privately interred during the night; and to prevent the violation of his remains by the discovery of the place where he was buried, all the captive slaves who were employed in the solemnity were barbarously massacred. This happened about the year 453. With Attila ended the empire of the Huns. His sons, by dissension and civil war, mutually destroyed each other, or were dispossessed by more powerful and independent chieftains.\n\nFor a farther account of his exploits, see the article Huns.","sp":306,"ep":307},{"h":"ATKINS","t":"Sir Robert, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARON\">baron</a> of the exchequer, was born in 1621, and educated at the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, from whence he removed to the inns of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, and became eminent in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>.

The most distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of this island we have in Plato's Timaeus, of which Mr Chambers gives the following abridgement. \"The Atlantis was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> island in the western <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>, situated before or opposite to the straits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GADES\">Gades</a>. Out of this island there was an easy passage into some others, which lay near a large continent exceeding in bigness all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEPTUNE\">Neptune</a> settled in this island (from whose son <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATLAS\">Atlas</a> its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> was derived), and divided it among his ten sons. To the youngest fell the extremity of the island, called Gadir, which in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> signifies fertile, or abundant in sheep. The descendants of Neptune reigned here from father to son for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of generations in the order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMOGENITURE\">primogeniture</a>, during the space of 9000 years. They also possessed several other islands; and, passing into Europe and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, subdued all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBYA\">Libya</a> as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, and all Europe to Asia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a>. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> the island sunk under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; and for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> afterwards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> thereabouts was full of rocks and shelves.\"\n\nMany of the moderns also are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that the existence of the Atlantis is not to be looked upon as entirely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol8.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a>. Some take it to have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>; and from thence, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as from a passage in Seneca's Medea, and some other obscure hints, they imagine that the new world was not unknown to the ancients. But allowing this to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the above-mentioned\nmentioned continent, which was said to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> beyond Atlantis, would seem rather to have been the continent of America than Atlantis itself. The learned Rudbeck, professor in the university of Upsal, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> entitled Atlantica five Manheim, endeavours to prove that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a> are the Atlantis of the ancients; but this its situation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> by no means allow us to believe.

From his taking observations of the stars from a mountain, the poets feigned him to have been turned into a mountain, and to sustain the heavens <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> his shoulders. Being an excellent astronomer, and the first who taught the doctrine of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a>, they tell us that his daughters were turned into stars: seven of them forming the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEIADES\">Pleiades</a>, and other seven the Hyades.\n\nAtlas, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of mountains in Africa, lying between the 20th and 25th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>, and supposed almost to divide the continent from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> to west. They are said to have derived their name from Atlas, king of Mauritania, who was a great astronomer. They are greatly celebrated by the ancients on account of their height, insomuch that the above-mentioned king, who is said to have been transformed into a mountain, was feigned to bear up the heavens on his shoulders. We are assured, however, by Dr Shaw, that the part of this chain of mountains which fell under his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> could not stand in competition either with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol3.html#article-APENNINES\">Apennines</a>. He tells us, that if we conceive a number of hills, usually of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> height of 400, 500, or 600 yards, with an easy ascent, and several groves of fruit or forest trees, rising up in a succession of ranges above one another; and that if to this prospect we add now and then a rocky precipice, and on the summit of each imagine a miserable mud-walled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a>; we shall then have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> idea of the mountains of Atlas.\n\nAccording to M. Chenier*, this mountain is formed by an endless chain of lofty eminences, divided into different countries, inhabited by a multitude of tribes, whose ferocity permits no stranger to approach. \"I have not been able (continues he) to obtain a sufficient knowledge of these mountains to describe them accurately: What Leo Africanus has said of them is very vague; and his account is the less to be regarded at present, as it is now about three centuries since he wrote, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the country has been in that time totally changed.

According to the reports of the Moors, there are many quarries of marble, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a>, and other valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, in these mountains: It is probable there are also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>, but the inhabitants have no idea of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>; they consider their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, which their situation enables them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a>, as the most invaluable of all treasures.\"\n\nAtlas, in Matters of Literature, denotes a book of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a>, containing maps of all the known parts of the world.\n\nAtlas, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">Commerce</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>-fatin, manufactured in the East Indies. There are some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, some striped, and some flowered, the flowers of which are either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> or only silk. There are atlas of all colours, but most of them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a>, especially the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> and the crimson. The manufacture of them is admirable; the gold and silk being worked together after such a manner as no workman in Europe can imitate; yet they are very far from having that fine gloss and lustre which the French know how to give to their silk stuffs. In the Chinese manufactures of this sort, they gild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on one side with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>-gold; then cut it in long slips, and weave it into their silks; which makes them, with very little cost, look very rich and fine. The same long slips are twisted or turned about silk threads, so artificially, as to look finer than gold thread, though it be of no greater value.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">Atmosphere</a>, a word generally used to signify the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of fluid consisting of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, aqueous and other vapours, electric fluid, &c., surrounding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> to a considerable height.\n\nThe composition of that part of our atmosphere properly called air, was till lately very much unknown. In former times it was supposed to be a simple, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMOGENEOUS\">homogeneous</a>, and elementary fluid. The experiments of Dr Priestley discovered, that the purest kind of air, which he called deplogisticated, was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a>, and might be artificially produced in various ways. His first conjectures concerning its component parts were, that it consisted of earth, nitrous acid, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHLOGISTON\">phlogiston</a>. Subsequent experiments rendered these conjectures dubious; and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> it was supposed that deplogisticated air is a pure elementary substance, the vivifying principle to animals, and the acidifying principle throughout all nature. This deplogisticated air, however, is but a small part of the composition of our atmosphere. According to the most accurate computations, the air we usually breathe is composed of only one-fourth of this deplogisticated air, or perhaps less; the other three or four parts consisting of what Dr Priestley calls phlogisticated, and M. Lavoisier respirable air. This by itself is absolutely noxious,\nand exceedingly poisonous to animals: though it seems only to be negatively so; for when mixed in a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> with depoliticated air, it may be breathed with safety, which could not be if it contained any ingredient absolutely unfriendly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>. The other part, viz. the pure depoliticated air, seems to stand much in the same relation to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> that phlogisticated air does to animals; that is, it would prove poisonous and destroy them if they were to depend upon it entirely for their subsistence; but as they derive their nourishment partly from the air and partly from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, it thence happens, that the plants which are set to grow in depoliticated air do not die instantly, as animals do in the phlogisticated kind, but remain for some time weak and sickly.\n\nThe other component parts of our atmosphere are so various, and of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a> natures, that they do not admit of any kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>, one only excepted, namely, the electric fluid. This we know pervades the whole, but appears to be much more copious in the upper than in the lower atmospherical regions. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">Electricity</a>. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of this fluid, either in the atmosphere or any other substance, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>. All that we can know on this subject is, that the electric fluid pervades the atmosphere; that it appears to be more abundant in the superior than the inferior regions; that it seems to be the immediate bond of connection between the atmosphere and the water which is suspended in it; and that by its various operations, the phenomena of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, snow, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>, and various other kinds of meteors, are occasioned.\n\nVarious attempts have been made to ascertain the height to which the atmosphere is extended all round the earth. These commenced soon after it was discovered, by means of the Torricellian tube, that air is a gravitating substance. Thus it also became known, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of air, whose base is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a>, and the height that of the whole atmosphere, weighs 15 pounds; and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of air is to that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>, as 1 to 10,800: whence it follows, that if the weight of the atmosphere be sufficient to raise a column of mercury to the height of 30 inches, the height of the aerial column must be 10,800 times as much, and consequently a little more than five miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>.\n\nIt was not, however, at any time supposed, that this calculation could be just; for as the air is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> fluid, the upper parts must expand to an immense bulk, and thus render the calculation above related exceedingly erroneous. By experiments made in different countries, it has been found, that the spaces which any portion of air takes up, are reciprocally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the weights with which it is compressed. Allowances were therefore to be made in calculating the height of the atmosphere. If we suppose the height of the whole divided into innumerable equal parts, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a> of each of which is as its quantity; and the weight of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> atmosphere being also as its quantity; it is evident, that the weight of the incumbent air is everywhere as the quantity contained in the subjacent part; which makes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the weights of each two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> parts of air. By a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEOREM\">theorem</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, where the differences of magnitudes are geometrically proportional to the magnitudes themselves, these magnitudes are in continual arithmetical proportion; therefore, if, according to the supposition, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> of the air, by the addition of new parts into which it is divided, do continually increase in arithmetical proportion, its density will be diminished, or (which is the same thing, its gravity decreased) in continual geometrical proportion.\n\nIt is now easy, from such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a>, by making two or three barometrical observations, and determining the density of the atmosphere at two or three different stations, to determine its absolute height, or its rarity, at any assignable height. Calculations accordingly were made upon this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>; but it having been found that the barometrical observations by no means corresponded with the density which, by other experiments, the air ought to have had, it was suspected that the upper parts of the atmospherical regions were not subject to the same laws with the lower ones. Philosophers therefore had recourse to another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> for determining the altitude of the atmosphere, viz. by a calculation of the height from which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of the beginning is refracted, so as to become visible to us before the end of twi-bimself is seen in the heavens. By this method it was determined, that at the height of 45 miles the atmosphere had no power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFRACTION\">refraction</a>; and consequently beyond that distance was either a mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a> or the next thing to it, and not to be regarded.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> soon became very generally received, and the height of the atmosphere was spoken of as familiarly as the height of a mountain, and reckoned to be as well ascertained, if not more so, than the heights of most mountains are. Very great objections, however, which have never yet been removed, arise from the appearances of some meteors, like large globes of fire, not unfrequently to be seen at vast heights above the earth (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEOR\">Meteor</a>). A very remarkable one of this kind was observed by Dr Halley in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1719, whose altitude he computed to have been between 69 and 73\u00bd English miles; its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> 2800 yards, or upwards of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> and a half; and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> about 350 miles in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>. Others, apparently of the same kind, but whose altitude and velocity were still greater, have been observed; particularly that very remarkable one, August 18th, 1783, whose distance from the earth could not be less than 90 miles, and its diameter not less than the former; at the same time that its velocity was certainly not less than 1000 miles in a minute. Fire-balls, in appearance similar to these, though vastly inferior in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, have been sometimes observed at the surface of the earth. Of this kind Dr Priestley mentions one seen on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> the Montague, 4th November 1749, which appeared as big as a large millstone, and broke with a violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a>.\n\nFrom analogical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>, it seems very probable, that the meteors which appear at such great heights in the air are not essentially different from those which, like the fire-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> just mentioned, are met with on the surface of the earth. The perplexing circumstances with regard to the former are, that at the great heights above mentioned, the atmosphere ought not to have any density sufficient to support <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>, or to propagate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>; yet these meteors are commonly succeeded by one or more explosions, nay are sometimes said to be accompanied with a hissing noise as they pass over our heads. The meteor of 1719 was not\nonly very bright, insomuch that for a short space it turned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, but was attended with an explosion heard over all the island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, occasioning a violent concussion in the atmosphere, and seeming to shake the earth itself. That of 1783 also, though much higher than the former, was succeeded by explosions; and, according to the testimony of several people, a hissing noise was heard as it passed. Dr Halley acknowledged that he was unable to reconcile these circumstances with the received theory of the height of the atmosphere; as, in the regions in which this meteor moved, the air ought to have been 300,000 times more rare than what we breathe, and the next thing to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> vacuum.\n\nIn the meteor of 1783, the difficulty is still greater, as it appears to have been 20 miles farther up in the air. Dr Halley offers a conjecture, indeed, that the vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> of such bodies might compensate for the thinness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> in which they moved. Whether or not this was the case cannot indeed be ascertained, as we have so few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> to go upon; but the greatest difficulty is to account for the brightness of the light. Appearances of this kind are indeed with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> attributed to electricity, but the difficulty is not thus removed. Though the electrical fire pervades with great ease the vacuum of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> air-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>, yet it does not in that case appear in bright well-defined sparks, as in the open air, but rather in long streams resembling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AURORA_BOREALIS\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA\">aurora</a> borealis. From some late experiments, indeed, Mr Morgan concludes, that the electrical fluid cannot penetrate a perfect vacuum*. If this is the case, it shows that the regions we speak of are not such a perfect vacuum as can be artificially made; but whether it is or not, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> brightness of the light shows that a fluid was present in those regions, capable of confining and condensing the electric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> as much as the air does at the surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>; for the brightness of these meteors, considering their distance, cannot be supposed inferior to that of the brightest flashes of lightning.\n\nThis being the case, it appears reasonable to conclude, that what is called the density of the air does not altogether keep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PACE\">pace</a> with its gravity. The latter indeed must in a great measure be affected by the vapours, but above all by the quantity of the basis of fixed or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPHLOGISTICATED\">dephlogisticated</a> air contained in it: for Mr Kirwan has discovered that the basis of fixed air, when deprived of its elastic principle, is not greatly inferior to gold in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> gravity; and we cannot suppose that dephlogisticated air to be much less. It is possible, therefore, that pure air, could it be deprived of all the water it contains, might have very little gravity; and as there is great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to believe that the basis of dephlogisticated air is only one of the constituent parts of water we see an evident reason why the air ought to become lighter, and likewise less fit for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPULSION\">repulsion</a>, the higher up we go, though there is a possibility that its density, or power of supporting flame, may continue unaltered.\n\nThere are not yet, however, a sufficient number of facts to enable us to determine this question; though such as have been discovered seem rather to favour the above conjecture. Dr Boerhaave was of opinion that the gravity of the air depended entirely on the water it contained; and, by the means of alkaline salts, he was enabled to extract as much water from a quantity of air as was very nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to its weight. By the calcination of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> we may extract as much of the basis of dephlogisticated air from a quantity of atmospheric air as is equivalent to the weight of air lost. Were it possible, therefore, to extract the whole of this, as well as all other vapours, and to preserve only the elastic principle, it is highly probable that its gravity would entirely cease. It has been found by those who have ascended with aerostatic machines, or to the tops of high mountains, that the dephlogisticated air is found to be contained in smaller quantities in the atmosphere of those elevated regions than on the lower grounds. It is also found, that in such situations the air is much drier, and parts with water with much more difficulty, than on the ordinary surface. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">Salt</a> of tartar, for instance, which at the foot of a mountain will very soon run into a liquid, remains for a long time exposed to the air on the top of it, without showing the least tendency to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DELIQUESCENCE\">deliquescence</a>. Nevertheless, it hath never been observed that fires did not burn as intensely on the tops of the highest mountains as on the plains. The matter indeed was put to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> in the great eruption of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VESUVIUS\">Vesuvius</a> in 1779, where, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LAVA\">lava</a> spouted up to the height of three miles above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the sea, the uppermost parts all the while were to appearance as much inflamed as the lowest.\n\nThe high degree of electricity, always existing in the upper regions of the atmosphere, must of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> have a very considerable influence on the gravity of any regions of heterogeneous particles floating in it. When we consider the effects of the electric fluid upon light bodies suspended at the surface of the earth, it will readily be admitted, that in those regions where this fluid is very abundant, electricity, the gravity of the atmosphere may be much diminished without affecting its density. We know that it is the nature of any electrified substance to attract light bodies; and that, by proper management, they may even be suspended in the air, without either moving up or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> for a considerable time. If this is the case with light terrestrial bodies, it cannot be thought very improbable that the aerial particles themselves, i.e., those which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> the basis of dephlogisticated air, and of aqueous or other vapour diffused among them, should be thus affected in the regions where electricity is so abundant. From this cause, therefore, also the gravity of the atmosphere may be affected without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> at all being made in its density; and hence may arise anomalies in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a> hitherto not taken notice of.\n\nIt appears, therefore, that the absolute height of the atmosphere is not yet determined. The beginning height of and ending of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TWILIGHT\">twilight</a> indeed show, that the height of the atmosphere begins to refract the sun's light is about 44 or 45 English miles. But this may not improbably be only the height to which the aqueous vapours are carried: for it cannot be thought any unreasonable supposition, that light is refracted only by means of the aqueous vapour contained in the atmosphere; and that where this ceases, it is still capable of supporting the electric fire at least, as bright and strong as at the surface. That it does extend much higher, is evident from the meteors already mentioned: for all these are undoubtedly carried along with the atmosphere;\nIt has already been mentioned, that the pressure of the atmosphere, when in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> state, is equivalent to a weight of 15 pounds on every square inch. Hence Dr Cotes computed, that the pressure of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBIENT\">ambient</a> fluid upon the earth's surface is equivalent to that of a globe of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> 62 miles in diameter. Hence also it appears, that the pressure upon a human body must be very considerable; for as every square inch of surface sustains a pressure of 15 pounds, every square foot, as containing 144 inches, must sustain a pressure of 2163; and if we suppose a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s body to contain 15 square feet of surface, which is pretty near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, he must sustain a weight of 32,400 pounds, or 16 tons, for his ordinary load. By this enormous pressure we should undoubtedly be crushed in a moment, were not all parts of our bodies filled either with air or some other elastic fluid, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> of which is just sufficient to counterbalance the weight of the atmosphere. But whatever this fluid may be, we are sure that it is just able to counteract the atmospheric gravity and no more; for any considerable pressure be superadded to that of the air, as by going into deep water, or the like, it is always severely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a>, let it be ever so equable. If the pressure of the atmosphere is taken off from any part of the human body, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, for instance, when put in an open receiver from whence the air is afterwards extracted, the weight of the atmosphere then discovers itself, and we imagine the hand strongly sucked down into the glass. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PNEUMATICS\">PNEUMATICS</a>.\n\nIn countries at some distance from the equator, the pressure of the atmosphere varies considerably, and thus produces considerable changes on many terrestrial bodies. On the human body the quantity of pressure sometimes varies near a whole ton; and when it is thus so much diminished, most people find something of a little uneasiness and inactivity about them. It is surprising, however, that the spring of the internal fluid, already mentioned, which acts as a counterpoise to the atmospheric gravity, should in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> seem to keep pace with it when the pressure is naturally diminished, and even when it is artificially augmented, though not when the pressure is artificially diminished. Thus in that kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> when the pressure of the air is least, we never perceive our veins to swell, or are sensible of any inward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> in our bodies. On the contrary, the circulation is languid, and we seem rather to be oppressed by a weight. Even in going up to the tops of mountains, where the pressure of the atmosphere is diminished more than three times what it usually is on the plain, no such appearances are observed. Some travellers indeed have affirmed, that on the tops of very high mountains, the air is so light as to occasion a great difficulty of respiration, and even violent retching and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOMITING\">vomiting</a> of blood. It does not appear, however, that these assertions are well founded. Mr Brydone found no inconvenience of this kind on the top of Mount Etna; nor is any such thing mentioned by Mr Houel, who also ascended this mountain. Sir William <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a> indeed says, that he did feel a difficulty of respiration, independent of any ful-\n\nphurous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>. But, on the top of a volcano, the respiration may be affected by so many different causes, that it is perhaps impossible to assign the true one. The French mathematicians, when on the top of a very high peak of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANDES\">Andes</a>, did not make any complaint of this kind, though they lived there for some time. On the contrary, they found the wind so extremely violent, that they were scarce able to withstand its force; which seems an argument for at least equal density of the atmosphere in the superior as in the inferior regions. Dr Heberden, who ascended to the top of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TENERIFFE\">Teneriffe</a>, a higher mountain than Etna, makes no mention of any difficulty of respiration. M. Sauflaire, however, in his journey to the top of Mount Blanc, the fairest summit of the Alps, felt very great uneasiness in this top of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>. His respiration was not only extremely difficult, but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> became quick, and he was seized with all the symptoms of a fever. His strength was almost exhausted to such a degree, that he seemed to require four times as long a space to perform some experiments on the top of the mountain as he would have done at the foot of it. It must be observed, however, that these symptoms did not begin to appear till he had ascended two miles and a half perpendicular above the level of the sea. The mountain is only about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of a mile higher; and in this short space he was reduced to the situation just mentioned. But it is improbable that so small a difference, even at the end of his journey, should have produced such violent effects, had not some other cause concurred. A cause of this kind he himself mentions, viz. that the atmosphere at the top of the mountain was so much impregnated with fixed air, that lime-water exposed to it, quickly became covered with a pellicle occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> of that fluid. Now it is known that fixed air is extremely pernicious to animals, and would bring on symptoms similar to those above mentioned. There is no reason, therefore, to have recourse to the rarity of the atmosphere for solving a phenomenon which may more naturally be accounted for otherwise.\n\nWhen the pressure of the atmosphere is augmented, by descending, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVING\">diving</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>, to considerable depths in the sea, it does not appear that any inconvenience follows from its increase. Those who sit in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol8.html#article-DIVING_BELL\">diving-bell</a> are not sensible of any pressure as long as they remain in the air, though they feel it very sensibly in going into the water: yet it is certain, that the pressure in both cases is the same: for the whole pressure of the atmosphere, as well as of the water, is sustained by the air in the diving-bell, and consequently communicated to those who sit in it.\n\nBut though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> compression of the air, as well as natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a>, can thus be borne, it is otherwise with artificial rarefaction. Animals in an air-pump show uneasiness from the very first, and cannot live for any time in an atmosphere rarefied artificially even as much as it appeared to be from the barometer on the top of Mount Blanc.\n\nIt is not easy to assign the true reason of the variations of gravity in the atmosphere. Certain it is, however, that they take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> only in a very small degree within the tropics; and seem there to depend on the increased <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the sun, as the barometer constantly sinks near for half an inch every day, and rises again to its former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a>.\nflation in the night time. In the temperate zones the barometer ranges from 28 to near 31 inches, by its various altitudes showing the changes that are about to take place in the weather. If we could know, therefore, the latent causes by which the weather is influenced, we should likewise certainly know those by which the gravity of the atmosphere is affected. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> they may be reduced to two, viz. an emission of latent heat from the vapour contained in the atmosphere, or of electric fluid from the flame, or from the earth. To one or both of these causes, therefore, may we ascribe the variations of the gravity of the atmosphere; and we see that they both tend to produce the same effect with the solar heat in the tropical climates, viz. to rarefy the air, by mixing with it or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> loose a non-gravitating fluid, which did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in such large proportion in any particular place before. No doubt, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the latent heat and electric fluid is the same in the torrid as in the temperate zones; but in the torrid zone the solar heat and excessive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> counteract them; so that whatever quantities may be discharged by the excessive deluges of rain, &c., which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> in those countries, they are instantly absorbed by the abundant fluid, and are quickly ready to be discharged again; while, in the temperate zones, the air becomes sensibly lighter, as well as warmer, by them for some time before they can be absorbed again.\n\nThe variations of heat and cold to which the atmosphere is subject, have been the subject of much speculation. In general they seem to depend entirely upon the light of the sun reflected into the atmosphere from the earth; and where this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFLECTION\">deflection</a> is deficient, even though the light should be present ever so much, the most violent degrees of cold are found to take place. Hence, on the tops of mountains, the cold is generally excessive, though by reason of the clearness of the atmosphere the light of the sun falls upon them in greater quantity than it can do on an equal space on the plain. In long winding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> also, such as the caverns of Etna and Vesuvius, where the air has room to circulate freely, without any access of the sun, the cold is scarce tolerable; whence the use of these for cooling liquors, preserving meat, &c.\n\nThe coldness of the atmosphere on the tops of mountains has been ascribed by M. Lambert and De Luc, to the igneous fluid, or elementary fire, being more rare in those elevated situations than on the plains. M. Lambert is of opinion that it is rarefied above by the action of the air, and that below it is condensed by its own proper weight. He considers fire as a fluid in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, the parts of which are separable, and which is rarefied when its velocity is accelerated. He does not decide with regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDENTITY\">identity</a> of fire and light, though he seems inclined to believe it. M. de Luc compares elementary fire to a continuous fluid, whose parts are condensed by being mutually compressed. He denies that fire and light are the same; and maintains that the latter is incapable, by itself, of setting fire to bodies, though it does so by putting in motion the igneous fluid they contain; and that it acts with more force near the earth than at a distance from its surface, by reason of this fluid, which he calls a heavy and elastic one, being more condensed there than at a greater height.\n\nM. Saufure, in treating of this subject in his account of the Alps, does not consider fire as a fluid free and detached as to be able either to ascend with rapidity by its specific levity, or to condense itself lightly by its proper weight. He supposes it to be united to the bodies by so strict an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a>, that all its motions are determined, or at least powerfully modified, by that affinity. As soon therefore as fire, disengaged by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a> or by any other cause, endeavours to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a> itself, all the bodies that come within the sphere of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> endeavour to attract it; and they absorb such quantities of it as are in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of their affinities with it, or in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSE\">inverse</a> ratio of what is necessary for their equilibrium with the surrounding bodies. Now it does not appear that in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> the situation of places, with regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>, has any other influence than what they receive from the different currents produced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a> of the air, and by the levity which that dilatation produces. The ascent of flame, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>, &c., or of air heated in any way, persuaded the ancients that fire is possessed of absolute levity, by which it had a tendency to mount upwards. \"But these effects (says he) are owing either to the levity of the fluid which constitutes flame, or to that of air diluted by heat; and not to the levity of the igneous fluid. I am, however, sufficiently convinced, that this fluid is incomparably lighter than air, though I do not believe that it possesses the power of ascending in our atmosphere by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of its levity alone.\"\n\nThe celebrated Bouguer has demonstrated, by Mr. Bou's principles the most simple, and most universally adopted, that it is not necessary, in order to account for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of heat on mountains, to have recourse to any of the hypotheses that are at best doubtful. The following Andreae is his explanation of what was felt on the mountains of Peru.\n\n\"It was proper, in order to explain this subject, to insist on the short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of the sun's rays, which cannot strike the different sides of mountains but for a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, and even this not always. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> plain, when the sun is clear, is exposed at mid-day to the perpendicular and undiminished action of these rays, while they fall but obliquely on a plain not much inclined, or on the sides of a high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILE\">pile</a> of steep rocks. But let us conceive for a moment an inflated point, half the height of the atmosphere, at a distance from all mountains, as well as from the clouds which float in the air. The more a medium is transparent, the less heat it ought to receive by the immediate action of the sun. The free passage which a very transparent body allows to the rays of light, shows that its small particles are hardly touched by them. Indeed what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> could they make on it, when they pass through almost without obstruction? Light, when it consists of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> rays, does not by passing through a foot of free atmospheric air, near the earth, lose an hundred thousandth part of its force. From this we may judge how few rays are weakened, or can act on this fluid, in their passage through a stratum of the diameter not of an inch or a line, but of a particle. Yet the subtlety and transparency are still greater at great heights, as was obvious on the Cordilleras, when we looked at distant objects. Lastly, the groser air is heated below by the contact or neighbourhood of bodies of greater density than itself, which it surrounds, and\nand on which it rests; and the heat may be communicated by little and little to a certain distance. The inferior parts of the atmosphere by this means <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> daily a very considerable degree of heat, and may receive it in proportion to its density or bulk. But it is evident that the same thing cannot happen at the distance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> and a half or two leagues above the surface of the earth, although the light there may be something more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>. The air and the wind therefore must at this height be extremely cold, and colder in proportion to the elevation.\n\nBesides, the heat necessary to life is not merely that which we receive every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> from the sun. The momentary degree of this heat corresponds to a very small part of that which all the bodies around us have imbibed, and by which ours is chiefly regulated. The action of the sun only serves to maintain nearly in the same state the sum of the total heat, by repairing through the day the loss it sustains through the night, and at all times. If the addition be greater than the loss, the total heat will increase, as it happens in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, and it will continue to accumulate in a certain degree; but for the reasons already given, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> cannot be very great on the top of a mountain, where the summit, which rises high, is never of great bulk. The lowest state of the thermometer in every place is always in proportion to the heat acquired by the soil; and that being very small on the top of a mountain, the quantity added to it by the sun during the day must be comparatively greater; and the accumulated heat will be more in a condition to receive increase in proportion to its distance from the degree which it cannot pass.\n\nAnother particular observable on all the high places of the Cordilleras, and which depends on the same cause, is, that when we leave the shade, and expose ourselves to the sunlight, we feel a much greater difference than we do here in our fine days when the weather is temperate. Everything contributes at Quito to make the sun exceedingly powerful: a single step from an exposed place to the shade gives the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> of cold; this would not be the case if the quantity of heat acquired by the soil were more considerable. We now also see why the same thermometer, put first into the shade and then in the sun, does not undergo the same changes at all times and in all places. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, upon Pichincha, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> is generally a few degrees below the freezing point, which may be reckoned the natural temperature of the place; but when during the day we expose it to the sun, it is easy to imagine that the effect must be great, and much more than double in whatever way it is measured.\n\nThis theory is adopted by M. Saussure, who adds the following fact to prove that the action of the sun's rays, considered abstractedly and independent of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRINSIC\">extrinsic</a> source of cold, is as great on mountains as on plains; viz. that the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> lenses and mirrors is the same at all heights. To ascertain this fact, our author procured a burning glass to weak that at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENEVA\">Geneva</a> it would just set fire to tinder. This he carried, with some of the same tinder, to the top of the mountain Salve (a height of 3000 feet); where it not only produced the same effect, but apparently with greater facility than on the plain. Being persuaded then, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> source of cold on the tops of high mountains is their being perpetually surrounded with an atmosphere which cannot be much heated either by the rays of the sun on account of its transparency, or by the reflection of them from the earth by reason of its distance, he wished to know, whether the direct solar rays on the top of a high mountain had the same power as on the plain, while the body on which they acted was placed in such a manner as to be unaffected by the surrounding air. For this purpose he instituted a set of experiments, from which he drew the following conclusions, viz. that a difference of 77\u00b0 toises in height, diminishes the heat which the rays of the sun are able to communicate to a body exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> air, 14\u00b0 of the thermometer; that it diminishes the heat of a body partially exposed, only 6\u00b0; and that it augments by 1\u00b0 the heat of a third body completely defended from the air.\n\nHence it appears that the atmosphere, though so essentially necessary to the support of life, is somehow elsewhere ever other the greatest antagonist of heat, and most effectually counteracts the operation of the solar rays in producing it. This power it seems to exert at all distances, at the surface as well as in the higher regions. From some experiments made by M. Picot it appears, that even in places exposed to the rays of the sun, the heat, at five feet distance from the ground, is greater only by one or two degrees than at 50 feet above the surface, though the ground was at that time 15 or 20\u00b0 very near warmer than the air immediately in contact with it. The surface is inconceivable as this difference is, however, it does not hold as we go higher up; for if it did, the cold than at on the top of the mountain of Saleve, which is 3000 feet above the level of the lake of Geneva, would be 62\u00b0 greater than at the foot of it; whereas in reality it is only 10\u00b0. In the night-time the case is reversed; for the stratum of air, at five feet from the ground, was found by M. Picot to be colder than at 50\u00b0. Besides this, different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> of the atmosphere are found to possess very different and variable degrees of cold, without any regard to their situation high up or low down. In the year 1785, Dr Wilson of Glasgow found a very remarkable cold existing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the surface of the ground; so that the thermometer, when laid on the surface of the snow, sunk many degrees lower than one suspended 24 feet above it. It has been likewise observed, that in clear weather, though the surface of the earth be then most liable to be heated by the sun, yet after that is set, and during the night, the air is coldest near the ground, and particularly in the valleys. Experiments on this subject were made for a whole year by Mr James <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEX\">Sex</a>, who has given an account of them in the 7th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Philosophical Transactions. He suspended thermometers constructed in such a manner as to show the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAXIMUM\">maximum</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINIMUM\">minimum</a> of heat that might take place in the observer's absence) in a shady northerly aspect, and at different heights in the open air. One of these was placed at the height of 9 feet, and the other at that of 220 feet above the ground; and the observations were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, with only a few days omission, from July 1784 to July 1785. The greatest variations of heat were in the months of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>; in the former the thermometers generally differed most in the night, and in the latter mostly in the day. From the 25th to the\n28th of October, the heat below, in the night-time, exceeded in a small degree the heat above; at which time there was frequent rain mingled with hail. From the 11th to the 14th, and also on the 31st, there was no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> at all; during which time likewise the weather was rainy; all the rest of the month proving clear, the air below was found colder than that above, sometimes by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> or ten degrees. In the month of June, the greatest variations took place from the 11th to the 15th, and from the 25th to the 30th; and at both these times there appeared to be two currents of wind, the upper from the south-west and the lower from the north-east. Sometimes these were rendered visible by clouds, in different strata, moving in different directions; and sometimes by clouds moving in a contrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> to a very sensible current of air below. On cloudy nights the lowest thermometer sometimes showed the heat to be a degree or two greater than the upper one; but in the daytime the heat below constantly exceeded that above more than in the month of October.\n\nTo determine whether the nocturnal refrigeration was augmented by a nearer approach to the earth, two thermometers were placed in the midst of an open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a>, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of the river near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTERBURY\">Canterbury</a>. One was placed on the ground, and the other only five feet above it. The thermometer, at five feet distance from the ground, agreed nearly with the former at nine feet; but the nocturnal variations were found to correspond entirely with the clearness or the cloudiness of the sky; and though they did not always happen in proportion to their respective altitudes, yet when the thermometers differed in any respect, that on the ground always indicated the greatest degree of cold.\n\nThe difference betwixt these two thermometers, at the small distance of five feet from each other, being found no less than three degrees and a half, the number of thermometers in the meadow was augmented to four. One was sunk in the ground, another placed just upon it, and the third suspended at three feet above it. Three others were placed on a rising ground where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a> was level with the cathedral tower, and about a mile distant from it. One of these was likewise sunk in the ground, another placed just upon it, and a third suspended five feet above it. With these seven thermometers, and the two first mentioned, which were placed in the city, he continued his observations for 20 days; but as the weather happened to be cloudy during the whole of that space, excepting for seven or eight days, no considerable variation happened excepting on these days. The result of the experiments was, that the cold was generally greater in the valley than on the hill; but the variations between the thermometers on the ground and those five feet above them, were often as great on the hill as in the valley.\n\nThus it was perceived that a difference of temperature took place at the distance of only three feet from the ground; but the length of the thermometers hitherto made use of rendered it impossible to make any experiment at a smaller distance. Two new ones, therefore, were formed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> down the large tube, the body or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> of the thermometer, to a horizontal position, while the stem remained in a vertical one; by which method the temperature might be observed to the distance of a single inch. Sometimes, in clear weather, these two horizontal thermometers were placed in the open air, one within an inch of the ground, and the other nine inches above it. When the variation among the other thermometers was considerable, a difference was likewise perceived between these; the lower one sometimes indicating more than two degrees less heat than the upper one, though placed so near each other.\n\nFrom these experiments Mr Sex concludes, that a greater diminution of heat frequently takes place near from the earth in the night-time than at any altitude in these experiments. 220 feet from the ground; and at such times the greatest degrees of cold are always met with nearest the surface of the earth.\n\nThis is a constant and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> operation of nature under certain circumstances and positions of the atmosphere, and takes place at all seasons of the year; and this difference never happens in any considerable degree but when the air is still, and the sky perfectly unclouded. The moistest vapour, as dews and fogs, did not at all impede, but rather promote, the refrigeration. In very severe frosts, when the air frequently deposits a quantity of frozen vapour, it is commonly found greatest; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of heat which in the day-time was found at the lowest station in summer, diminished in winter almost to nothing.\n\nIt has been observed, that a thermometer, included in a receiver, always sinks when the air begins to be win's experiments on any degree of cold thus produced, but from the sudden expansion of the bulb of the thermometer in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the removal of the atmospheric pressure; of air. But from some late experiments related, Phil. Trans., vol. lxxviii. by Mr Darwin, it appears that the atmosphere always becomes warm by compression, and cold by dilatation from a compressed state. These experiments were,\n\n1. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BLAST\">blast</a> from an air-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GUN\">gun</a> was repeatedly thrown upon the bulb of a thermometer, and it uniformly sunk it about two degrees. In making this experiment, the thermometer was firmly fixed against a wall, and the air-gun, after being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a>, was left for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> in its vicinity, that it might previously lose the heat it had acquired in the act of charging; the air was then discharged in a continued stream on the bulb of the thermometer, with the effect already mentioned.\n\n2. A thermometer was fixed in a wooden tube, and so applied to the receiver of an air-gun, that, on discharging the air by means of a screw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PRESSING\">pressing</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VALVE\">valve</a> of the receiver, a continued stream of air, at the very time of its expansion, passed over the bulb of the thermometer. This experiment was four times repeated, and the thermometer uniformly sunk from five to seven degrees. During the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDENSATION\">condensation</a> there was a great difference in the heat, as perceived by the hand, at the two ends of the condensing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYRINGE\">syringe</a>: that next the air-globe was almost painful to the touch; and the globe itself became hotter than could have been expected from its contact with the syringe. \"Add to this (says Mr Darwin), that in exploding an air-gun the stream of air always becomes visible, which is owing\nowing to the cold then produced, precipitating the vapour it contained; and if this stream of air had been previously more condensed, or in greater quantity so as not instantly to acquire heat from the common atmosphere in its vicinity, it would probably have fallen in snow.\n\n3. A thermometer was placed in the receiver of an air-pump, and the air being hastily exhausted, it sunk two or three degrees; but after some minutes regained its former station. The experiment was repeated with a thermometer open at the top, so that the bulb could not be affected by any diminution of the external pressure; but the result was the same. Both during exhaustion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-admission of the air into the receiver, a stream was regularly observed to be condensed on the sides of the glass; which, in both cases, was in a few minutes reabsorbed, and which appeared to be precipitated by being deprived of its heat by the expanded air.\n\n4. A hole, about the size of a crow-quill, was bored into a large air-vessel placed at the commencement of the principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIPE\">pipe</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WATER_WORKS\">water-works</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DERBY\">Derby</a>. There are four pumps worked by a water-wheel, the water of which is first thrown into the lower part of this air-vessel, and rises from thence to a reservoir about 35 or 40 feet above the level; so that the water in this vessel is constantly in a state of compression. Two thermometers were previously suspended on the leaden air-vessel, that they might assume the temperature of it, and as soon as the hole above-mentioned was opened, had their bulbs applied to the stream of air which issued out; the consequence of which was, that the mercury sunk some degrees in each. This sinking of the mercury could not be ascribed to any evaporation of moisture from their surfaces, as it was seen both in exhausting and admitting the air into the exhausted receiver mentioned in the last experiment, that the vapour which it previously contained was deposited during its expansion.\n\n5. There is a curious phenomenon observed in the fountain of Hiero, constructed on a very large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>, in the Chemnitzian mines in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUNGARY\">Hungary</a>. In this machine the air, in a large vessel, is compelled by a column of water 260 feet high: a stop-cock is then opened; and as the air issues with great vehemence, and in consequence of its previous condensation becomes immediately much expanded, the moisture it contains is not only precipitated, as in the exhausted receiver above mentioned, but falls down in a shower of snow, with icicles adhering to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOSE\">nose</a> of the cock. See Phil. Trans. vol. iii.\n\nFrom this phenomenon, as well as the four experiments above related, Mr Darwin thinks \"there is good reason to conclude, that in all circumstances where air is mechanically expanded, it becomes capable of attracting the fluid matter of heat from other bodies in contact with it.\n\n\"Now (continues he), as the vast region of air which surrounds our globe is perpetually moving along its surface, climbing up the sides of mountains, and descending into the valleys; as it passes along, it must be perpetually varying the degree of heat according to the elevation of the country it traverses: for, in rising to the summits of mountains, it becomes expanded, having so much of the pressure of the superincumbent atmosphere taken away; and when thus expanded, it attracts or absorbs heat from the mountains in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTIGUITY\">contiguity</a> with it; and, when it descends into the valleys, and is compressed into less compass, it again gives out the heat it has acquired to the bodies it comes in contact with. The same thing must happen to the higher regions of the atmosphere, which are regions of perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>, as has lately been discovered by the aerial navigators. When large districts of air, from the lower parts of the atmosphere, are raised two or three miles high, they become so much expanded by the great diminution of the pressure over them, and thence become so cold, that hail or snow is produced by the precipitation of the vapour: and as there is, in these high regions of the atmosphere, nothing else for the expanded air to acquire heat from after it has parted with its vapour, the same degree of cold continues, till the air, on descending to the earth, acquires its former state of condensation and of warmth.\n\n\"The Andes, almost under the line, rests its base on burning sands; about its middle height is a most pleasant and temperate climate covering an extensive plain, on which is built the city of Quito; while its forehead is encircled with eternal snow, perhaps coeval with the mountain. Yet, according to the accounts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Ulloa, these three discordant climates seldom encroach much on each other's territories. The hot winds below, if they ascend, become cooled by their expansion; and hence they cannot affect the snow upon the summit; and the cold winds that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWEEP\">sweep</a> the summit, become condensed as they descend, and of temperate warmth before they reach the fertile plains of Quito.\"\n\nNotwithstanding all these explanations, however, several very considerable difficulties remain with regard to the heat and cold of the atmosphere. That warm air should always ascend; and thus, when the source of heat is taken away by the absence of the sun, that the stratum of atmosphere lying immediately next to the earth should be somewhat colder than that which lies a little farther up; is not at all to be wondered at. We have an example somewhat similar to this in the potter's kiln; where, after the vessels have been intensely heated for some time, and the fire is then withdrawn, the cooling always begins at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>, and those which stand lowermost will often be quite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, while all the upper part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a> and the vessels next to it are of a bright red. It doth not, however, appear why such degrees of cold should take place at the surface of the earth as we sometimes meet with. It is, besides, no uncommon thing to meet with large strata in the upper regions of the atmosphere, remarkable for their cold, while others are warmer than those at the surface; as we have been assured of by the testimony of several aerial navigators. It is also difficult to see why the air which has once ascended, and become rarefied to an extreme degree, should afterwards descend among a denser fluid of superior gravity, though indeed the atmospherical currents by which this fluid is continually agitated may have considerable effect in this way. See the article Winds.\n\nFor the quantity of water contained in the atmosphere, see the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> Hygrometer, Clouds, Vapour.\nFor the cause of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a> of the atmosphere, see Elasticity; and for an explanation of its various operations, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEOROLOGY\">Meteorology</a>.\n\nThe uses of the atmosphere are so many and so various that it is impossible to enumerate them. One of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> is its power of giving life to vegetables, and supporting that of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a> beings. For the latter purpose, however, it is not in all places equally proper: we shall therefore conclude this article with some remarks on\n\nThe Salubrity of the Atmosphere.\u2014The air on the tops of mountains is generally more salubrious than that in pits. Dense air indeed is always more proper for respiration than such as is more rare; yet the air on mountains, though much more rare, is more free from phlogistic vapours than that of pits. Hence it has been found, that people can live very well on the tops of mountains where the barometer sinks to 15 or 16 inches. M. de Saussure, in his journey upon the Alps, having observed the air at the foot, on the middle, and on the summits of various mountains, observes, that the air of the very low plains seems to be the least salubrious; that the air of very high mountains is neither very pure, nor upon the whole, seems to fit for the lives of men, as that of a certain height above the level of the sea, which he estimates to be about 200 or 300 toises, that is, about 430 or 650 yards.\n\nDr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">White</a>, in the 68th volume of the Phil. Trans., giving an account of his experiments on air made at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, says, that the atmospheric air was in a very bad state, and indeed in the worst he had ever observed it, the 13th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> 1777; when the barometer stood at 30.32, the thermometer at 69\u00b0; the weather being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALM\">calm</a>, clear, and the air dry and sultry, no rain having fallen for above a fortnight. A slight shock of an earthquake was perceived that day.\n\nThe air of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BED\">bed</a>-room at various times, viz. at night, and in the morning after sleeping in it, has been examined by various persons; and it has been generally found, that after sleeping in it the air is less pure than at any other time. The air of privies, even in calm weather, has not been found to be so much phlogisticated as might have been expected, notwithstanding its disagreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>.\n\nFrom this and other observations, it is thought that the exhalations of human excrements are very little if at all injurious, except when they become putrid, or proceed from a diseased body; in which case they infect the air very quickly.\n\nDr Ingenhouz, soon after he left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, sent an account of his experiments made in the year 1779 upon the purity of the air at sea and other parts; which account was read at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> the 24th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 1780, and inserted in the 70th vol. of the Phil. Trans. His first observations were made on board a vessel in the mouth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a>, between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHEERNESS\">Sheerness</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARGATE\">Margate</a>, where he found that the air was purer than any other sort of common air he had met with before. He found that the sea-air taken farther from the land, viz. between the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OSTEND\">Ostend</a>, was not so pure as that tried before; yet this inferior purity seems not to take place always. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a>'s general observations, deduced from his numerous experiments, are, \"That the air at sea, and close to it, is in general purer, and fitter for animal life, than the air on the land, though it seems to be subject to some inconstancy in its degree of purity with that of the land: That probably the air will be found in general much purer far from the land than near the shore, the former being never subject to be mixed with land air.\"\n\nThe Doctor in the same paper transcribes a journal of experiments, showing the degree of purity of the atmosphere in various places, and under different circumstances; which we shall insert here in an abridged manner.\n\nThe method used in those experiments was to introduce one measure of common air into the endome of the purifier tube, and then one measure of nitrous air. The majority of the experiment that these two sorts of elastic fluids came into contact, he agitated the tube in the water-trough, and then measured the diminution, expressing it by hundredths of a measure; thus, when he says, that such air was found to be 130, it signifies, that after mixing one measure of it with one of nitrous air, the whole mixed and diminished quantity was 130 hundredths of a measure, viz. one measure and 30 hundredths of a measure more.\n\n\"The different degrees of salubrity of the atmosphere, as I found it in general in my country house at Southall-Green, ten miles from London, from June to September, lay between 103 and 109. I was surprised when, upon my return to town to my former lodgings to Pall Mall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">Court</a>, I found the common air purer in general in October than I used to find it in the middle of summer in the country; for on the 22nd of October, at nine o'clock in the morning, the weather being fair and frosty, I found that one measure of common air, and one of nitrous air, occupied 100 subdivisions in the glass-tube, or exactly one measure. That very day, at two o'clock in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a> (it being then rainy weather), the air was somewhat altered for the worse. It gave 102. October the 23rd, it being rainy weather, the air gave 102. October the 24th, the weather being serene, the air at nine o'clock in the morning gave 100. October the 25th, the sky being cloudy at 11 o'clock in the morning, the air gave 102. At 11 o'clock at night, from five different trials, it gave 105. October the 26th, the weather being very dark and rainy, the air gave 105, as before.\"\n\nThe air at Ostend was found by the Doctor to be generally very good, giving between 94 and 98. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRUGES\">Bruges</a>, the air taken at seven o'clock at night gave 103. November the 8th, the air at Ghent at three in the afternoon gave 103.\n\nNovember the 12th, the air of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRUSSELS\">Brussels</a> at seven o'clock P.M. gave 105\u00bd. The next day the air of the lower part of the same city gave 106; that of the highest appeared to be purer, as it gave 104: which agrees with the common popular observation. November the 14th, both the air of the highest and that of the lowest part of the city appeared to be of the same goodness, giving 103. The weather was frosty.\n\nNovember the 22nd, the air of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTWERP\">Antwerp</a> in the evening gave 109\u00bd; the weather being rainy, damp, and cold. November the 23rd, the air of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREDA\">Breda</a> gave 106. The next day about 11 o'clock the air gave 102; the weather being fair, cold, and inclining to frost.\nseven o'clock it gave 103. Next day being the 25th, the air gave 104; the weather being cold and rainy. The 26th it gave 103; the weather being very rainy, cold, and stormy. November the 27th, the air at the Moordyke close to the water gave 101\u00bd; the weather being fair and cold, but not frosty. This spot is reckoned very healthy. November the 28th, the air of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROTTERDAM\">Rotterdam</a> gave 103; the weather being rainy and cold. November the 29th, the air of Delit gave 103; the weather being stormy and rainy.\n\nNovember the 30th, the air of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAGUE\">Hague</a> gave 104; the weather being cold, and the wind northerly. The first of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> the weather underwent a sudden change; the wind becoming foutherly and stormy, and the atmosphere becoming very hot. The day after, Fahrenheit's thermometer stood at 54\u00b0; and the common air being repeatedly and accurately tried gave 116; and that preserved in a glass phial from the preceding day gave 117; and that gathered close to the sea gave 115.\n\nDecember the 4th, the air of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a> gave 103; the weather being rainy, windy, and cold. The day after, the weather continuing nearly the same, the air gave 102. December the 10th, the air of Rotterdam gave 101; the weather being rainy. December the 12th, being in the middle of the water between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DORT\">Dort</a> and the Moordyke, the air gave 109; the weather being remarkably dark, rainy, and windy. December the 13th, the air of Breda in the morning gave 109; the weather continuing as the day before. And in the afternoon, the air gave 106\u00bd; the weather having cleared up. December the 16th, the air of the lower part of the city of Antwerp gave 105; that of the higher part 104; the weather being rainy and temperate. December the 17th, the air of Antwerp gave 107; the weather continuing nearly as in the preceding day. December the 19th, the air of Brussel gave 109; the weather being rainy, windy, and rather warm. December the 21st, the air of Brussel gave 106; the weather being dry and cold. The next day the air and the weather continued the same. December the 23rd, the air of Mons gave 104; the weather being rainy and cold. December the 24th, the air near Bochian gave 104\u00bd; the weather being cloudy and cold. December the 25th, the air of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERONNE\">Peronne</a> gave 102\u00bd; the weather being frosty. December the 26th, the air of Cuvilli gave 103; the weather frosty. December the 27th, the air of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENLIS\">Senlis</a> gave 102\u00bd; the weather frosty. December the 29th, the air of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> gave 103; the weather frosty. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> the 8th, the air of Paris gave 100; the weather frosty. January the 13th, the air of Paris gave 09\u00bd; hard frost.\n\nThus far with Dr Ingenhouz's observations. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> was a very portable one, made by Mr Martin, which in reality is the eudiometer-tube and measure as used by Mr Fontana before he made his last improvement. \"The whole of this apparatus (says Dr Ingenhouz) was packed up in a box about ten inches long, five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> and three and half high. The glass-tube or great measure, which was 16 inches long, and divided into two separate pieces, lay in a small compass, and could be put together by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> screws adapted to the divided extremities. Instead of a water trough, such as is used commonly, I made use of a small round wooden tub,\" &c.\n\nThe Abb\u00e9 Fontana, who has made a great number of pontane's very accurate experiments upon this subject, gives his opinions in the following words: \"I have not the least in the substitution in afflicting, that the experiments made to ascertain the salubrity of the atmospheric air in various places in different countries and situations, mentioned by several authors, are not to be depended upon; because the method they used was far from being exact (a), the elements or ingredients for the experiment were unknown and uncertain, and the results very different from one another.\n\n\"When all the errors are corrected, it will be found that the difference between the air of one country and that of another, at different times, is much less than what is commonly believed: and that the great differences found by various observers are owing to the fallacious effects of uncertain methods. This I advance from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>; for I was in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>. I found very great differences between the results of the experiments of this nature which ought to have been similar; which diversities I attributed to myself, rather than to the method I then used. At Paris I examined the air of different places at the same time, and especially of those situations where it was most probable to meet with infected air, because those places abounded with putrid substances and impure exhalations; but the differences I observed were very small, and much less than what could have been suspected, for they hardly arrived at one fiftieth of the air in the tube. Having taken the air of the hill called Mount Valerion, at the height of about 500 feet above the level of Paris, and compared it with the air of Paris taken at the same time, and treated alike, I found the former to be hardly one-thirtieth better than the latter.\n\n\"In London I have observed almost the same. The air of Islington and that of London suffered an equal diminution by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of nitrous air; yet the air of Islington is esteemed to be much better. I have examined the air of London taken at different heights (for instance, in the street, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>, and at the top of the adjoining houses), and have found it to be of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. Having taken the air at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GALLERY\">gallery</a> of St Paul's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUPOLA\">cupola</a>, at the height of 313 feet above the ground, and likewise the air of the stone gallery, which is 202 feet below the other; and having compared these two quantities of air with that of the street adjoining, I found that there was scarce any sensible difference between them, although taken at such different heights.\n\n\"In this experiment a circumstance is to be considered, which must have contributed to render the above-mentioned differences more sensible: that is, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a> of the air of the cupola; for there was felt a pretty brisk wind upon it, which I observed to be stronger and stronger the higher I ascended; whereas\n\n(a) It is plain that Dr Ingenhouz's method is not implied in this remark; since the Doctor's experiments were made long after, and the method used by him was properly that of Mr Fontana.\nin the street, and indeed in all the streets I passed through, there was no sensible wind to be felt. This experiment was made at four in the afternoon, the weather being clear. The quicksilver in the barometer at that time was 28.6 inches high, and Fahrenheit's thermometer stood at 54\u00b0.\n\nA few lines after, Mr Fontana proceeds thus:\n\n\"From this we clearly see, how little the experiments hitherto published about the differences of common air are to be depended upon. In general, I find that the air changes from one time to another; so that the differences between them are far greater than those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AIRS\">airs</a> of different countries or different heights. For instance, I have found that the air of London in the months of September, October, and November, 1778, when treated with the nitrous air, gave II, I, 1,990, and II, II, 2,25; which is a mean result of many experiments which differed very little from each other. The 26th day of November last, I found the air, for the first time, much better; for it gave II, I, 1,80, and II, II, 2,20; but the 14th of February 1779, the air gave II, I, 1,69 and II, II, 2,21; from whence it appears, that the air of this 14th of February was better than it had been six months before. There can be no doubt of the accuracy of the experiments, because I compared the air taken at different times with that which I had first used in the month of September, and which I had preserved in dry glass-bottles accurately stoppered.\"\n\nThis difference in the purity of the air at different times, Mr Fontana farther remarks, is much greater than the difference between the air of the different places observed by him: notwithstanding this great change, as he observed, and as he was informed by various persons, no particular change of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> in the generality of people, or facility of breathing, was perceived.\n\nMr Fontana lastly concludes with observing, that \"Nature is not so partial as we commonly believe. She has not only given us an air almost equally good everywhere at every time, but has allowed us a certain latitude, or a power of living and being in health in qualities of air which differ to a certain degree. By this I do not mean to deny the existence of certain kinds of noxious air in some particular places; but only say, that in general the air is good everywhere, and that the small differences are not to be feared so much as some people would make us believe. Nor do I mean to speak here of some vapours and other bodies which are accidentally joined to the common air in particular places, but do not change its nature and intrinsical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>. This state of the air cannot be known by the test of nitrous air; and those vapours are to be considered in the same manner as we should consider so many particles of arsenic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a> in the atmosphere.

But on this extensive space not even a shrub grows naturally.\n\nBesides taro, the sweet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-POTATO\">potato</a>, and other similar vegetables used by our crews as refreshments, among which were at least five or six varieties of plantains, the island produces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>-fruit; which, however, seems to be scarce. There are also a few cocoa palms; some yams; the kappe of the Friendly islands, or Virginian arum; the etoona tree, and odoriferous gardenia, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">cape</a>\ncape jasmine. Our people also met with several trees of the dooe dooe, that bear the oily nuts, which are flack upon a kind of skewer and made use of as candles. There is a species of fida, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> mallow; also the morinda citrifolia, which is here called none; a species of convolvulus; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVA\">ava</a> or intoxicating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, besides <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> quantities of gourds. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> grow to a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, and are of a remarkable variety of shapes, which are perhaps the effect of art.\n\nThe scarlet birds, which were brought for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>, were never met with alive; but one small one was seen, about the size of a canary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a>, of a deep crimson <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>; also a large owl, two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> hawks or kites, and a wild duck. Other birds were mentioned by the natives; among which were the otoo, or bluish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HERON\">heron</a>, and the torata, a sort of whimbrel. It is probable that the species of birds are numerous, if we may judge by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, green, and small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELVET\">velvet</a>-like blackish feathers used upon the cloaks and other ornaments worn by these people. Fish, and other productions of the sea, were, to appearance, not various. The only tame or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> animals found here were hogs, dogs, and fowls, which were all of the same kind that had been met with at the islands of the South Pacific. There were also small lizards, and some rats.\n\nThe inhabitants of Atooi are of the middle size, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> stoutly made. They are neither remarkable for a beautiful shape nor for striking features. Their visage, particularly that of the women, is sometimes round, but others have it long; nor can it justly be said, that they are distinguished as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> by any general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> of countenance. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> is nearly of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol15.html#article-NUT\">nut</a>-brown; but some individuals are of a darker hue. They are far from being ugly, and have, to all appearance, few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> deformities of any kind. Their skin is not very soft nor shining; but their eyes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> are, for the most part, pretty good. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> in general is straight; and though its natural colour is usually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, they thin it, as at the Friendly and other islands. They are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>, vigorous, and most expert swimmers; leaving their canoes upon the most frivolous occasion, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVING\">diving</a> under them, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a> to others, though at a considerable distance. Women with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol11.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, when the surf was so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as to prevent their landing in the canoes, frequently leaped overboard, and swam to the shore, frequently endangering their little ones. They appeared to be of a frank, cheerful disposition; and are equally free from the fickle levity which characterizes the inhabitants of Otaheite, and the sedate cast which is observable among many of those of Tongataboo. They seem to cultivate a sociable intercourse with each other; and, except the propensity to thieving, which is as it were innate in most of the people in those seas, they appeared extremely friendly. It was pleasing to observe with what affection the women managed their infants, and with what alacrity the men contributed their assistance in such a tender office; thus distinguishing themselves from those savages who consider a wife and child as things rather necessary than desirable or worthy of their regard and esteem. From the numbers that were seen assembled at every village in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COASTING\">coasting</a> along, it was conjectured that the inhabitants of this island are pretty numerous. Including the straggling hovels, it was computed there might perhaps be, in the whole island, sixty such villages as that near which our ships anchored; and allowing five persons to each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, there would be in every village five hundred, or thirty thousand upon the island. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> is by no means exaggerated; for there were sometimes three thousand people at least collected upon the beach, when it could not be supposed that above a tenth part of the natives were present.","sp":264,"ep":265},{"h":"ATRA BILIS","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">BLACK</a> BILE, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">OR</a> MELANCHOLY.** According to the ancients it hath a twofold origin: 1st, From the groser parts of the blood, and this they called the melancholy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>. 2nd, From <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> bile being highly concocted.

The Atrebati were among those British tribes which submitted to Caesar; nor do we hear of any remarkable resistance they made against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> at their next invasion under Claudius.

And he that brings the attaint can give no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> to the grand jury, than what was originally given to the petit. For as their verdict is now trying, and the question is whether or no they did <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> upon the evidence that appeared to them, the law adjudged it the highest absurdity to produce any subsequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> upon such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, and to condemn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> jurisdiction for not believing evidence which they never knew. But those against whom it is brought are allowed, in the affirmance of the first verdict, to produce new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>: because the petit jury may have formed their verdict upon evidence of their own knowledge, which never appeared in court; and because very terrible was the judgment which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> law inflicted upon them, if the grand jury found their verdict a false one. The judgment was,\n\n1. That they should lose their liberam legem, and become for ever infamous.\n2. That they should forfeit all their goods and chattels.\n3. That their lands and tenements should be seized into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>.\n4. That their wives and children should be thrown out of doors.\n5. That their houses should be rafed and thrown <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>.\n6. That their trees should be rooted up.\n7. That their meadows should be ploughed.\n8. That their bodies should be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> into jail.\n9. That the party should be restored to all that he lost by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> of the unjust verdict. But as the severity of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> had its usual effect, in preventing the law from being executed, therefore by the statute 11 Hen. VII. c. 24, revived by 23 Hen. VIII. c. 3, and made perpetual by 13 Eliz. c. 25, it is allowed to be brought after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of the party, and a more moderate punishment was inflicted upon attainted jurors: viz. perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFAMY\">infamy</a>, and if the cause of action were above 40l. value, a forfeiture of 20l. a-piece by the jurors; or, if under 40l. then 5l. a-piece; to be divided between the king and the party injured. So that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> may now bring an attaint either upon the statute or at common law, at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a>; and in both of them may reverse the former judgment.

The year he was made M.A. 1687, he exerted himself in the controversy with the Papists, vindicated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a> in the strongest manner, and showed an uncommon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> of learning, enlivened with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> vivacity.

The next year <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> him at the top of his preferment, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as of his reputation: for, in the beginning of June 1713, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>, at the recommendation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">Chancellor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARCOURT\">Harcourt</a>, advanced him to the bishopric of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROCHESTER\">Rochester</a>, with the deanery of Westminster in commendam; he was confirmed July 4, and consecrated at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAMBETH\">Lambeth</a> next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>.\n\nAt the beginning of the succeeding reign, his tide of prosperity began to turn; and he received a sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> presently after the coronation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">King</a> George I., when, upon his offering to present his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">Majesty</a> (with a view, no doubt, of standing better in his favour) with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol5.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> of state or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANOPY\">canopy</a>, his own perquisites as dean of Westminster, the offer was rejected, not without some evident marks of dislike to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>.\n\nDuring the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REBELLION\">rebellion</a> in Scotland, when the Pretender's declaration was dispersed, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTERBURY\">Canterbury</a>, and the bishops in or near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, had published a Declaration of their abhorrence of the present Rebellion, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXHORTATION\">Exhortation</a> to the Clergy and People to be zealous in the discharge of their duties to his Majesty King George: but the bishop of Rochester refused to sign it; and engaged Bishop Smalridge in the same refusal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of some reflections it contained against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> church <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTY\">party</a>. He appeared generally among the protestants against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of the ministry under the king, and drew up the reasons of the protest with his own hand.\n\nIn 1716, we find him advising Dean Swift in the management of a refractory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 26, 1722, he sustained a severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> in the loss of his lady; by whom he had four children; Francis, who died an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a>; Osborn, student of Christ church; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, who died <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> 29, 1716, aged 17; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, who had been then seven years married to Mr Maurice.\n\nIn this memorable year, on a suspicion of his being concerned in a plot in favour of the Pretender, he was apprehended August 24, and committed prisoner to the Tower.\n\nTwo officers, the under secretary, and a messenger, went about two o'clock in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a> to the bishop's house at Westminster, where he then was, with orders to bring him and his papers before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>. He happened to be in his nightgown when they came in; and being made acquainted with their business, he desired <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to dress himself. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time his secretary came in; and the officers went to search for his papers; in the sealing of which the messenger brought a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, which he pretended to have found in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>-stool, and desired it might be sealed up with the rest. His Lordship observing it, and believing it to be a forged one of his own, desired the officers not to do it, and to bear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a> that the paper was not found with him. Nevertheless they did it; and though they behaved themselves with some respect to Atterbury, him, they suffered the messengers to treat him in a very rough manner, threatening him, if he did not make haste to dress himself, they would carry him away undressed as he was. Upon which he ordered his secretary to see his papers all sealed up, and went himself directly to the Cock-pit, where the council waited for him. The behaviour of the messengers, upon this occasion, seems to have been very unwarrantable, if what the author of \"A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">Letter</a> to the Clergy of the Church of England,\" &c., tells us be true, that the persons, directed by order of the king and council to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> his lordship and his papers, received a strict command to treat him with great respect and reverence. However this was, when he came before the council, he behaved with a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of calmness, and they with much civility towards him. He had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to speak for himself as much as he pleased, and they listened to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> with a great deal of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>; and, what is more unusual, after he was withdrawn, he had twice liberty to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-enter the council chamber, to make for himself such representations and requests as he thought proper. It is said, that, while he was under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, he made use of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVIOUR\">Saviour</a>'s answer to the Jewish council, while he stood before them; \"If I tell you, ye <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not believe me; and if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.\" After three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>'s stay at the Cock-pit, he was sent to the Tower, privately, in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COACH\">coach</a>, without any manner of noise or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITMENT\">commitment</a> of a bishop upon a suspicion of high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a>, as it was a thing rarely practised since the Reformation, so it occasioned various speculations among the people. Those who were the bishop's friends, and pretended to the greatest intimacy with him, laid the whole odium of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> upon the ministry. They knew the bishop so well, they said, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to the Protestant succession, his professed abhorrence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POPERY\">Popery</a>, and settled contempt of the Pretender, and his caution, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, and circumspection, to be such, as would never allow him to engage in an attempt of subverting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, so hazardous in itself, and so repugnant to his principles; and therefore they imputed all to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALICE\">malice</a> and management of a great minister of state or two, who were resolved to remove him, on account of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> prejudices, as well as the constant molestation he gave them in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, and the particular influence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> he had shown in the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a>. The friends to the ministry, on the other hand, were strongly of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that the bishop was secretly a favourite of the Pretender's cause, and had formerly been tampering with things of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, even in the queen's time, and while his party was excluded from power; but upon their re-admission, had relinquished that pursuit, and his confederates therein, and became a good subject again. They urged, that the influence which the late duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORMOND\">Ormond</a> had over him, assisted by his own private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a>, might prompt him to many things contrary to his declared sentiments, and inconsistent with that cunning and caution which in other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of. And to obviate the difficulty, arising from the bishop's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a> to Popery, and the Pretender's bigotry to that religion, they talked of a new\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 23, 1722-3, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> was brought into the house of commons, for \"inflicting certain pains and penalties on Francis Lord Bishop of Rochester;\" a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of which was sent to him, with notice that he had liberty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNSEL\">counsel</a> and solicitors for making his defence. Under these circumstances the bishop applied, by petition, to the house of lords for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> and advice as to his conduct in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a>; and April 4, he acquainted the speaker of the house of commons, by a letter, that he was determined to give that house no trouble in relation to the bill depending therein; but should be ready to make his defence against it when it should be argued in another house, of which he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to be a member.\n\nOn the 9th the bill passed the house of commons, and was the same day sent up to the house of lords for their concurrence.\n\nMay 6th being the day appointed by the lords for the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> of the bill, Bishop Atterbury was brought to Westminster to make his defence. The counsel for the bishop were, Sir Constantine Phipps and William Wynne, Esq.; for the king, Mr Reeve and Mr Weare. The proceedings <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> above a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>; and on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURDAY\">Saturday</a> May 11th, the bishop was permitted to plead for himself. This he did in a very eloquent speech; which he feelingly opens by complaining of the uncommon severity he had experienced in the Tower; which was carried to so great a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, that not even his son-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> Mr Morice was permitted to speak to him in any nearer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> than standing in an open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AREA\">area</a>, whilst the bishop looked out of a two-pair-of-doors window. In the course of his defence he observes, \"Here is a plot of a year or two standing, to subvert the government with an armed force; an invasion from abroad, an insurrection at home: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> when ripe for execution, it is discovered; and twelve months after the contrivance of this scheme, no consultation appears, no men corresponding together, no provision made, no arms, no officers provided, not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> in arms; and yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> bishop has done all this. What could tempt me to step thus out of my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>? Was it ambition, and a desire of climbing into a higher station in the church? There is not a man in my office farther removed from this than I am. Was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> my aim? I always despised it too much, considering what occasion I am now like to have for it: for out of a poor bishopric of 500l. per annum, I have laid out no less than 1000l. towards the repairs of the church and episcopal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>; nor did I take one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a> for dilapidations. The rest of my little income has been spent, as is necessary, as I am a bishop. Was I influenced by any dislike of the established religion, and secretly inclined towards a church of greater pomp and power? I have, my lords, ever since I knew what Popery was, opposed it; and the better I knew it, the more I opposed it. I began my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>, when the Popish controversy grew hot, with that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a> book of Tillotson's, when he undertook the Protestant cause in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>; and as such, I esteemed him above all. You will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> me, my lords, if I mention one thing: Thirty years ago, I wrote in defense of Martin Luther; and have preached, expressed, and wrote to that purpose from my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a>; and whatever happens to me, I will fulfill anything, and, by God's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a>, burn at the stake, rather than depart from any material point of the Protestant religion as professed in the church of England. Once more: Can I be supposed to favour arbitrary power? The whole tenor of my life has been otherwise: I was always a friend to the liberty of the subject; and, to the best of my power, constantly maintained it. I may have been thought mistaken in the measures I took to support it; but it matters not by what party I was called, so my actions are uniform.\" Afterwards, speaking of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of proceeding against him as unconstitutional, he says: \"My ruin is not of that moment to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of men, to make it worth their while to violate, or even to seem to violate, the constitution in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, which they ought to preserve against any attempts whatsoever. Though I am worthy of no regard, though whatsoever is done to me may for that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> be looked upon to be just; yet your lordships will have some regard to your own lasting interest and that of posterity. This is a proceeding with which the constitution is unacquainted; which, under the pretence of supporting it, will at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> effectually destroy it. For God's sake, lay aside these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> proceedings; let not up these new and dangerous precedents. I, for my part, will voluntarily and cheerfully go into perpetual banishment, and please myself that I am in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the occasion of putting a stop to such precedents, and doing some good to my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>: I will live, wherever I am, praying for its prosperity; and do, in the words of Father Paul to the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>, say, *Eflo perpetua.* It is not my departing from it I am concerned for. Let me depart, and let my country be fixed upon the immovable foundation of law and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, and stand for ever.\"\n\nAfter a solemn profession of his innocence, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to the Searcher of Hearts for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of what he had said, he concludes thus: \"If, on any account, there shall fill be thought by your lordships to be any seeming strength in the proofs against me; if, by your lordships judgments, springing from unknown motives, I shall be thought to be guilty; if, for any reasons or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of state, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> and justice of which I am no competent judge, your lordships shall proceed to pass this bill against me; I shall dispose myself quietly and tacitly to submit to what you do; God's will be done: Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return; and, whether he gives or takes away, blest be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the Lord!\"\n\nOn Monday the 13th he was carried for the last time from the Tower to hear the reply of the king's counsel to his defence. These were both men of great knowledge and sagacity in law, but of different talents in point of eloquence. Their speeches on this occasion were made public; and they seem to have formed their \"Replies,\" designedly, in a different way. The former sticks close to the matter in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, and enforces the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> against the bishop with great strength.\nAtterbury, and perspicuity: The latter answers all his objections, and refutes the arguments brought in his defence, in an easy, soft manner, and with great simplicity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>. Mr Reeve is wholly employed in facts, in comparing and uniting together circumstances, in order to corroborate the proofs of the bishop's guilt; Mr Wearg is chiefly taken up in silencing the complaints of the bishop and his counsel, and replying to everything they advance, in order to invalidate the allegations of his innocence. The one, in short, possesses the minds of the lords with strong convictions against the bishop; the other disposes them of any favourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> that might possibly be made upon them by the artifice of his defence. And accordingly Mr Reeve is strong, nervous, and enforcing; but Mr Wearg, smooth, easy, and insinuating, both in the manner of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> and the turn of his periods.\n\nWearg pays the highest compliments to the bishop's eloquence; but, at the same time, represents it as employed to impose upon the reason, and misguide the judgment of his hearers in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> as it affected their passions; and he endeavours to strip the bishop's defence of all its ornaments and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a>.\n\nOn the 15th the bill was read the third time; and, after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and warm debate, passed on the 16th, by a majority of 83 to 43. On the 27th, the king came to the house, and confirmed it by his royal assent. June 18, 1723, this eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRELATE\">prelate</a>, having the day before taken leave of his friends, who, from the time of passing the bill against him to the day of his departure, had free access to him in the Tower (b), embarked on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALDBOROUGH\">Aldborough</a> man of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, and landed\n\n(b) The following anecdote was first communicated to the public by the late Dr Maty, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> of Lord Chesterfield: \"I went (said Lord Chesterfield) to Mr Pope, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, at Twickenham, and found a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> folio <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIBLE\">bible</a>, with gilt clasps, lying before him upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>; and, as I knew his way of thinking upon that book, I asked him, jocosely, if he was going to write an answer to it? It is a present, said he, or rather a legacy, from my old friend the Bishop of Rochester. I went to take my leave of him yesterday in the Tower, where I saw this bible upon his table. After the first compliments, the Bishop said to me, 'My friend Pope, considering your infirmities, and my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol8.html#article-EXILE\">exile</a>, it is not likely that we should ever meet again; and therefore I give you this legacy to remember me by. Take it home with you; and let me advise you to abide by it.'\u2014Does your Lordship abide by it yourself?\"\u2014I do. 'If you do, my Lord, it is but lately. May I begin to know what new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> or arguments have prevailed with you now, to entertain an opinion so contrary to that which you entertained of that book all the former part of your life?'\u2014The Bishop replied, 'We have not time to talk of these things; but take home the book; I will abide by it, and I recommend you to do so too; and so God bless you.'\n\nThese anecdotes Mr Nichols has inserted in the \"Epistolary Correspondence,\" vol. ii. p. 79, with the professed view of vindicating Atterbury, in the following words of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> correspondent:\n\n\"Dr Warton has revived this story, which he justly calls an 'uncommon' one, in his last '<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on the Genius and Writings of Pope.' It was indeed very uncommon; and I have my reasons for thinking it equally groundless and invidious. Dr Warton, though he retails the story from 'Maty's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a>,' yet candidly acknowledges, that it ought not to be implicitly relied on. That this caution was not unnecessary, will, I apprehend, be sufficiently obvious, from the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of the story itself and Mr Pope's letters to the bishop.\n\n\"According to Lord Chesterfield's account, this remarkable piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> but a few days before the Bishop went into exile: and it is intimated that Mr Pope, till that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, had not even entertained the slightest suspicion of his friend's reverence for the bible: Nay, it is asserted, that the very recommendation of it from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> so unexpected, staggered Mr Pope to such a degree, that in a mingled vein of rillery and ferioufnels, he was very eager to know the grounds and reasons of the Bishop's change of sentiment.\n\n\"Unfortunately for the credit of Lord Chesterfield and his story, there is a letter on record, that was written <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> months before this pretended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a> took place, in which Mr Pope seriously acknowledged the Bishop's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and generosity, in interesting himself to zealously and affectionately in matters which immediately related to his improvement in the knowledge of the holy scriptures. The passage I refer to is a very remarkable one: and you will find it in a letter, dated July 27, 1722. It appears undeniably from this letter, that the Bishop had earnestly recommended to Mr Pope the study of the bible; and had softened his zeal with an unfeigned urbanity and courtesy, in order to avoid the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPUTATION\">imputation</a> of ill-breeding, and remove all occasion of disgust from a mind so 'tremblingly alive' as Mr Pope's. I will transcribe the passage at large. 'I ought first to prepare my mind for a better knowledge even of good profane writers, especially the moralists, &c. before I can be worthy of tafting the Supreme of books, and Sublime of all writings, in which, as in all the intermediate ones, you may (if your friendship and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> towards me continue so far) be the best guide to,\n\nYours, A. Pope.'\n\n\"The last letter of Mr Pope to the Bishop, previous to his going into exile, was written very early in June 1723. It must have been about this time that Pope paid his farewell visit to the Bishop in the Tower. But whether such a conversation as that which hath been pretended actually took place, may be left to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> of every man of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, after comparing Lord Chesterfield's anecdote with Mr Pope's letter.\n\n\"There must have been a mistake, or a wilful misrepresentation somewhere. To determine its origin, or to mark minutely the various degrees of its progress, till it issued forth into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALUMNY\">calumny</a> and falsehood, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>.\"\nAtterbury landed the Friday following at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALAIS\">Calais</a>. When he went on shore, having been informed that Lord Bolingbroke, who had, after the rising of the parliament, received the king's pardon, was arrived at the same place on his return to England, he said, with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of pleasantry, \"Then I am exchanged!\" and it was, in the opinion of Mr Pope on the same occasion, \"a sign of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>'s being curiously afraid of being overrun with too much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a>, when it could not regain one great man but at the expense of another.\" But the severity of his treatment did not cease even with his banishment. The same vindictive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> pursued him in foreign climes. No British subject was even permitted to visit him without the king's sign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a>, which Mr Morice was always obliged to solicit, not only for himself, but for every one of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> whom he carried abroad with him, for which the fees of office were very high.\n\nWhen Bishop Atterbury first entered upon his banishment, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRUSSELS\">Brussels</a> was the place destined for his residence; but, by the arts and intrigues of the British ministers, he was compelled to leave that place, and retire to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>. There being solicited by the friends of the Pretender to enter into their negotiations, he changed his abode for Montpelier in 1728; and, after residing there about two years, returned to Paris, where he died Feb. 15, 1731-2. The affliction which he sustained by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> in 1729, was thought to have hastened his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a>. The former event he hath himself related in a very affecting manner, in a letter to Mr Pope: \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> desire of meeting one I dearly loved, called me abruptly to Montpelier; where, after continuing two months under the cruel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORTURE\">torture</a> of a sad and fruitless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a>, I was forced at last to take a long journey to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TOULOUSE\">Toulouse</a>; and even there I had missed the person I sought, had she not, with great spirit and courage, ventured all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> up the Garonne to see me, which she above all things desired to do before she died. By that means she was brought where I was, between seven and eight in the morning, and lived 20 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> afterwards; which time was not lost on either side, but passed in such a manner as gave great satisfaction to both, and such as, on her part, every way became her circumstances and character: For she had her senses to the very last gasp, and exerted them to give me, in those few hours, greater marks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> and love than she had done in all her lifetime, though she had never been wanting in either. The last words she said to me were the kindest of all; a reflection on the goodness of God, which had allowed us in this manner to meet once more, before we parted for ever. Not many minutes after that, she laid herself on her pillow, in a sleeping posture,\n\nPlacidaque ibi demum morte quietit.\n\nJudge you, Sir, what I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a>, and still feel, on this occasion, and spare me the trouble of describing it. At Atterbury, my age, under my infirmities, among utter strangers, how shall I find out proper reliefs and supports? I can have none, but those with which reason and religion furnish me; and those I laid hold on, and grasp as fast as I can. I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> that He who laid the burden upon me (for wife and good purpose no doubt) will enable me to bear it in like manner as I have borne others, with some degree of fortitude and firmness.\"\n\nHow far the Bishop might have been attached in his inclinations to the Stuart family, to which he might be led by early prejudices of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, and the divided opinions of the times, it is not necessary here to inquire: But that he should have been weak enough to engage in a plot inconsistent with his station, and so clumsily devised (to lay the least of it, and without entering into his solemn avowal of innocence,) is utterly inconsistent with that cunning which his enemies allowed him. The duke of Wharton, it is well known, was violent against him, till convinced by his unanswerable reasoning.\n\nIt has been said that Atterbury's wishes reached to the bishopric of London, or even to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a> or Canterbury. But those who were better acquainted with his views, knew that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINCHESTER\">Winchester</a> would have been much more desirable to him than either of the others. And there are those now living, who have been told from respectable authority, that that bishopric was offered to him whenever it should become vacant (and till that event should happen, a pension of \u00a3500l. a-year, besides an ample provision for Mr Morice), if he would cease to give the opposition he did to Sir Robert Walpole's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a>, by his speeches and protests in the house of lords. When that offer was rejected by the bishop, then the contrivance for his ruin was determined on.\n\nIn his speech in the house of lords, the bishop mentions his being \"engaged in a correspondence with two learned men (Bishop Potter and Dr Wall) on settling the times of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> the four gospels.\" Part of this correspondence is still in being, and will soon be published. The same subject the bishop pursued during his exile, having consulted the learned of all nations, and had nearly brought the whole to a conclusion when he died. These laudable labours are an ample <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUTATION\">confutation</a> of Bishop Newton's assertion, that Atterbury \"wrote little whilst in exile but a few criticisms on French authors.\"\n\nHis body was brought over to England, and interred on the 12th of May following in Westminster <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a>, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VAULT\">vault</a> which in the year 1722 had been prepared by his directions. There is no memorial over his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>; nor could there well be any, unless his friends would have consented (which it is most probable they refused to do) that the words implying him to have died bishop of Rochester should have been omitted on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a>.\n\nSome\n\nI have simply stated matters of fact as they are recorded; and leave it to your readers to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> not quite so obvious and indisputable, as they may think fit. My motives in this very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> relation arose from an honest wish to remove unmerited obloquy from the dead. I should sincerely rejoice if the cloud which in other respects still shades the character of this ingenious prelate could be removed with equal facility and success. I am, dear Sir, your faithful humble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a>,\n\nSamuel Babcock.\nSome time before his death, he published a vindication of himself, Bishop Smalridge, and Dr Aldrich, from a charge brought against them by Mr Oldmixon, of having altered and interpolated the copy of Lord Clarendon's \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of the Rebellion.\" Bishop Atterbury's \"Sermons\" are extant in four volumes in octavo: those contained in the two first were published by himself; and dedicated to his great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JONATHAN\">Jonathan</a> Trelawney bishop of Winchester; those in the two last were published after his death by Dr Thomas Moore his Lordship's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHAPLAIN\">chaplain</a>. Four admirable \"Visititation Charges\" accompany his \"Epistolary Correspondence.\"\n\nAs to Bishop Atterbury's character, however the moral and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> part of it may have been differently represented by the opposite parties, it is universally agreed, that he was a man of great learning and uncommon abilities, a fine writer, and a most excellent preacher. His learned friend Smalridge, in the speech he made when he presented him to the upper house of convocation, as prolocutor, styles him Vir in nulla literarum genere holpes, in plurisque artibus et studiis diu et felicius exercitatus, in maxime perfectis literarum disciplinis perfectissimus. In his controversial writings, he was sometimes too severe upon his adversary, and dealt rather too much in satire and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INVECTIVE\">invective</a>; but this his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PANEGYRIC\">panegyric</a> imparts more to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> fervour of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> than to any bitterness of temper or personal malice. In his sermons, however, he is not only every way unexceptionable, but highly to be commended. The truth is, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> as a preacher was so excellent and remarkable, that it may not improperly be said, that he owed his preferment to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULPIT\">pulpit</a>; nor any hard matter to trace him, through his writings, to his several promotions in the church.\n\nWe shall conclude Bishop Atterbury's character as a preacher, with the encomium bestowed on him by the author of \"the Tatler;\" who, having observed that the English clergy too much neglected the art of speaking, makes a particular exception with regard to our prelate; who, says he, \"has so particular a regard to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a>, that he commits to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> what he has to say to them; and has so soft and graceful a behaviour, that it must attract your attention. His person (continues this author), is to be confessed, is no small recommendation; but he is to be highly commended for not losing that advantage, and adding to propriety of speech (which might pass the criticism of Longinus) an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> which would have been approved by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMOSTHENES\">Demosthenes</a>. He has a peculiar force in his way, and has affected many of his audience, who could not be intelligent hearers of his discourse were there no explanation as well as grace in his action. This art of his is used with the most exact and honest skill. He never attempts your passions, till he has convinced your reason. All the objections which you can form are laid open and dispersed before he uses the least vehemence in his sermon; but when he thinks he has your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, he very soon wins your heart, and never pretends to throw the beauty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a>, till he has convinced you of the truth of it.\"\u2014In his letters to Pope, &c. Bishop Atterbury appears in a pleasing light, both as a writer and as a man. In ease and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a> they are superior to those of Pope, which are more studied.

On this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> Attica was less exposed to invasion than other more fertile countries; and hence it preferred its ancient inhabitants beyond all the other kingdoms in its neighbourhood; so that they were reputed to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> productions of the soil; and as a badge of this, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUCYDIDES\">Thucydides</a> tells us, they wore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> grasshoppers in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> cities in the kingdom of Attica were A-Cities, then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>; next to it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEUSIS\">Eleusis</a>, situated on the same gulf, near the coast of Megara; and next to that Rhamnus famed for the temple of Amphiarus and the statue of the goddes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEMESIS\">Nemesis</a>.\n\nThe first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a> of this country, of whom we have any distinct account, was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CECROPS\">Cecrops</a>. Others indeed are said the first to have reigned before him, particularly one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADONIS\">Adonis</a>, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> Cecrops married, and in her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> laid the foundation of his new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>. Cecrops is said to have been the first who deified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>, set up altars and idols, and instituted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> among the Greeks. He is likewise affirmed to have taught his subjects <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>; and for the better <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, and promoting intercourse among them, to have divided them into the first four tribes, called Cecropis, Antabiblon, Adeia, and Paralia; and he is also by some said to be the founder of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AREOPAGUS\">Areopagus</a>. From this monarch the Athenians affected to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> themselves Cecropide till the reign of Erechtheus their fifth king, after whom they took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Erechtheidae.\n\nCecrops dying after a reign of 50 years, left three daughters; by marrying one of whom, probably, Cranus a wealthy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITIZEN\">citizen</a> ascended the throne. He enjoyed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> peaceably for ten years; till, having married one of his daughters named Attis, to Amphictyon the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEUCALION\">Deucalion</a>, he was by him dethroned, and forced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> a private life to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a>. From this Whence daughter, the country, which before had been called the country Adeia, took the name of Attica.\nAfter a reign of 10 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 12 years, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMPHITRYON\">Amphitryon</a> was himself deposed by Erechthonius, said to be the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VULCAN\">Vulcan</a> and Tethys. Being lame of both his feet, he is said to have invented coaches, or, as others <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> have it, instituted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> and chariot races, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a>. He is also reported to have been the first who stamped silver <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>. He reigned 50 years, and was succeeded by his son Pandion the father of Progne and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOMELA\">Philomela</a>; whose hard fate, so famous among the poets, is supposed to have broke his heart, after a reign of about 40 years. In his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> Triptolemus taught the Athenians <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, which he had learned from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CERES\">Ceres</a>.\n\nPandion was succeeded by his son Eretheus, who being reckoned the most powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of his time, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOREAS\">Boreas</a> king of Thrace demanded his daughter Orithya in marriage; and on being refused carried her off by force. After a reign of 50 years, Eretheus being killed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> with the Eleusians, was succeeded by his son Cecrops II., who is generally allowed to have been the first who gathered the people into towns; they having till then lived in houses and cottages scattered here and there, without order or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>. After a reign of 40 years he was driven out by his brethren Metion and Pandorus, who forced him to fly into \u00c6gialea, where he died.\n\nCecrops II. was succeeded by his son Pandion II., and he was likewise driven out by Metion, who assumed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. Pandion in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time fled into Megara, where he married Pelia the daughter of Pylas king of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and was appointed successor to the kingdom. Here he had four sons, who returning to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, whether with or without their father is uncertain, expelled the sons of Metion, and after the decease of Pandion their father, divided the government among themselves; notwithstanding which, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> did in effect remain with \u00c6geus the eldest.\n\n\u00c6geus, when he ascended the throne, finding himself despised by his subjects because he had no sons, and sometimes insulted by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Pallas, who had no less than fifty, consulted the oracle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DELPHI\">Delphi</a>. Receiving here, as was commonly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, an answer which could not be understood without a commentator, he applied to Pittheus king of Troezen, famous for his skill in expounding oracles. This prince easily prevailed with him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> with his daughter \u00c6thra, who proved with child; and as none but these three were privy to the secret, \u00c6geus, before his return to Athens, hid a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> and a pair of shoes under a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, leaving orders with the princess, that if the child proved a boy, she should send him to Athens with these tokens as soon as he was able to lift up that stone. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> her moreover to use all imaginable secrecy, lest the sons of his brother Pallas should waylay and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> him.\n\n\u00c6thra being delivered of a son, Pittheus gave out that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEPTUNE\">Neptune</a> was the father of it. This child was named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THESEUS\">Theseus</a>, and proved one of the most famous heroes of antiquity. Being arrived at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 16, his mother brought him to the stone above mentioned; and he having lifted it with ease, was desired to take up the sword and shoes and prepare himself to go to his father. He was advised to go by sea rather than by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, as ever since the departure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>, the roads had been exceedingly infested by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANDITTI\">banditti</a>. Theseus, however, who had already begun to discover marks of uncommon strength and courage, no sooner heard the name of Hercules mentioned, than he became desirous of imitating so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> a pattern; and after performing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of glorious exploits, for which see the article Theseus, he arrived safe at his father's capital.\n\nThe great achievements of our young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> pro-Is made cured him a welcome reception at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of \u00c6geus, known to though his birth was unknown to all except Medea, to his father. whom the king had lately been married. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> being a sorceress, it is not to be supposed anything could be concealed from her; therefore, by her diabolical penetration, quickly found out that Theseus was the king's son; after which she became so jealous of him on account of his valour, that she persuaded her old husband to invite the young stranger to a banquet, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> him in a glass of wine. The poison was accordingly prepared, and Theseus invited; but the prince suddenly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> his sword, it was immediately recognized by \u00c6geus to be the same he had formerly buried below the stone. Upon this he stepped forward to Theseus, throwing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the poisoned draught in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>; and, embracing him with much tenderness, owned him for his son before all the court.\n\nAt this time the king of Athens had great occasion for such a champion as Theseus. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> of Pallas, who had all along behaved with great insolence, upon Theseus being discovered to be the king's son, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> to the crown, broke out in open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REBELLION\">rebellion</a>. They were soon discomfited; but \u00c6geus and he kills the whole country of Attica were still in great distress. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINOTAUR\">Minotaur</a>, on the following account. Some years before, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol1.html#article-ANDROGEUS\">Androgeus</a>, the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINOS\">Minos</a> king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRETE\">Crete</a>, came to Athens to be present at one of their feasts. During this visit he contracted such an intimacy with the fifty sons of Pallas, that \u00c6geus, fearing some fatal consequences, caused him to be privately murdered. According to others, Androgeus having undertaken to encounter the Marathonian bull, was killed by it. Be this as it will, Minos having received news of his son's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, imputed it to the people of Attica; and therefore, after several unsuccessful attempts to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> his own quarrel, prayed to the gods to do it for him. The Athenians, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a>, were visited with earthquakes, famine, and pestilence; on account of which they applied to the oracle. Here they were informed, that no relief was to be had till they were reconciled to the Cretan king. Minos resolving to make them pay dear for their deliverance, imposed upon them a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUTE\">tribute</a> of seven young men and as many virgins, whom he condemned to be devoured by the Minotaur, a monster feigned by the poets to have been half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> and half bull. This bloody tribute had been twice paid, and Minos had already sent his messengers the third time, when Theseus willingly offered himself to be one of the unhappy victims; and embarking with them in one ship, he gave the pilot two sails, the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> to fail with, and the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> to be hoisted up at his return in case he came off victorious. Our hero had all the succours he could wish: he killed the Minotaur, prevailed with Minos to remit the tribute, and his daughter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARIADNE\">Ariadne</a> to run away with him; but her he left with child in the isle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAXOS\">Naxos</a>. Unfortunately, however for \u00c6geus, the joy of Theseus and his\nhis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> was so great, that at their return they forgot to hoist the white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a> in token of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a>; upon which the old king, taking for granted that his son was killed, threw himself into the sea, which ever since has from him been called the Aegean Sea.\n\nTheseus being thus left in possession of the kingdom of Attica, began immediately to think of indulging his warlike <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, and rendering the civil affairs of his kingdom as little troublesome as possible. To accomplish this purpose, he began with gathering most of the people of Attica into the old and new town, which he incorporated into one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>. After this he divested himself of all his regal power, except the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of king, the command of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, and the guardianship of the laws. The rest he committed to proper magistrates chosen out of three different orders of the people, whom he divided into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol15.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a>, husbandmen, and artificers. The first he invested with the power of interpreting and executing the laws, and regulating whatever related to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. The other two chose their inferior magistrates from among themselves, to take care of whatever related to their separate orders: so that the kingdom was in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> reduced to a commonwealth, in which the king had the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a>, the nobles were next to him in honour and authority, the husbandmen had the greatest profit, and the artificers exceeded them in number. He likewise abolished all their distinct courts of judicature, and built one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> called Prytaneum, which stood for many ages afterwards.\n\nHaving thus new-modelled the government, his next care was to join to his dominions the kingdom of Megara, in right of his grandfather Pandon II., who had married the daughter of Pylas, as above-mentioned. On this occasion he erected the famous pillar in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISTHMUS\">isthmus</a>, which showed the limits of the two countries that met there. On the one side of this pillar was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a>, \"This is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PELOPONNESUS\">Peloponnesus</a>, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IONIA\">Ionia</a>;\" and on the other, \"This is Peloponnesus, not Ionia.\" After this he undertook an expedition against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMAZONS\">Amazons</a>, whom he overcame, took their queen Hippolita, and afterwards married her. Soon after this, Theseus contracted an intimacy with Perithous the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IXION\">Ixion</a>; and being invited to his nuptials, assisted him in killing a number of Centaurs, or rather Thessalian horsemen (who in their cups had offered violence to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> guests), and drove the rest out of the country. Our two associates then proceeded to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-SPARTA\">Sparta</a>, where Theseus fell in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> with the famed Helena, at that time not above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> years old, while he himself was upwards of fifty. Her they carried off; and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAPE\">rape</a> there are various accounts; but the following one which is given by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-PLUTARCH\">Plutarch</a>, is generally allowed to be the most authentic.\n\nAccording to that historian, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOLE\">stole</a> this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, the greatest in the world at that time, out of the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIANA\">Diana</a> Ortia, where Helena happened to be dancing. They were pursued as far as Tegea, but made their escape out of Peloponnesus; and thinking themselves now secure of their prey, they agreed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> lots for her, upon condition that he who stole the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> should assist the other in procuring some celebrated beauty. Fortune having declared for Theseus, he assisted his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> in the like attempt upon Proserpina daughter of Aidonius king of the Molossi in Epirus; who, being the next beauty to Helena, was guarded by the dog <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CERBERUS\">Cerberus</a>, which had three heads, and was consequently a very formidable enemy. Her father, however, understanding that they designed to steal away his daughter, threw Perithous to be torn in pieces by Cerberus, and put Theseus in prison, from whence he was afterwards relieved at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERCESSION\">intercession</a> of Hercules.\n\nAfter this misfortune, Theseus at length returned to Athens, but found himself very coolly received by his subjects. Mnestheus, the son of Pteus, and great-grandson of Erechtheus, had made use of the king's absence to ingratiate himself with the people; and, upon the commencement of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CASTOR\">Castor</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLLUX\">Pollux</a>, the two brothers of Helena, he persuaded the people of Athens to open their gates to the two brothers. Driven out on this, Theseus was under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of conveying Athens away himself and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> with all possible privacy. This he luckily accomplished; and designed to have sailed to Crete, to have obtained assistance from Deucalion son of Minos, and now brother-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> to Theseus himself, he having lately married Phaedra sister to Deucalion. Unfortunately, however, our hero was shipwrecked on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Scyros. Here he was at first kindly received by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LYCOMEDES\">Lycomedes</a> the king of that island; but was soon after killed by a fall from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> rock, over which some say he was pushed by Lycomedes himself, who had been prevailed upon to destroy Theseus in that manner by Mnestheus, that he might with the more security enjoy the kingdom of Athens.\n\nMnestheus reigned 24 years, but lost his life at the siege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a>; and was succeeded by Demophon one of the sons of Theseus by Phaedra, who was likewise at the siege of Troy, but had the good fortune to return in safety. In his reign was erected the famous court of the Ephete; consisting originally of 50 Athenians and as many Argives, for trying of wilful murders. By this court the king himself afterwards submitted to be tried for having accidentally killed one of his subjects. He reigned 33 years, and was succeeded by his son, according to some, or according to others his brother, Oxyntes, who reigned 12 years. Oxyntes was succeeded by his son Aphydes, who was murdered by Thyrmates the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BASTARD\">bastard</a> son of Oxyntes.\n\nThis king discovered many base qualities unworthy of his dignity; and at last was deposed by his subjects on the following occasion. Xanthus king of Boeotia had a contest with the Athenians about one of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FRONTIER\">frontier</a> towns. He offered to decide the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> by single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> with the king; but this was declined by Thyrmates. It happened, that at that time one Melanthus a Messenian, who had been driven out of his country by the Heraclidae, was come to Athens; who accepted the king of Boeotia's challenge. At the first onset, Melanthus asked his adversary, why he had, contrary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>, brought a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> with him? and as Xanthus immediately looked about to see who was behind him, Melanthus run him through with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LANCE\">lance</a>. This victory, though it did little honour to him who gained it, was so agreeable to the Athenians, that they deposed their cowardly king Thyrmates, after he had reigned 8 years; and appointed Melanthus in his stead, who after a reign of 37 years left the kingdom to his son Codrus.\n\nThis prince reigned about 21 years; during which time the Dorics and Heraclidae had regained all Peloponnesus,\nAttica.\n\nCodrus, being informed that the oracle had promised them victory provided they did not kill the king of the Athenians, came immediately to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of dying for his country. Disguising himself, therefore, like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a>, he went into the enemy's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>, and quarrelling with some of the soldiers, was killed by them. On the morrow, the Athenians knowing what was done, sent to demand the body of their king; at which the invaders were so terrified, that they decamped without striking a blow.\n\nUpon the death of Codrus, a dispute which happened among his sons concerning the succession, furnished the Athenians with a pretence for ridding themselves of their kings altogether, and changing the monarchical form of government into a republican one. It was improbable, they said, that they should ever have so good as king as Codrus; and to prevent their having a worse, they resolved to have no king but Jupiter. That they might not, however, seem ungrateful to the family of Codrus, they made his son Medon their supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>, with the title of archon. They afterwards rendered that office decennial, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> it still in the family of Codrus. The extinction of the Medontidae at last left them without restraint; upon which they not only made this office annual, but created nine archons. By the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> they provided against the too great power of a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>, as by the former they took away all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of the archons having time to establish themselves, so as to change the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>. In a word, they now attained what they had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> sought, viz. the making the supreme magistrates dependent on the people.\n\nWe have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of these archons for upwards of 600 years, beginning with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREON\">Creon</a>, who lived about 684 years before Christ, to Herodes, who lived only 60 years before that time. The first archon of whom we hear any thing worth notice, is named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRACO\">Draco</a>. He reigned in the second, or, as others say, in the last year of the 39th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLYMPIAD\">Olympiad</a>, when it is supposed he published his laws; but though his name is very frequently mentioned in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, yet no connected account can be found either of him or his institutions; only, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, his laws were exceedingly severe, inflicting death for the smallest faults; which gave occasion to one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMADES\">Demades</a> an orator to observe, that the laws of Draco were written with blood, and not with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INK\">ink</a>. For this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> severity he gave no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, than that small faults seemed to him to be worthy of death, and he could find no higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> for the greatest. He was far advanced in years when he gave laws to Athens; and to give his institutions the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, he would not suffer them to be called nomoi, or laws, but thesmoi, or sanctions proceeding from more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> severity of these laws, however, soon made the Athenians weary both of them and the author of them; upon which Draco was obliged to retire to Aegina. Here he was received with the highest honours; but the favour of the inhabitants of this place proved more fatal to him than the hatred of the Athenians; for coming one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>, the audience, to show their regard, threw, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> then was, their cloaks upon him; and the multitude of these being very great, they stifled the old man, who was too weak to disengage himself from their load.\n\nAfter the expulsion of Draco, nothing remarkable happened at Athens till the year before Christ 606, when we find the republic engaged in a war with the Mitylenian Athenians about the city Sigeanum, situated near the mouth of the river Scamander. The Athenian army was commanded by Phrynon, a person equally remarkable for the comeliness of his person and the generosity of his mind. The Mitylenians were commanded by Pittacus, one of the celebrated sages of Greece. As these commanders looked upon the honour of their respective countries to be concerned, they exerted themselves to the utmost. At last they met in single combat: wherein Phrynon depended on his valour only; but Pittacus concealed behind his shield a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>, wherewith he suddenly entangled his antagonist, and easily slew him. This, however, not putting an end to the war, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIANDER\">Periander</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a> of Corinth interposed; and both parties having submitted to his arbitration, he decreed that Sigeanum should belong to the Athenians.\n\nAbout seven years after this war, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> was formed by Cylon son-in-law to Theagenes' tyranny of Megara, who, having by his affable behaviour procured many friends, formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of seizing the sovereignty of Athens. Having consulted the oracle as to the most proper time, he was directed to make the attempt when the citizens of Athens were employed in celebrating their highest feasts to Jupiter. When many of the citizens therefore were gone to the Olympic games, Cylon and his associates made themselves masters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITADEL\">citadel</a>. Here they were instantly besieged by Megacles at that time archon, and soon reduced to great distress for want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. The chief, together with his brother, found means to make their escape, but the meaner sort were left to shift for themselves. In this extremity they fled to the temple of Minerva; from whence Megacles with much ado prevailed upon them to come down and submit themselves to the mercy of their country. Having at last attended to this, they tied a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GODDESS\">goddess</a>, and carried the clue with them, to demonstrate, that though they were out of the temple they were still under Minerva's protection. Unfortunately for them, conspiracy, however, as they passed the temple of the Furies, the torments of which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a>; which Megacles contriving into a renunciation by the goddess, caused his men to fall upon them and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISPATCH\">dispatch</a> as many as they could find. Such as were without the temple were immediately massacred, and those who fled thither again were murdered in their sanctuary. In short, none escaped but such as bribed the wives of the officers of justice. This carnage, however, did not put an end to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEDITION\">sedition</a>. The remains of Cylon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a> created great disturbances, by intimating that the violation of Minerva's sanctuary had drawn down the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> of the gods; and who extended discourses had such an effect, that Megacles and crated by his officers were styled execrable, and held to be persons under the displeasure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>.\n\nDuring the time of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>, the Megarensians attacked Nisaea, which they took, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALAMIS\">Salamis</a>; full war and to completely routed the Athenians in every attempt to recover the latter, that a law was at last passed, by which it should be capital for any one to propose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> of Salamis. About the same time the city was disturbed by reports of frightful appearances, and filled with superstitious fears; the oracle at Delphi\nDelphi was therefore consulted, and an answer returned that the city behoved to be expiated. Upon this, Epimenides the Ph\u0153nician was sent from Crete, to perform the necessary ceremonies, he being reputed a holy man, and one that was deeply skilled in all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of religion. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPIATION\">expiation</a> consisted in taking some black, and some white sheep, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> them all loose, and directing some persons to follow them to those places where they couched, and there to sacrifice them to the local <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">deity</a>. He caused also many temples and chapels to be erected, two of which have been particularly noted, viz. the chapel of Contumely and that of Impudence. This man is said to have looked wistfully on the port of Munychia for a long time, and then to have spoke as follows to those that were near him: \"How <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> is man to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> things! for did the Athenians know what mischief will one day be derived to them from this place, they would eat it with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>.\" This prediction was thought to be accomplished 270 years after, when Antipater constrained the Athenians to admit a Macedonian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARRISON\">garrison</a> into that place.\n\nAbout 997 years before Christ, Solon, the famed Athenian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a> began to show himself to his countrymen. He is said to have been lineally descended from Codrus; but left by his father in circumstances rather necessitous, which obliged him to apply to merchandise: it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, however, both from his words and writings, that he was a disinterested patriot. The shameful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a>, that none under pain of death should propose the recovery of Salamis, grieved him so much, that having composed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGY\">elegy</a> of 100 verses, such as he thought would be most proper to inflame the minds of the people, he ran into the market-place as if he had been mad, with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a> on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, repeating his elegy. A crowd being gathered round the pretended madman, his kinsman Pifistratus mingled among the rest, and observing the people moved with Solon's words, he also seconded him with all the eloquence he as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of; and between them they prevailed so far as to have the law repealed, and a war was immediately commenced against the people of Megara. Who was commander in this expedition is not certain; but the city was recovered, according to the most general account, by the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STRATAGEM\">stratagem</a>. Solon coming with Pifistratus to Colias, and finding there the women busy in celebrating, according to custom, the feast of Ceres, sent a confidant of his to Salamis, who pretended to be no friend to the people of Attica, telling the inhabitants of Salamis, that if they had a mind to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> the fairest of the Athenian ladies, they might now do it by passing over to Colias. The Megarensians giving easy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to what the man said, immediately fitted out a ship; which Solon perceiving from the opposite shore, dismasted the women, and having disguised a number of headless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a> in female habits, under which they concealed every one a dagger, he sent them to the sea-side to dance and divert themselves as the women were wont to do. When those who came from Salamis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> these young persons skipping up and down, they strove who should be first on shore; but were every one of them killed, and their vessel seized; aboard which the Athenians embarking, sailed immediately to Salamis and took it.\n\nOn the return of Solon to Athens, he was greatly honoured by the people, to whom another occasion of admiring his wisdom was quickly afforded. The inhabitants of Cirrha, a town situated in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of Corinth, after having by repeated incursions wafted the territory of Delphi, at last besieged the capital itself, reduced by with a view of making themselves masters of the treasures contained in the temple of Apollo. Advice of this intended sacrilege being sent to the Amphicyrons, who were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>-general of Greece, Solon advised that the matter should be universally referred, and that all the states should join in punishing the Cirrheans, and saving the Delphic oracle. This advice was complied with, and a general war against Cirrha declared. Clyttenes, tyrant of Sicyon, commanded in chief, and Alcmaeon was general of the Athenian quota. Solon went as assistant or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNSELLOR\">counsellor</a> to Clyttenes, and by following his advice the war was conducted to a prosperous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>. For when the Greek army had besieged Cirrha for some time without any appearance of success, the oracle at Delphi was consulted, from whence the following answer was returned:\n\n\"In vain you <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> to take the place before\n\"The sea's blue waves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROLL\">roll</a> o'er the hallow'd thore.\"\n\nThis answer struck the whole army with surprise, till Solon advised Clyttenes to consecrate solemnly the whole territory of Cirrha to the Delphic Apollo; so as that was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> country, the sea must then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-WASH\">wash</a> the sacred coast. According to Paeanias, the city was reduced by the following stratagem, likewise invented by Solon. He caused the river Plittus, which run through Cirrha, to be turned into another channel, hoping thereby to have disfranchised the inhabitants for want of water: but finding they had many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELLS\">wells</a> within the city, and were not to be reduced by that means, he caused a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of roots of hellebore to be thrown into the river, which was then suffered to return into its former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BED\">bed</a>. The inhabitants, overjoyed at the sight of running water, came in troops to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRINK\">drink</a> of it; whereupon an epidemic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a> ensued, and the citizens being no longer able to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> the walls, the town was easily taken.\n\nOn the return of Solon to Athens, he found things again in the utmost confusion. The remnant of Cylon's faction gave out, that all sorts of misfortunes had befallen the republic on account of the impiety of Megacles and his followers; which clamour was heightened by the retaking of Salamis about this time by the Megarensians. Solon interposed, and persuaded those who were styled execrable to abide a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, and 300 persons were chosen to judge them. The event was, that 300 of Megacles's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> who were alive were sent in-party banishment, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> of such as were killed dead were dug up and sent without the limits of their country.\n\nThough this decision restored the public quiet for the three factions, it was not long before the people were divided into three factions, contending about the proper form of government. These were called the Diacrii, Pedicii, and Parali; the first of these were the inhabitants of the hilly country, who declared positively for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMOCRACY\">democracy</a>; the second, dwelling in the lower parts, and who were far more opulent than the former, declared for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLIGARCHY\">oligarchy</a>, as supposing the government would fall mostly into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>; the third party, who lived\non the sea-coast, were people of moderate principles, and therefore were for a mixed government. Besides the disturbances raised on this account, others were occasioned by the rich oppressing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>. According to Plutarch, the poor being indebted to the rich, either tilled their grounds and paid them the fifth part of the produce, or engaged their bodies for their debts, so that many were made slaves at home, and many sold into other countries; nay, some were obliged to sell their children to pay their debts, and others in despair quitted Attica altogether. The greatest part, however, were for throwing off the yoke, and began to look about for a leader, openly declaring that they intended to change the form of government, and make a repartition of lands. In this extremity, the eyes of all the citizens were cast upon Solon. The most prudent were for offering him the sovereignty; but he perceiving their intentions, behaved in such a manner as to cheat both parties, and showed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a> perhaps never equalled. He refused the sovereignty as far as it might have benefited himself; and yet took upon himself all the care and trouble of a prince, for the sake of his people.\n\nHe was chosen archon without having recourse to lots, and after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> disappointed the hopes of both parties. It was Solon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> maxim, That those laws will be best observed which power and justice equally support. Wherever, therefore, he found the old constitution connotant to justice in any tolerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, he refused to make any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> at all, and was at extraordinary pains to show the reason of the changes he did make. In short, being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> judge of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, he sought to rule only by showing his subjects that it was their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> to obey, and not by forcing upon them what he himself esteemed best. Therefore, to a person who asked whether he had given the Athenians the best laws in his power, he replied, \"I have established the best they could receive.\"\n\nAs to the main cause of sedition, viz. the oppressed state of the meaner sort, Solon removed it by a contrivance which he called *siaokthia*, i.e. discharge; but what this was, authors are not agreed upon. Some say that he released all debts then in being, and prohibited the taking any man's person for payment of a debt for the future. According to others, the poor were eased, not by cancelling the debts, but by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a> the interest, and increasing the value of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINA\">mina</a>, which before was made equal to 73 drachmas only, being by him made equal to 100; which was of great advantage to the debtor, and did the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDITOR\">creditor</a> no hurt. It is, however, most probable that the *siaokthia* was a general remittance of all debts whatever, otherwise Solon could not have boasted in his verses that he had removed so many marks of mortgages (b) as were everywhere frequent; that he had freed from apprehension such as were driven to despair, &c.\n\nBut in the midst of all Solon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a> befell him, which, for a time, hurt his reputation, and had almost entirely ruined his schemes. He had consulted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONON\">Conon</a>, Clinias, and Hipponicus, his three friends, on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORATION\">oration</a> prepared with a view to engage the people's consent to the discharge; and these three men, thus knowing there was to be a general discharge of debts, boldly took the opportunity of borrowing vast sums before the law was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMULGATED\">promulgated</a>, in consequence of which they were never obliged to return them.\n\nThis was thought at first to have been done with Solon's consent, and that he had shared in the money; but this suspicion was quickly wiped off when it appeared that the lawgiver himself was a very considerable loser by his own law. His friends, however, could never recover their credit, but were ever afterwards stigmatized with the opprobrious appellation of *chreocopoi*, or debt-finders.\n\nThe Athenians were as little pleased with Solon's management as with their former condition; the rich meditated at first, thinking he had done too much in cancelling the monetary-debts due to them, and the poor that he had done too little, because he had not divided the lands of Attica equally. In a short time, however, they acquiesced in the new institutions, and gave a more public token of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPENTANCE\">repentance</a> than they had before shown of their displeasure, instituting a solemn sacrifice under the name of *Siaokthia*, at the same time that Solon was unanimously elected legislator of Athens, with full power to make laws, and alter or new-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> the constitution as he thought fit.\n\nSolon being now invested with unlimited authority, set about the arduous task of compiling new laws for the turbulent people of Attica; which having at last completed in the best manner he was able, or in the best manner the nature of the people would admit, he procured them to be ratified for 100 years. Such as related to private actions were preserved on parallelograms of wood, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> which reached from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, and turned about upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> like a wheel. These were thence called *axones*, and were placed first in the citadel, and afterwards in the prytaneum, that all the subjects might have access to them when they pleaded. Such as concerned public institutions and sacrifices were contained in triangular tables of stone called *cyberes*. The Athenian magistrates were sworn to observe both; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time these monuments of Solon's wisdom became so famous, that all public acts were from them named *Axones* and *Cyberes*.\n\nAfter the promulgation of the laws, Solon found himself obliged to leave Athens, to prevent his being continually teased for explanations and alterations of them. He therefore pretended an inclination to merchandise, and obtained leave to absent himself for 10 years, during which time he hoped the laws would be grown familiar. From Athens Solon travelled into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, where he conversed with Psenophis the Heliopolitan, and Sonchis the Saite, the most learned priests of that age. From these he learned the situation of the island <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATLANTIS\">Atlantis</a>, of which he wrote an account in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> afterwards continued. *See Atlantis.*\n\n---\n\n(b) The Athenians had a custom of hanging up billets to show that houses were engaged for such and such sums of money.\nFrom Egypt he went to Cyprus, where he was extremely well received by one of the petty kings. This prince lived in a city called Apia, built by Demophon the son of Theseus, on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> near the river Clarus, but in a foil craggy and barren. Solon observing a very pleasant plain below, engaged the king to remove thither; assisted in executing the scheme he had formed; and succeeded so well that a new city was formed, which soon became populous, and out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> to the Athenian legislator was called Solos.\n\nBut while Solon was thus travelling in quest of wisdom, and with a view to benefit those among whom he came, his countrymen, who seem to have resolved on being dissatisfied at all events, had again divided themselves into three factions. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LYCURGUS\">Lycurgus</a> put himself at the head of the country people; Megacles the son of Alcmaeon was at the head of those who lived on the sea coast; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PISISTRATUS\">Pisistratus</a> put himself at the head of the poorer sort, to protect them, as he pretended, from tyranny, but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> to seize on the sovereignty for himself. All the factions pretended to have a vast regard for Solon and his laws, at the same time that they were very desirous of a change; but how they were to be bettered, none of them knew, or pretended to know.\n\nIn the midst of this confusion the legislator returned. Each of the factions paid their court to him, and affected to receive him with the deepest reverence and respect; beseeching him to reaffirm his authority, and compose the disorders which they themselves kept up. This Solon declined on account of his age, which, he said, rendered him unable to speak and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> for the good of his country as formerly; however, he sent for the chiefs of each party, beseeching them in the most pathetic manner not to ruin their common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a>, but to prefer the public good to their own private interest.\n\nPisistratus, who of all the three had perhaps the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a> to follow Solon's advice, seemed to be the most affected with his discourses; but as Solon perceived he affected popularity by all possible methods, he easily penetrated into his designs of affuming the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> power. This he spoke of to Pisistratus himself, at first privately; but as he saw that his admonitions in this way had no effect, he then said the same things to others, that the public might be on their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against him.\n\nAll the wise discourses of Solon, however, were lost upon the Athenians. Pisistratus had got the manner for entirely at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>, and therefore resolved to cheat them out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> which they certainly deserved to lose. With this view he wounded himself, and, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a> says, the mules that drew his chariot; then he drove into the market-place, and there showed his bleeding body, imploring the protection of the people from those whom his kindness to them had rendered his implacable enemies. A concourse of people being instantly formed, Solon came among the rest, and, suspecting the deceit, openly taxed Pisistratus with his perfidious conduct; but to no purpose. A general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> of the people was called, wherein it was moved by one Arifton, that Pisistratus should have a guard. Solon was the only person present who had resolution enough to oppose this measure; the richer Athenians, perceiving that the multitude implicitly followed Pisistratus, and applauded every thing he said, remaining silent through fear. Solon himself, when he saw he could prevail nothing, left the assembly, saying he was wiser than some, and slower than others. A guard of 400 men was now unanimously decreed to Pisistratus, as we are told by Solon himself. This inconsiderable body he made use of to enslave the people, but in what manner he accomplished his purpose is not agreed. Certain it is, that with his guard he seized the citadel; but Polysemas hath given an account of a very singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> which he took to put it out of the power of the Athenians to defend themselves even against such a small number. He summoned an assembly to be held at the Anacium, and directed that the people should come thither armed. They accordingly came; and Pisistratus harangued them, but in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> so low that they could not tell what he said. The people complaining of this, Pisistratus told them that they were hindered from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> him by the clangour of their arms; but if they would lay them down in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PORTICO\">portico</a>, he would then be heard distinctly. This they did; and while they listened very attentively to a long and eloquent oration, Pisistratus's guard conveyed away their arms, so that they found themselves deprived of all power of resistance. During the confusion which followed this event, another assembly was held, Athens, wherein Solon inveighed bitterly against the meanness of his countrymen, inviting them to take up arms in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of their liberty. When he saw that nothing would do, he laid down his own arms, saying, that he had done his utmost for his country and his laws. According to Plutarch, he refused to quit the city; but the most probable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> is, that he immediately retired from the dominion of Athens, and refused to return, even at the solicitation of Pisistratus himself.\n\nPisistratus, having thus obtained the sovereignty, did not overturn the laws of Solon, but used his power with the greatest moderation. It is not to be expected, however, that so turbulent a people as the Athenians could be satisfied by any method of government he could lay down. At the beginning of his administration, Megacles and his family retired out of Athens to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> their own lives, yet without despairing of being able some time or other to return. With this view Megacles and his associates entered into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> with Lycurgus; and having brought him and his party into a scheme for deposing Pisistratus, they concerted matters so well, that Pisistratus was soon obliged to seek shelter somewhere else, and, on his departure, the Athenians ordered his goods to be sold. Nobody, however, except one person (Callias), would venture to buy any of them, from an apprehension, no doubt, that they would soon be restored to their proper owner, which accordingly happened in a very short time.\n\nAs Megacles and his party had negotiated with Lycurgus to turn out Pisistratus, so they now entered into after rein a treaty with Pisistratus to reinstate him in his principality, as soon as they found Lycurgus would not be implicitly governed by them. To accomplish this, they fell upon a very ridiculous project; which, however, was attended with the desired success. They found out a woman whose name was Phya, of a mean family and fortune, but of a great stature, and very handsome.\nHer they drest in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMOUR\">armour</a>, placed her in a chariot, and having dispofed things fo as to make her appear with all poffible advantage, they conducted her towards the city, fending heralds before, with orders to speak to the people in the following terms: \"Give a kind reception, O Athenians, to Pifistratus, who is fo much honoured by Minerva above all other men, that he herelf condefends to bring him back to the citadel.\" The report being universally spread that Minerva was bringing home Pifistratus, and the ignorant multitude believing this woman to be the goddefs, addrefled their prayers to her, and received Pifistratus with the utmoft joy. When he had recovered the fovereignty, Pifistratus married the daughter of Megacles as he had promised, and gave the pretended goddefs to his fon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HIPPARCHUS\">Hipparchus</a>.\n\nPifistratus did not long enjoy the kingdom to which he had been retorted in fo strange a manner. He had married the daughter of Megacles, as already obferved; but having children by a former wife, and remembering that the whole family of Megacles was retrobated by the Athenians, he thought proper to let his new fpoufe remain in a flate of perpetual widowhood. This the patientely bore for fome time, but at laft acquainted her mother. An affront fo grievous could not fail to be highly refented. Megacles instantly entered into a treaty with the malcontents, of whom there were always great plenty at Athens whatever was the form of government. This Pifistratus being apprized of, and perceiving a new form gathering, he voluntarily quitted Athens, and retired to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ERETRIA\">Eretria</a>. Here having consulted with his fon, it was refolved to reduce Athens by force. With this view he applied to feveral of the Greek flates, who furnifhed him with the troops he defired, but the Thebans exceeded all the reft in their liberality; and with this army he returned to Attica, according to Herodotus, in the 11th year of his baniftment. They firft reduced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARATHON\">Marathon</a>, the inhabitants of which had taken no meafures for their defence, though they knew that Pifistratus was preparing to attack them. The republican forces in the mean time marched out of Athens to attack him; but beholding in a fecure and carelefs manner, they were surprifed by Pifistratus, and totally routed. While they were endeavouring to make their escape, he caufed his two fons to ride before him with all speed, and tell thofe they came up with that nobody had any thing to fear, but that they might every one return to his own home. This stratagem fo effectually dispersed the republican army, that it was impoffible to rally them, and Pifistratus became a third time <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> master of Attica.\n\nPifistratus being once more in poffefion of the fovereignty, took a method of eftablifhing himfelf on the throne directly oppofite to what Theseus had done. Instead of collecting the inhabitants from the country into cities, Pifistratus made them retire from the cities into the country; in order to apply themfelves to agriculture. This prevented their meeting together, and caballing againft him in fuch bodies as they had been accustomed to do. By this means alfo the territory of Athens was greatly meliorated, and great plantations of olives were made over all Attica, which had before not only been deftitute of corn, but alfo bare of trees. It alfo commanded, that, in the city, men fhould wear a kind of fleep-ikin veft, reaching to the knees; but fo intolerable were the laws of Pifistratus to his fubjects, that this kind of garment in fucceeding times became proverbially the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>.\n\nAs prince of Athens, Pifistratus received the tenth part of every man's revenues, and even of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; and this alfo, though for the fervice of the flate, feemed to the Athenians a moft grievous burden. In fhort, though Pifistratus behaved in all respects as a moft excellent prince, his fubjects fancied themfelves oppreffed by tyranny, and were perpetually grumbling from the time he firft ascended the throne to the day of his death, which happened about 33 years after he had firft assumed the fovereignty, of which time, according to Ariftotle, he reigned 17 years.\n\nPifistratus left behind him two fons named Hipparchus and Hippias, both men of great abilities, who and Hipparchus shared the government between them, and behaved with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and moderation. But though by the mildnefs of their government the family of the Pifistratidae feemed to be fully eftablifhed on the throne of Athens, a conspiracy was unexpectedly formed againft both the brothers, by which Hipparchus was taken off, and Hippias narrowly efcape. The moft material facts relating to this conspiracy are what follow.\n\nThere were at that time in Athens two young men, Conipiracy called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-HARMODIUS\">Harmodius</a> and Ariftogiton; the former of thefe of Harmo was exquifitely beautiful in his perfon, and on that account, according to the infamous cuftom of the Greeks, violently beloved of Hipparchus; who, if we may believe Thucydides, forced him. This was grievously refented, and revenge determined on; to haften which, another accident concurred. Hipparchus, finding that Harmodius endeavoured to avoid him, publicly affronted him, by not fuffering his fitter to carry the offering of Minerva, as if he was a perfon unworthy of that office. The two young men, not daring to fhew any public signs of refentment, confulted privately with their friends; among whom it was refolved, that at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> festival of Panathenaea, when the citizens were allowed to appear in arms, they fhould attempt to refore Athens to its former liberty. In this they imagined that they fhould find themfelves fconded by the whole body of the people. But when the day appointed was come, they perceived one of their number talking very familiarly with Hippias; and Hipparchus fearing that they were difcovered, they immediately killed fell upon Hipparchus, and defpatched him with a multitude of wounds. In this exploit the people were fo far from fconding them, as they expected, that they fuffered Harmodius to be killed by Hipparchus's guards, and feizing Ariftogiton themfelves, delivered him up to Hippias. Some time afterwards, however, the refpect they paid to thefe two young men exceeded all bounds. They caufed their praiifes to be fung at the Panathenaea, forbade any citizen to call a flave by either rators of their names, and erected brazen ftatues to them in travgantly the forum; which ftatues were afterwards carried into Perfa by Xerxes, and fent back from thence by Alexander the Great, Antiochus, or Seleucus, for authors are not agreed by which. Several immunities and privileges were alfo granted to the defendants of thefe.\nthese two patriots, and all possible means were taken to render their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> venerable and respected by posterity.\n\nHippias being now sole master of Athens, and probably exasperated by the murder of his brother, began to alter his conduct greatly, and treat his subjects in an oppressive and cruel manner. He began with torturing Arifogiton, in order to make him confess his accomplices; but this proved fatal to his own friends: for Arifogiton impeaching such as he knew to be best affected to Hippias, they were immediately put to death; and when he had destroyed all those he knew, at last told Hippias, that now he knew of none that deserved to suffer death except the tyrant himself. Hippias next vented his rage on a woman named Leana, who was kept by Arifogiton. She endured the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORTURE\">torture</a> as long as she could; but finding herself unable to bear it any longer, she at last bit off her tongue, that she might not have it in her power to make any discovery. To her the Athenians erected the statue of a lioness, alluding to her name, without a tongue, on which was engraved a suitable inscription.\n\nAfter the conspiracy was, as Hippias thought, thoroughly quashed, he set himself about strengthening his government by all the means he could think of. He contracted leagues with foreign princes, increased his revenues by various methods, &c. But these precautions were of little avail; the lenity of Pisistratus's government had alone supported it; and Hippias pursuing contrary methods, was deprived of his sovereignty in less than four years after the death of his brother.\n\nThis revolution was likewise owing to the family of Megacles, who were styled Alcmeonidae, and had settled at Lipydium. In times of discontent, which at Athens were very frequent, this family was the common refuge of all who fled from that city; and at last they thought of a method of expelling the Pisistratidae altogether. The method they took to accomplish their purpose was as follows. They agreed with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMPHICTYONS\">Amphictyons</a> to rebuild the temple at Delphi; and being possessed of immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, they performed their engagement in a much more magnificent manner than they were bound to do; for having agreed only to build the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of common stone, they built it of Parian marble. At the same time they corrupted the prophetess <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHIA\">Pythia</a>, engaging her to exhort all the Lacedemonians that came to consult the oracle either in behalf of the state, or their own private affairs, to attempt the delivery of Athens. This had the desired effect: the Lacedemonians, surprised at hearing this admonition incessantly repeated, at last resolved to obey the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> command, as they imagined it to be; and sent Anchimolius, a man of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, at the head of an army into Attica, though they were at that time in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> with Hippias, and accounted by him his good friends and allies. Hippias demanding assistance from the Thessalians, they readily sent him 1000 horse, under the command of one of their princes named Sineas. The Lacedemonians being landed, Hippias fell upon them so suddenly, that he defeated them with great slaughter, killed their general, and forced the shattered remains of their army to fly to their ships. The Spartans, incensed at this unfortunate expedition, determined to send another army into Attica; which they accordingly did soon after under their king <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CLEOMENES\">Cleomenes</a>; and he having, at his entrance into the Athenian territories, defeated the Thessalian horse, obliged Hippias to shut himself up in the city of Athens, which he was soon after forced to abandon altogether. He was, however, in no want of a place of refuge; the Thessalian princes inviting him into their country, and the king of Macedon offering his family a city and territory, if they chose to retire into his dominions. But Hippias chose rather to go to the city of Sigeanum, which Pisistratus had conquered, and left to Sigeanum his own family.\n\nAfter the expulsion of the Pisistratidae, the Athenians did not long enjoy the quiet they had promised themselves. They were quickly divided into two factions; at the head of one was Clyttenes, one of the chief of the Alcmeonidae; and of the other, Isagoras, a man of great quality, and highly in favour with the Athenian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>. Clyttenes applied himself to the people, and endeavoured to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> their affection by increasing their power as much as possible. Isagoras perceiving that by this means his rival would get the better, applied to the Lacedemonians for assistance, reviving at the same time the old story of Megacles's privilege, and insisting that Clyttenes ought to be banished as being of the family of Megacles. Cleomenes the Spartan king of Sparta readily came into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, and suddenly despatched a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HERALD\">herald</a> to Athens with a declaration of war in case all the Alcmeonidae were not immediately banished. The Athenians did not hesitate to banish their benefactor Clyttenes, and all his relations; but this piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INGRATITUDE\">ingratitude</a> did not answer their purpose. Cleomenes entered Attica at the head of a Spartan army; and, arriving at Athens, condemned to banishment 700 families more than what had been sent into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol8.html#article-EXILE\">exile</a> before. Not content with this, he would have dissolved the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>, and vested the government in 300 of the chief of Isagoras's faction. This the Athenians would by no means submit to; and therefore took up arms, and drove Cleomenes and his troops into the citadel, where they were besieged for two days. On the third day Cleomenes surrendered, on condition that all those who were in the citadel should retire unmolested. This, though agreed to, was not performed by the Athenians. They fell upon such as were separated from the army, and put them to death without mercy. Among the number of those slain on this occasion was Timelitheus the brother of Cleomenes himself.\n\nThe Spartan king was no sooner withdrawn from Athens, than he formed a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> in favour of Isagoras. He engaged the Boeotians to attack Attica on the one side, and the Chalcidians on the other, while he at the head of a powerful Spartan army entered the territories of Eleusina. In this distress, the Athenians, not being able to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPE\">cope</a> with so many enemies at once, resolved to suffer their territories to be ravaged by the Chalcidians and Boeotians, contenting themselves with opposing the army commanded by Cleomenes in person. But this powerful confederacy was quickly dissolved: the Corinthians, who were allied with Cleomenes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOUBTING\">doubting</a> the justice of their cause, returned home; his other allies likewise beginning to waver, and his colleague Ariftos, the other king of Sparta, differing in sentiments, Cleomenes\nAttica.\n\nmenes was obliged to abandon the enterprise. The Spartans and their allies being withdrawn, the Athenians took a severe revenge of the Boeotians and Chalcidians, totally routing their forces, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> off a great number of prisoners. The prisoners taken in this war were put in irons, but afterwards set at liberty on paying a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RANSOM\">ransom</a> of two minae per head. Their fetters were, however, hung up in the citadel; and the Athenians consecrating the tenth of what they had received for ransom, purchased a statue, representing a chariot and four horses, which they set up in the portico of the citadel, with a triumphant inscription in token of their victory.\n\nThese indignities rousing the Boeotians, they immediately vowed revenge, and engaged on their side the people of \u00c6gina, who had an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> hatred at the Athenians; and while the latter bent all their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the Boeotian war, the \u00c6ginetans landing a considerable army, ravaged the coasts of Attica.\n\nBut while the Athenians were thus employed against the Boeotians and \u00c6ginetans, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a> sprung up on the part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LACEDEMON\">Lacedemon</a>, which was never afterwards eradicated. Cleomenes, after his unsuccessful expedition against Attica, produced at Sparta certain oracles which he said he had found in the citadel of Athens while he was besieged therein: the purport of these oracles was, that Athens would in time become a rival to Sparta. At the same time it was discovered, that Clytineus had bribed the priests of Apollo to cause the Lacedemonians to expel the Plisthratide from Athens; which was sacrificing their best friends to those whom interest obliged to be their enemies. This had such an effect, that the Spartans, repenting their folly in expelling Hippias, sent for him from Sigeum, in order to restore him to his principality: but this not being agreed to by the rest of the states, they were forced to abandon the enterprise, and Hippias returned to Sigeum as he came.\n\nAbout this time, too, Aristagoras the Milesian having set on foot a revolt in Ionia against the Persian king, applied to the Spartans for assistance; but they declining to have any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> in the matter, he next applied to the Athenians, and was by them furnished with 20 ships under the command of Melanthis, a nobleman universally esteemed. This rash <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> cost the Greeks very dear, as it brought upon them the whole power of the Persian empire; for no sooner did the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a> hear of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> sent from Athens to his rebellious subjects, than he declared himself the sworn enemy of that city, and solemnly besought God that he might one day have it in his power to be revenged on them.\n\nThe Ionian war being ended, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of that country again under the Persian government, the king of Persia sent to demand earth and water as tokens of submission from the Greeks. Most of the islanders yielded to this command out of fear, and among the rest the people of \u00c6gina; upon which the Athenians accused the inhabitants of this island of treachery towards Greece, and a war was carried on with them for a long time. How it ended we are not informed; but its continuance was fortunate for Greece in general, as, by inuring them to war, and sea-affairs in particular, it prevented the whole of the Grecian states from being swallowed up by the Persians who were now about to invade them.\n\nBesides the displeasure which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DARIUS\">Darius</a> had conceived against the Athenians on account of the affiance they had afforded the Ionians, he was further engaged to an expedition against Greece by the intrigues of Hippias. Immediately on his returning unsuccessfully from La-Hippas apedemon, as above related, Hippias palled over into piles to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, went to Artaphernes governor of the adjacent provinces belonging to the Persian king, and excited him to make war upon his country, promising to be obedient to the Persian monarch provided he was restored to the principality of Athens. Of this the Athenians being apprised, sent ambassadors to Artaphernes, desiring leave to enjoy their liberty in quiet: but that nobleman returned for answer, that if they would have peace with the great king, they must immediately receive Hippias; upon which answer the Athenians resolved to assist the enemies of Darius as much as possible. The consequence of this resolution was, that Darius commissioned Mardonius to revenge him of the insults he thought the Greeks had offered him. But Mardonius having met with a storm at sea, and other accidents which rendered him unable to do anything, Datis and Artaphernes the son of Artaphernes above-mentioned, were commissioned to do what he was to have done.\n\nThe Persian commanders, fearing again to attempt to double the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMONTORY\">promontory</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHOS\">Athos</a>, where their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> had formerly suffered, drew their forces into the plains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CILICIA\">Cilicia</a>; and pausing from thence through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-CYCLADES\">Cyclades</a> to Euboea, directed their course to Athens. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> from Darius was to destroy both Eretria and Athens; and to bring away the inhabitants, that they might be at his disposal. Their first attempt was Eretria destroyed. Eretria, the inhabitants of which sent to Athens for assistance on the first approach of the Persian fleet.\n\nThe Athenians, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a> almost unparalleled at such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a>, sent 4000 men to their assistance; but the Eretrians were so much divided amongst themselves, that nothing could be resolved on. One party among them was for receiving the Athenian succours into the city; another, for abandoning the city and retiring into the mountains of Euboea; while a third fought to betray their country to the Persians for their own private interest. Seeing things in this situation, therefore, and that no good could possibly be done, one \u00c6schines, a man of great authority among the Eretrians, generously informed the Athenian commanders that they might return home. They accordingly retired to Oropus, by which means they escaped <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a>: for Eretria being soon after betrayed to the Persians, was pillaged, burnt, and its inhabitants sold for slaves.\n\nOn the news of this disaster the Athenians immediately drew together all the forces they were able, which after all amounted to no more than 9000 men. These, with 1000 Plateans who afterwards joined them, were commanded by ten general officers, who had equal power; among whom were Miltiades, Arildides, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEMISTOCLES\">Themistocles</a>, men of distinguished valour and great abilities. But it being generally imagined that so small a body of troops would be unable to resist the formidable power of the Persians, a messenger was dispatched...\npatched to Sparta to entreat the immediate affiance of that state. He communicated his business to the senate in the following terms: \"Men of Lacedemon, the Athenians defy you to affiant them, and not to suffer the most ancient of all the Grecian cities to be enslaved by the barbarians. Eretria is already destroyed, and Greece consequently weakened by the loss of so considerable a place.\" The affiance was readily granted; but at the same time the succours arrived too slowly, that the Athenians were forced to fight without them. In this memorable engagement in the plains of Marathon, whither Hippias had conducted the Persians, the latter were defeated with the loss of 6300 men, while the Greeks lost only 192. The Persians being thus driven to their ships, endeavoured to double <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> Sunium, in order to surprise Athens itself before the army could return; but in this they were prevented by Miltiades; who, leaving Arisides with 1000 men to guard the prisoners, returned to expeditiously with the other 9000, that he was at the temple of Hercules, which was but a small way distant, before the barbarians could attack the city.\n\nAfter the battle, Arisides discharged the trust reposed in him with the greatest integrity. Though there was much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> and silver in the Persian camp, and the tents and ships they had taken were filled with all sorts of riches, he not only forbore touching anything himself, but to the utmost of his power prevented others from doing it. Some, however, found means to enrich themselves; among the rest, one Callias, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a>-german to Arisides himself. This man being a torch-bearer, and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of his office, having a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILLET\">fillet</a> on his head, one of the Persians took him for a king, and, falling down at his feet, discovered to him a vast quantity of gold hid in a well. Callias not only feasted, and applied it to his own use, but had the cruelty to kill the poor man who discovered it to him, that he might not mention it to others; by which infamous action he entailed on his posterity the name of Laccoplitus or enriched by the well.\n\nAfter the battle of Marathon, all the inhabitants of Platea were declared free citizens of Athens, and Miltiades, Themistocles, and Arisides, were treated with all possible marks of gratitude and respect. This, however, was but very short-lived; Miltiades proposed an expedition against the island of Paros, in which having been unsuccessful, through what cause is not well known, he was, on his return, accused, and condemned to pay 50 talents, the whole expense of the scheme; and, being unable to pay the debt, was thrown into prison, where he soon died of a wound received at Paros.\n\nIf any thing can exceed the enormity of such a proceeding as this, it was the treatment Arisides next received. Miltiades had proposed an expedition, which had not proved successful, and in which he might possibly have had bad designs; but against Arisides not so much as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> of guilt was pretended. On the contrary, his extraordinary virtue had procured him the title of \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2, and he had never been found to swerve from the maxims of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a>. His downfall was occasioned by the intrigues of Themistocles; who being a man of great abilities, and hating Arisides on account of the character he deservedly bore among his countrymen, took all opportunities of insinuating, that his rival had in fact made himself master of Athens without the parade of guards and royalty. \"He gives laws to the people (said he); and what constitutes a tyrant, but giving laws?\" In consequence of this strange argument, a strong party was formed against the virtuous Arisides, and it was resolved to banish him for 10 years by the ostracism. In this case, the name of the person to be banished was written upon a shell by every one who desired his exile, and carried to a certain place within the forum enclosed with rails. If the number of shells so collected exceeded 6000, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> was inflicted; if not, it was otherwise. When the agents of Themistocles had sufficiently accomplished their purposes, on a sudden the people flocked to the forum, defying the ostracism. One of the clowns who had come from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOROUGH\">borough</a> in the country, bringing a shell to Arisides, said to him, \"Write me Arisides upon this.\" Arisides, surprised, asked him if he knew any ill of that Athenian, or if he had ever done him any hurt? \"Me hurt!\" (said the fellow, no, I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DON\">don</a>'t so much as know him; but I am weary and sick at heart on hearing him everywhere called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a>.\" Arisides, therefore, took the shell, and wrote his own name upon it; and when informed that the ostracism fell upon him, modestly retired out of the forum, saying, \"I beseech the gods that the Athenians may never see that day which shall force them to remember Arisides.\"\n\nAfter the battle of Marathon, the war with \u00c6gina was revived with great vigour; but the \u00c6ginetans generally had the superiority, on account of their great naval power. Themistocles observing this, was continually exhorting his countrymen to build a fleet, not only to make them an equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> for the \u00c6ginetans, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of a fleet; which proposal being complied with, 100 galleys were immediately put upon the stocks; and this sudden increase of their maritime power proved the means of saving all Greece from slavery.\n\nAbout three years after the banishment of Arisides, Xerxes, king of Persia sent to demand earth and water; vadei but Themistocles desiring to make the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> with Greece, that monarch still wider, put to death the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERPRETER\">interpreter</a> for publishing the decree of the king of Persia in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of the Greeks; and having prevailed upon the several states to lay aside their animosities, and provide for their common safety, got himself elected general of the Athenian army.\n\nWhen the news arrived that the Persians were advancing to invade Greece by the straits of Thermopylae, and that they were for this purpose transporting their forces by sea, Themistocles advised his countrymen to quit the city, embark on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> their galleys, and meet their enemies while yet at a distance. This they would by no means comply with; for which reason Themistocles put himself at the head of the army, and having joined the Lacedemonians, marched towards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-TEMPE\">Tempe</a>. Here, having received advice that the straits of Thermopylae were forced, and that both Boeotia and Thessaly\nThebes had submitted to the Persians, the army returned without doing anything.\n\nIn this distress the Athenians applied to the oracle at Delphi; from whence they received at first a very severe answer, threatening them with total destruction; but after such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMILIATION\">humiliation</a>, a more favourable one was delivered, in which, probably by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of Themistocles, they were promised safety in walls of wood.\n\nThis was by Themistocles and the greatest part of the citizens interpreted as a command to abandon Athens, and put all their hopes of safety in their fleet. Upon this, the opinion of Themistocles prevailing, the greatest part began to prepare for this embarkation; and had money distributed among them by the council of the Areopagus, to the amount of eight drachmas per man: but this not proving sufficient, Themistocles gave out that somebody had stolen the shield of Minerva; under pretence of searching for which, he seized on all the money he could find. Some, however, there were who refused to embark with the rest, but raised to themselves fortifications of wood; understanding the oracle in its literal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, and resolving to wait the arrival of the Persians, and defend themselves to the last. In the mean time Aristeides was recalled, when the Athenians saw it their interest, lest he should have gone over to the Persians and assisted them with his advice.\n\nThe Persians having advanced to Athens soon after the inhabitants had deserted it, met with no opposition except from a few just now mentioned; who, as they would hearken to no terms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>, were cut in pieces, and the city utterly destroyed. Xerxes, however, being defeated in a sea fight at Salamis, was forced to fly with prodigious loss. See Salamis. Themistocles was for pursuing him, and breaking down the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> he had cast over the Hellespont; but this advice being rejected, he sent a trusty messenger to Xerxes, acquainting him that the Greeks intended to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> down his bridge, and therefore desired him to make all the haste he could, lest by that means he should be shut up in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. According to Herodotus, he also advised the Athenians to quit the pursuit and return home, in order to build their ruined houses. This advice, though misinterpreted by some, was certainly a very prudent one, as Xerxes, though once defeated, was still at the head of an army capable of destroying all Greece; and had he been driven to despair by finding himself shut up or warmly pursued, it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to say what might have been the event. After this, Themistocles formed a scheme, for the aggrandisement of Athens indeed, but a most unjust and infamous one. It was, in short, to make Athens mistress of the sea, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> all the ships except those belonging to that republic. He told his countrymen, that he had something to propose of great consequence, but which could not be spoken publicly: whereupon he was desired to communicate it to Aristeides, by whom the proposal was rejected; and Aristeides having informed the Athenians that what Themistocles had said was very advantageous but very unjust, they desired him to think no more of it.\n\nWhen the fleet returned to Salamis, extraordinary honours were paid to Themistocles by the Lacedemonians. On his entering that city, they decreed him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WREATH\">wreath</a> of olives as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>; presented him with the most magnificent chariot in Sparta: and when he returned to Athens, he was escorted by 500 horses, an honour never paid to any stranger but himself. On his arrival at Athens, however, there were not wanting some who insinuated that the receiving such honours from the Lacedemonians was injurious to the republic; but Themistocles, confident in his innocence, treated these clamours with contempt, and exhorted his countrymen to entertain no doubts of their allies, but rather endeavour to preserve the great reputation they had acquired throughout all Greece.\n\nThe defeat of Xerxes at Salamis made Mardonius, who was left to carry on the war by land, more ready to treat with the Athenians than to fight them; and with this view he sent Alexander king of Macedon to Athens to make proposals of alliance with that republic, exclusively of all the other Grecian states. This proposal, however, was rejected; and the consequence Athens was, that Athens was a second time destroyed, the second time Spartans sending assistance so slowly, that the Athenians were forced to retire to Salamis; but they were soon freed from all apprehensions by the total defeat and death of Mardonius at Plat\u00e6a; where Aristeides, and defeated at the body of troops under his command, distinguished Plat\u00e6a and themselves in a most extraordinary manner.\n\nThe same day that the battle of Plat\u00e6a was fought, the Persians were defeated in a sea-fight at Mycale in Ionia, wherein it was allowed that the Athenians who were there behaved better than any of the other Greeks; but when it was proposed to transport the Ionians into Europe, that they might be in perfect safety, and give them the territories of such Grecian states as had sided with the Persians, the Athenians refused to comply, fearing the Ionians would rival them in trade, or refuse the obedience they used to pay them; besides which, they would then lose the opportunity of plundering the Persians in case of any quarrel with Ionia. Before they returned home, however, the Athenians crossed over to the Cheronean, and besieged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SESTOS\">Sestos</a>. The siege was long and troublesome; but at last the garrison, being starved with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>, and having no hopes of relief, divided themselves into two bodies, and endeavoured to Athenians, make their escape; but were pursued, and all either killed or taken. Oikasus, one of their commanders, was sacrificed to a Thracian god; and the other, called Artayater, impaled alive, and his son stoned before his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, because he had railed the sepulchre of Proteus.\n\nAfter the victories at Plat\u00e6a and Mycale, the Athenians returned without any apprehension, and began to rebuild their city in a more magnificent manner than before. Here they were no sooner arrived than a dispute was ready to be commenced about the form of government. The commons, with Themistocles at their head, were for a democracy; to which Aristeides, rather than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAZARD\">hazard</a> the raising disturbances, consented. It was therefore proposed, that every citizen should have an equal right to the government; and that the archons should be chosen out of the body of the people, without preference or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>; and this proposal being agreed to, put an end to all discontents for the present.\n\nAt this time also Themistocles proposed that the city of Athens should be fortified in the best manner possible, that it might not be liable to be again destroyed,\nwhen the Persians should take it into their heads to invade Greece. At this proposal the Lacedemonians were exceedingly alarmed; and therefore remonstrated, that should Athens once be strongly fortified, and the Persians become possessed of it, it would be impossible to get them out of it again. At last, seeing these arguments had no effect, they absolutely forbade the Athenians to carry their walls any higher. This command gave great offence; but Themistocles, considering the power of Sparta at that time, advised the Athenians to temporize; and to allure the ambassadors, that they should proceed no farther in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, till, by an embassy of their own, satisfaction should be given to their allies. Being named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> at his own desire to Sparta, with some other Athenians, Themistocles set out alone, telling the senate that it would be for the interest of the state to delay sending the other ambassadors as long as possible. When arrived at Sparta, he put off from time to time receiving an audience, on account of his colleagues not being arrived; but in the meantime the walls of Athens were building with the utmost expedition; neither houses nor sepulchres being spared for materials; and men, women, children, strangers, citizens, and servants, working without intermission. Of this the Lacedemonians having notice and the rest of the Athenian ambassadors being arrived, Themistocles and his colleagues were summoned before the ephori, who immediately began to exclaim against the Athenians for their breach of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a>. Themistocles denied the charge: he said his colleagues assured him of the contrary: that it did not become a great state to give heed to vague reports, but that deputies ought to be sent from Sparta to inquire into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of the matter, and that he himself would remain as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSTAGE\">hostage</a>, to be answerable for the event. This being agreed to, he engaged his associates to advise the Athenians to commit the Spartan ambassadors to safe custody till he should be released; after which he publicly avowed the whole transaction, took the scheme upon himself, and told the Lacedemonians that \"all things are lawful for our country.\" The Spartans, seeing no remedy, concealed their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a>, and sent Themistocles home in safety.\n\nThe next year, being the last of the 75th Olympiad, Themistocles observing the inconvenience of the port Phalium, thought of making the Pyreneus the port of Athens. This he did not at first think proper to mention publicly; but having signified to the people that he had something of importance to communicate, they appointed Xanthippus and Arildides to judge of his proposal. They readily came into his measures, and told the people that what Themistocles proposed would be of the utmost advantage to the state, at the same time that it might be performed with ease. Upon this they were desired to lay the matter before the senate; who coming unanimously into their meetings, ambassadors were dispatched to Sparta to inform there how proper it would be for the Greeks to have some great port, where a fleet might always watch the designs of the Persians; and thus having prevented any umbrage from their first undertakings, the work was set about with such expedition, that it was finished before the Lacedemonians knew well what they were about.\n\nAt this time also the sovereignty of the sea was transferred from Sparta to Athens, through the haughty behaviour of Papianas the Lacedemonian. He had commanded at Platea, and still enjoyed the supreme authority in the war which was all this time carrying on against the Persians; but being elated with his success at Platea, and having entered into a treasonable correspondence with the enemy, he treated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> captains under his command with the greatest haughtiness, giving the preference to the Spartans in such a manner that the rest of the Greeks could no longer bear his insolence. On the contrary, Arildides, and Cimon the son of Miltiades, who commanded the Athenians, by their obliging behaviour gained the favour of every body; so that the allies, having publicly affronted Papianas, put themselves under the protection of the Athenian republic; and thenceforward the Athenians, and not the Lacedemonians, had the supreme command.\n\nThe Greeks being now sensible that they would always have occasion to be on their guard against the tax Persians, and that it was necessary to establish a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> with extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol6.html#article-TAXATION\">taxation</a> of all the states, Arildides was pitched upon as the only person that could be trusted with the power of allotting to each of the states its proper quota. This difficult task he undertook, and executed in a manner unparalleled in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANNALS\">annals</a> of history. All parties were pleased, and his taxation was styled the happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> of Greece. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> amount of it was 450 talents.\n\nIt now came to the turn of Themistocles to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> the ingratitude of his countrymen. His services had been so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a>, that the treatment he received may perhaps be a sufficient excuse for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> patriots when they connect their own interest with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of their country. Themistocles had plainly saved the state from ruin by his advice; he had distinguished himself by his valour; he had rendered Athens, by his policy, superior to the other states of Greece; and entirely subverted the Lacedemonian scheme of power. Yet notwithstanding all this, he was banished by the ostracism, without the smallest crime pretended, unless that he was hated by the Lacedemonians, and that he had erected a temple, near his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, dedicated to Diana, the giver of the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNSEL\">counsel</a>; intimating that he himself had given the best counsel for the safety both of Athens and of all Greece, which was no more than the truth. Nay, he was not only driven out of Athens, but out of all Greece; so that he was forced to seek shelter from the king of Persia, against whom he had fought with so much valour. That monarch gave him a gracious reception; and he was never recalled, because the Greeks had no occasion for his services.\n\nThe war with Persia was not yet discontinued; the Greeks found their advantage in plundering and enriching themselves with the spoils of the king of Persia's subjects. For this reason, in the end of the 77th Olympiad, they equipped a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>, under a pretence of relieving such of the Greek cities in Asia as were subject to the Persians. Of this fleet Cimon, the son of Miltiades by the daughter of the king of Thrace, was appointed commander in chief. He had already tasted the justice and generosity of his countrymen, having been thrown into prison for his father's fine, from which he was released by Callias, whom his sister Elpinice married on account of his great wealth procured by very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> means. He accepted of the command, however,\nAttica, however, and gained such immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOOTY\">booty</a> in this expedition, that the Athenians were thereby enabled to lay the foundation of those long extended walls which united the port to the city. The foundation was laid in a moorish ground; so that they were forced to sink it very deep, and at a great expense; but to this Cimon himself contributed out of his own share of the spoils, which was very considerable. He also adorned the forum with palm-trees, and beautified the academy with delightful walks and fountains.\n\nThe Persians having soon after this expedition invaded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHERSONESUS\">Chersonesus</a>, and with the assistance of the Thracians made themselves masters of it, Cimon was sent against them in a great hurry. He had only four ships; but nevertheless with these he took 13 of the Persian galleys, and reduced the whole of the Chersonesus. After this he marched against the Thracians, who revolting against the Athenians, had made themselves masters of the gold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> lying between the rivers Nysus and Strymon. The Thracians were quickly obliged to yield; after which the Athenians sent a great colony to Amphipolis, a city of Thrace, which for some time made a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, but afterwards attempting to penetrate into the country of the Edones, great part of them were destroyed.\n\nCimon also fell upon the following expedient to make Athens irresistible at sea by the other states of Greece. Many of the Greek states, by virtue of Aristides's taxation, were bound to furnish men and galleys as well as to pay the tax for their support. But when they saw themselves out of danger from the Persians, most of them were very unwilling to furnish their quota of men. This the Athenian generals being offended with, were for having recourse to force; but Cimon permitted such as were desirous of staying at home to do so, and accepted a sum of money in lieu of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GALLEY\">galley</a> completely manned. By this means he insured the Athenians, whom he took on board his galleys, to hardship and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>; while the allies who remained at home became enervated through idleness, and from being confederates, dwindled into tributaries, and almost slaves. In the last year of the 77th Olympiad, Cimon was sent to assist the Lacedemonians against their Helotes, who had revolted from them. In this he was attended with his usual success; but, some time after, the Lacedemonians being engaged in the siege of Ithome, sent again to the Athenians for succour; and Cimon was a second time sent to their relief; but the Spartans having received a sufficient supply of troops from other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> before the arrival of the Athenian general, he and his men were dismissed without doing anything. This grievously offended the people of Athens, who thenceforward hated not only the Lacedemonians, but all their own citizens who were thought to be friends to that state.\n\nIt was not possible, however, that any person who had served the state should escape banishment at Athens. Cimon had gained great wealth both to the public and to himself. In his public character he had behaved with unimpeached honesty, and as a private citizen he dedicated his wealth to the most excellent purposes. He demolished the enclosures about his grounds and gardens, permitting every one to enter and take what fruits they pleased; he kept an open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, where both rich and poor were plentifully entertained. If he met a citizen in a tattered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> of clothes, he made some of his attendants <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> with him; or if the quality of the person rendered that kindness undesirable, he caused a sum of money to be privately given him. All this, however, was not sufficient; he did not concur with every measure of the commonalty; and therefore the popular party determined not to banish him, but to put him to death. The crime laid to his charge was, that by presents from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MACEDONIANS\">Macedonians</a> he was prevailed upon to let slip a manifest opportunity of enlarging his conquests, after taking from the Persians the gold mines of Thrace. To this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a> Cimon replied, that to the utmost of his power he had prosecuted the war against the Thracians, and other enemies of the state of Athens; but that, it was true, he had not made any inroads into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MACEDONIA\">Macedonia</a>, because he did not imagine he was to act as a public enemy of mankind, and because he was struck with respect for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> modest in their carriage, just in their dealings, and strictly honourable in their behaviour towards him and the Athenians; that if his countrymen looked upon this as a crime, he must abide their judgment; but, for his part, he could never be brought to think such conduct amiss. Elpinice, Cimon's sister, used all her interest in his behalf, and amongst others spoke to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERICLES\">Pericles</a> the celebrated statesman and orator. He was indeed Cimon's rival, and had no doubt assisted in stirring up the prosecution against him; but he did not desire his death; and therefore, though appointed to accuse him, Pericles spoke in such a manner that it plainly appeared he did not think him guilty; and, in consequence of this lenity, Cimon was only banished by the ostracism.\n\nThe Athenian power was now risen to such a height, that all the other states of Peloponnesus looked upon this republic with a jealous eye, and were continually watching every opportunity of making war upon it when the state was engaged in troublesome affairs, and seemed to be less able to resist. These attempts, however, so far from lessening, generally contributed to increase, the power of the Athenians; but in the year before Christ 458, the republic entered into a war with Sparta, which was scarce put an end to but by the destruction of the city of Athens. For this war, there was no recent provocation on the part of the Spartans. They had sent a great army to assist the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DORIANS\">Dorians</a> against the Phocians, and the Athenians took this opportunity to revenge themselves of former quarrels. Having therefore drawn in the Argives and Thessalians to be their confederates, they posted themselves on the isthmus, so that the Spartan army could not return without engaging them. The Athenians and their confederates amounted to 14,000 and the Spartans to 11,500. The Spartan general, however, not very willing to hazard a battle, turned aside to Tanagra, a city in Boeotia, where some of the Athenians who inclined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOCRACY\">aristocracy</a> entered into a correspondence with him. But before their designs were ripe for execution, the Athenian army marched with great expedition to Tanagra, so that a battle became inevitable. When the armies were drawn up in order of battle, Cimon, presented himself before his countrymen in complete armour, and went to take part among those of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>, but the popular party raised such a clamour against him, that he was forced to retire. Before he departed, however, he exhorted Euthippus and the rest of his friends to behave in such a manner that they might\nmight wipe off the aspersion thrown upon him, as if he had designed to betray his country's cause to the Lacedemonians. Euthippus desired him to leave his armour, which he did; and a battle ensuing, the Athenians were defeated with great loss, and Euthippus with the rest of Cimon's friends were all killed in defence of his armour which they had surrounded. Another engagement soon followed, wherein both armies suffered so much, that they were glad to conclude a short truce, that each might have time to recruit their shattered forces.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> of fortune now seemed to turn in favour of the Athenians. The Thebans, who had been deprived of the command of Boeotia on account of their having sided with Xerxes, were now restored to it by the Lacedemonians. At this the Athenians were so dispirited, that they sent an army under Myronides the son of Callias into Boeotia to overturn all that had been done. That general was met by the Thebans and their allies, who composed a numerous and well-disciplined army. Nevertheless, though the Athenian army was but a handful in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of their enemies, Myronides gained a complete victory over the allies, in some fields more glorious than either that of Marathon or Plat\u00e6a. In these battles they had fought against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFEMINATE\">effeminate</a> and ill-disciplined Persians, but now they encountered and defeated a superior army composed of the bravest Greeks. After this victory, Myronides marched to Tanagra; which he took by storm, and razed to the ground; he then plundered Boeotia; defeated another army which the Boeotians had drawn together to oppose him; then fell upon the Locrians; and, having penetrated into Thessaly, chastised the inhabitants of that country for having revolted from the Athenians; and from thence returned to Athens <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with riches and glory.\n\nThe next year Tolmides the Athenian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a> invaded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LACONIA\">Laconia</a>, where he made himself master of several places; and on the back of this, Pericles invaded Peloponnesus with great success, burning, spoiling, or taking whatever places he attempted. On his return he found the people greatly out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> on account of Cimon's banishment; so he was immediately recalled.\n\nCimon was no sooner returned than he fell to his old employment of plundering the Persians; and, according to Plutarch, he had now nothing less in view than the conquest of the whole Persian empire. The Persian monarch finding he could have no rest, at last sent orders to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARTABAZUS\">Artabazus</a> and Megabizus, his commanders, to conclude a treaty; which was done on the following conditions: 1. That the Greek cities in Asia should be free, and governed by their own laws. 2. That the Persians should send no army within three days' journey of the sea. 3. That no Persian ship of war should sail between Thessaly and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CYRENE\">Cyrene</a>, the former a city of Pamphylia, and the latter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LYCIA\">Lycia</a>.\n\nWhile this treaty was carrying on Cimon died, whether of sickness or of a wound he had received is not known; and after his death the Athenian affairs began to fall into confusion. It was now the misfortune of this state to be alike hated by her enemies and allies; the consequence of which was, that the latter were perpetually revolting whenever they thought they had an opportunity of doing so with impunity. The Megarians, at this time, who had been long under the protection or dominion of Athens, thought proper for some reason or other to disclaim all dependence on their former protectors, and have recourse to Sparta, with which state they entered into a strict alliance. This the Athenians revenged by ravaging the country of the Megarians; which soon brought on a renewal of the Lacedemonian war that had been for a little time suspended. Pericles, however, procured the return of the first Lacedemonian army, without bloodshed, by bribing Chandricle the young king of Sparta's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a>. In the winter, Tolmides resolved to undertake an expedition into Boeotia with a small body of troops; which design he put in execution contrary to the advice of Pericles; and his rashness was soon punished by his own death and the total defeat of his army. Notwithstanding this misfortune, however, Pericles soon after invaded and reduced Euboea; and the Lacedemonians, years hence finding it was not for their interest to carry on the war, concluded a truce with the Athenians for thirty years.\n\nAbout this time Phammiticus, king of Egypt, sent by way of present to the people of Athens 40,000 bushels of wheat; which proved a great misfortune to the city: for Pericles, out of spite to Cimon, who had cruelly murdered his children by an Arcadian woman, had preferred a law whereby the Athenians of the half blood were disfranchised; and this law, on account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of the corn above-mentioned, was prosecuted with such severity, that no less than 3000 persons, who till then had been considered as free-men, were sold for slaves. This piece of cruelty has been of great service to the Athenians, as by means of it we know exactly the number of Athenian citizens, which at this time amounted to no more than 14,000 persons, though Athens was now aiming at no less than erecting an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> monarchy.\n\nSix years after the conclusion of the peace between Athens and Sparta, a war broke out between the Samians and Miletians about the city of Priene, seated under Mount Mycale in Ionia. How this war came to affect the Athenians is not certainly known; but, somehow or other, this republic was induced to take the part of the Miletians; and the island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMOS\">Samos</a> was reduced by Pericles, who established there a democracy, and left an Athenian garrison. He was no sooner gone, however, than the Samians, disliking their new form of government, drove out the garrison he had left; but Pericles, quickly returning, besieged and took their city, demolished their walls, and fined them of the whole expense of the war; part of which he obliged them to pay down, and took hostages for the remainder. When Pericles returned, he procured himself to be appointed to pronounce the public oration in honour of those who fell; which he did with such eloquence, that when he came down from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULPIT\">pulpit</a> the women gathered about him, took him by the hand, and crowned him with garlands.\n\nA little after this commenced the war between the Corcyrians and Corinthians, which by degrees brought the Athenians into those engagements that proved the ruin of their state. The causes of this war were the following. An intestine war breaking out in the little territory of Epidamnum, a city of Macedonia founded by the Corcyrians, one party called in to their assistance\nThe latter neglecting the matter, Corinth was applied to, as the Corcyrians were a colony from that place. The Corinthians, partly out of pity to the Epidamnians, and partly out of spleen to the Corcyrians, sent a very great fleet to the afflaintance of the former, by which means that party which had applied to Corinth was thoroughly established. This being refused by the Corcyrians, they sent a fleet to Epidamnum to support the exiles; and accordingly this fleet began to act offensively on its entering the port, the chief commanders having instructions to propose terms of accommodation, to which the Corinthians would by no means agree. The next year the Corcyrians defeated at sea the Corinthians and their allies, and took Epidamnum by storm; after which they waited the territories of the allies of the Corinthians, which greatly exasperated the latter. At Corinth, therefore, they began to make great preparations for carrying on the war, and pressed their confederates to do the same, that they might be in a condition to retrieve the honour they had lost, and humble this ungrateful colony which had thus insulted her mother city.\n\nThe Corcyrians were no sooner acquainted with these proceedings, than they despatched ambassadors to Athens with their complaints; and these were quickly followed by others from Corinth on the same errand. At first the people of Athens inclined to favour the Corinthians; but they soon changed their minds, and took part with the Corcyrians: they contented themselves, however, with entering into a defensive alliance with that little state, whereby they promised to assist each other, in case either party should be attacked; and in consequence of this treaty, they furnished the Corcyrians with ten galleys, under Lacedaemonius the son of Cimon, with whom were joined Diotenes and Proteus as colleagues.\n\nAs soon as the season of the year permitted, the Corinthians sailed for the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORCYRA\">Corcyra</a> with a fleet of 150 ships, under the command of Xenocles, assisted by four other Corinthian admirals; each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUADRON\">squadron</a> of their allies being commanded by a chief of their own. The Corcyrian and Athenian fleet amounted to 120, but the Athenians had orders to give as little assistance as possible. The action was very brisk for some time: the Corcyrian right wing broke the left of the Corinthian fleet; and forcing some of the ships on shore, landed, pillaged their camp, and made a great number of them prisoners: on the other hand, the Corinthian ships in the right wing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> the Corcyrian ships there, they being but very faintly assisted by the Athenians, till the latter were at last obliged to defend themselves, which they did so well, that the Corinthians were glad to retire. The next day preparations were made on both sides for another engagement; but 20 ships coming from Athens to the afflaintance of the Corcyrians, the Corinthians declined the combat.\n\nAs soon as the Corcyrian war broke out, the Athenians sent orders to the citizens of Potidaea to demolish a part of their wall, to send back the magistrates they had received from Corinth, and to give hostages for their own behaviour. Potidaea was a town in Macedonia, founded by the Corinthians, but at that time in alliance with the Athenians.\u2014Perdiccas king of Macedon, who hated the Athenians, took this opportunity to persuade the Potidaeans to revolt. Accordingly they sent ambassadors to Athens to entreat the revocation of these orders; but at the same time sent deputies to Sparta, to join with the Corinthians and Megarians in their complaints against the Athenians. The Athenians upon this sent a considerable fleet against Potidaea, under the command of Calias, a nobleman of great courage. The Corinthians on their part despatched one Aristeus with a considerable body of troops to the afflaintance of that city. An engagement following, the Athenians were victors, but with the loss of their general Phormio, who succeeded in the command, invested the city in form, and shut up its port with his fleet; but the Potidaeans dreading to fall into the hands of the Athenians, made a most obstinate defence, while in the mean time they warmly solicited the Corinthians to perform their promises, and engage the rest of the states of Peloponnese in their quarrel.\n\nThe Lacedemonians having heard what the Corinthians and other little states of Greece had to say against the Athenians, sent ambassadors to the latter, demanding reparation for the injuries, with orders, in the event of a refusal, to declare war. The terms demanded were, in the first place, the expulsion of those Athenians who were allied to the family of Megacles often mentioned. This article was on account of Pericles; for he was the son of Xanthippus the Athenian commander at Mycale by Agariste <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIECE\">niece</a> to the famous Clysthenes, who corrupted the priesthoods of Apollo in order to procure the expulsion of the Pisistratids. They next insisted that the siege of Potidaea should be raised; thirdly, that the inhabitants of Aegina should be left free; and lastly, that a decree made against the Megarians, whereby they were forbidden the ports and markets of Athens, should be revoked, and all the Grecian states under the dominion of Athens set at liberty.\n\nThese terms the Athenians were persuaded by Pericles to reject. The arguments used by him were in substance as follows: That whatever the Lacedemonians might pretend as to the justice of the complaints of the allies, the true ground of this resentment was the prosperity of the Athenian republic, which the Spartans always hated, and now sought an opportunity of humbling: that it must be owing to the Athenians themselves if this design succeeded, because for many reasons Athens was better able to engage in a long and expensive war than the Peloponnesians. He then laid before the people an exact account of their circumstances; putting them in mind, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> brought from Delos amounted to 10,000 talents; and that though 4000 of these had been expended on the stately gate of their citadel, yet that 6000 were still in hand; that they were also entitled to the subsidies paid by the confederate states; that the statues of their gods, the Persian spoils, &c., were worth immense sums; that private men were arrived at vast fortunes; and that, considering their trade by sea, they had a certain annual increase of wealth; that they had on foot an army of 12,000 men, and in their colonies and garrisons 17,000; that their fleet consisted of 300 sail; whereas the Peloponnesians had no such advantages. For these reasons he proposed as the most feasible and likewise\nlikewise the most equitable satisfaction that could be given, that they would reverse their decree against Megara, if the Lacedemonians would allow free egress and regres in their city to the Athenians and their allies; that they would leave all those states free who were free at the making of the last peace with Sparta, provided the Spartans would also leave all states free who were under their dominion; and that future disputes should be submitted to arbitration. In case these offers should be rejected, he advised them to hazard a war, telling them, that they should not think they ran that hazard for a trifle, or retain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SCRUPLE\">scruple</a> in their minds as if a small matter moved them to it, because on this small matter depended their safety, and the reputation of their confiancy and resolution; whereas, if they yielded in this, the next demand of the Lacedemonians would be of a higher nature; for having once discovered that the Athenians were subject to fear, they would thence conclude that nothing could be denied to Sparta; whereas a stiff denial in this case would teach them to treat Athens for the future on terms of equality. He enforced these reasons by showing that their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> had always acted on the like principles, and in all cases preferred their glory to their ease, and their liberty to their possessions.\n\nThis was the origin of the Peloponnesian war, which makes so great a figure in ancient history. The immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> to general hostilities was an attempt of the Thebans to surprise Platea. With this view they sent Eurymachus with 300 Thebans to afflit such of the Plateans as they had drawn over to their interest, in making themselves masters of the place. In this design they succeeded very well at first, the Plateans, who had promised to open the gates, keeping their words exactly, so that they were instantly in possession of the city. The other party, however, perceiving how small a number they had to contend with, unanimously rose upon them, killed a great many, and forced the rest to surrender themselves prisoners of war. Another party came from Thebes to assist their countrymen; but they arrived too late: the Plateans, however, foreseeing that they would waste their country, promised to release their prisoners if they would forbear to spoil their lands. On this the Thebans withdrew; and the Plateans cruelly put to death all their prisoners, to the number of 180, with Eurymachus their chief, alleging that they had not promised their release but in case of peace. The Athenians, as soon as they had notice of this attempt of the Thebans, caused all the Boeotians in their territory to be arrested; and when they understood how the Plateans had delivered themselves, they sent a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVOY\">convoy</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> to that city, and a numerous body of troops to escort their wives and children to Athens.\n\nBoth parties now prepared in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> for war, both sent ambassadors to the Persians, and both fought to rouse their allies. Most of the Greek states inclined to favour the Spartans, because they acted on this occasion as the deliverers of Greece, and because they either had been, or feared that they would be, oppressed by the Athenians. With the Spartans joined all the Peloponnesians, except the Argives and part of the Arcadians; without Peloponnesus, the Megarians, Phocians, Locrians, Boeotians, Ambraciots, Leucadians, and Anaforians, declared themselves on their side. On the other hand, the Chians, Lesbians, Plateans, Mefenians, Acarnanians, Corcyrians, Zacynthians, Carianians, Dorians, Thracians, most part of the islands, and all the Cyclades excepting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELOS\">Melos</a> and Thera, with Euboea and Samos, joined the Athenians.\n\nThe Peloponnesian war commenced 431 years before Christ. The Lacedemonian army was assembled at the isthmus, and consisted of no less than 60,000 men; but before Archidamus king of Sparta, who commanded in chief, would enter Attica, he despatched a herald to Athens. The herald was sent back without any answer, by which all hopes of peace were cut off. As Archidamus was a friend to Pericles, the latter apprehended that he might forbear plundering his estates. With this he immediately acquainted the people; telling them at the same time, that in such a case he made a present of his lands to the public. He then advised the citizens to take no care of defending their country-lands, but to attend only to the city, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> themselves in the equipping of ships, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> a thorough reformation not to be intimidated with the first evils of war. This proposal the Athenians readily complied with, and appointed Pericles commander in chief, with nine more generals to assist him.\n\nThe first year, the Spartan army committed great ravages in Attica, Pericles having no force capable of opposing it, and refusing to engage on disadvantageous terms, notwithstanding prodigious clamours were raised against him by his countrymen. The allies, however, had no great reason to boast of the advantages they gained this year: an Athenian fleet ravaged the coasts of Peloponnesus; another infested the Locrians, drove out the inhabitants of Aegina, and repeopled the island from Athens. They likewise reduced Cephalenia, and some towns in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACARNANIA\">Acarnania</a> and Leucas which had declared for the Lacedemonians; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a>, when the Peloponnesians were retired, Pericles entering the Megarian territory, did all the mischief that could be expected from a provoked enemy.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> of the second year was very fatal to Athenians by a dreadful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> which destroyed great numbers of the citizens, while the Peloponnesians under Archidamus waited every thing abroad. In the midst of these distresses, however, Pericles retained his courage, and would suffer none of his countrymen to flit without the city either to escape the plague or infect the enemy. He caused a great fleet to be equipped, on board which he embarked 4000 foot and 300 horse, with which he sailed to Epidaurus. Upon this the enemy withdrew their forces out of Attica; but Pericles was able to do no great matter on account of the plague, which made so great havoc among his men, that he brought back to Athens only 1500 of the 4000 he carried out. By this misfortune the Athenians were thrown into despair; they immediately sued for peace, for which the Spartans were now too proud to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a>; then turning their rage upon Pericles, they dismissed and fined him. Soon after, Pericles's children and almost all his relations died of the plague; so that this great statesman was overwhelmed with melancholy, and for some time shut himself up from public view: at last, through the persuasion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALCIBIADES\">Alcibiades</a> and some others, he showed himself to the people. They received him with acclamations, and at his request repealed the unjust\nAttica just law he had made, whereby all Athenians of the half blood were distranchiled, and then reinstituted him in all his former honours. Hereupon he enrolled the only son he had left, who before had been counted a bastard on account of his mother being a Milesian.\n\nThis year also the island of Zacynthus was waited by the Peloponnesians; and the city of Potidea submitted to the Athenians, after the inhabitants had been driven to such extremity as to feed upon human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>. The Athenians permitted the men to depart with one garment, and the women with two; after which, the town was repeopled by a colony from Athens.\n\nThe third year of the Peloponnesian war was remarkable for the death of the great Pericles, who was taken off by the plague. Platea also was besieged by Archidamus; but without success, even though the greatest part of it was set on fire; the Plateans refusing to submit to every kind of misery rather than abandon the Athenian cause. In the end, therefore, the king of Sparta was obliged to turn the siege into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLOCKADE\">blockade</a>; and having thrown up an intrenchment fortified with a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DITCH\">ditch</a>, he left a sufficient number of men to guard his lines, and then returned back to Peloponnesus.\n\nThe following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, the Peloponnesians under the command of Archidamus invaded Attica, where they waited everything with fire and sword; at the same time the whole island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LESBOS\">Lesbos</a>, except the district of Methymna, revolted from the Athenians, who hereupon invested the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MITYLENE\">Mitylene</a>. All this time the city of Platea was blocked up by the Peloponnesians; and its inhabitants being now greatly distressed for want of provisions, the garrison, consisting of 400 natives and 80 Athenians, came to the desperate resolution of forcing a passage through the enemy's lines. When they came to attempt this, however, many of them were intimidated; but 300 persisted in their resolution; and of these 212 got safe through and marched to Athens, but the rest were compelled to retire.\n\nIn the beginning of the fifth year, the Peloponnesians sent 40 ships to the relief of Mitylene; but without effect, for the place had surrendered before the fleet could come to its assistance. Paches, the Athenian commander, likewise chafed away the Peloponnesian fleet upon its arrival; and returning to Lesbos sent the Lacedemonian minister, whom he found in Mitylene, together with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTATION\">deputation</a>, to Athens. On their arrival, the Lacedemonian was immediately put to death; and in a general assembly of the people, it was resolved, that all the Mitylenians who were arrived at man's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> should be put to death, and the women and children sold for slaves. The next day, however, this cruel decree was reversed, and a galley sent with all expedition to countermand the bloody orders. This last vessel, however, could not get before the other; but Paches, being a man of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, had taken a day to consider on the orders he had received; during which time the last mentioned galley arrived; in consequence of which, only about 1000 of the most forward rebels were put to death; the walls of the city were also demolished, their ships taken away, and their lands divided among the Athenians, who let them again to their old masters at very high rents. The same summer the Athenians seized the island of Minos, lying over against the territory of Megara; and likewise the port of Nisaea, which last they fortified, and it proved afterwards a place of the utmost importance to them. At this time also the Plat\u00e6ans, driven to the last extremity, surrendered to the Lacedemonians, by whom they were, to the number of 208, including 25 Athenians, put to death, and their women sold for slaves. Their city was soon after razed by their implacable enemies the Thebans, who left only an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INN\">inn</a> to show where it stood. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of Plat\u00e6a, however, induced Alexander the Great afterwards to rebuild it.\n\nIn this year happened the famous sedition of Corcyra, whence other seditions, when their effects resembled them terrible, have been called Corcyrian. It hath been already observed, that the war between the Corcyrians and Corinthians brought on the general war throughout Peloponnesus. A great number of Corcyrians were in the beginning of this war carried away prisoners into Peloponnesus, where the chief of them were very well treated, but the rest sold for slaves. The reason of this conduct of the Corinthians was a design they had formed of engaging these Corcyrians to influence their countrymen to hide with them and their allies. With this view they treated them with all imaginable lenity and tenderness, infilling into them by degrees an hatred of democratic government; after which they were told, that they might obtain their liberty upon condition of using all their influence at home in favour of the allies, and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> of Athens. This the Corcyrians readily promised and endeavoured to perform. At first, those who were for an aristocracy prevailed, and murdered all those of the opposite party that fell into their hands, in which they were assisted by a fleet of Peloponnesians: but the Athenians sending first one fleet and then another to the assistance of the distressed party, the Peloponnesians were forced to withdraw; after which the democratic party sufficiently revenged themselves, and destroyed their antagonists without mercy. The worst of all was, that this example once set, the several states of Greece felt in their turns the like commotions, which were always heightened by agents from Sparta and Athens; the former endeavouring to settle aristocracy, and the latter democracy, wherever they came.\n\nWhile the Athenians were thus engaged in a war wherein they were already overmatched, they foolishly engaged in a new one, which in the end proved more fatal than all the rest. The inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a> were split into two factions; the one called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DORIC\">Doric</a>, at the head of which was the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a>; the other the Ionic, which owned the Leontines for their chiefs; the latter perceiving themselves too weak without foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a>, sent one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEORGIA\">Georgia</a>, a celebrated orator, to apply to Athens for relief; and he by his fine speeches captivated the giddy and inconstant Athenians, that they ran headlong into a war which they were unable to maintain while engaged with all the Peloponnesians. Enticed by this new prospect, therefore, and grasping at the conquest of Sicily, as well as of all Greece, they sent a fleet to the assistance of the Leontines, under the command of Lachetes and Chabrias; and they were no sooner failed, than another fleet for the same purpose was begun to be fitted out. All this time the plague continued to rage with great violence at Athens, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> off this year 4000 citizens, besides...\nAttica. sides a much greater number of the meaner sort of people.\n\nThe sixth year of the Peloponnesian war was remarkable for no great exploit; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGIS\">Agis</a> the son of Archidamus, king of Sparta, assembled an army in order to invade Attica, but was prevented from doing so by many great earthquakes which happened throughout Greece. The next year, however, he entered Attica with his army, while the Athenians on their part sent a fleet under the command of Demothenes, to infest the coasts of Peloponnesus. As this fleet passed by Laconia, the commander took notice that the promontory of Pylus, which was joined to the continent by a narrow neck of land, had before it a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARREN_ISLAND\">barren island</a> about two miles in circumference, in which, however, there was a good and safe port, all winds being kept off by the headland, or by the isle. These advantages made him apprehend, that a garrison left here would give the Peloponnesians so much trouble, that they would find it more advisable to protect their own country than to invade that of their neighbours. Accordingly, having raised a strong fortification, he himself with five ships sailed to defend it, while the rest of the fleet proceeded on their intended expedition. On the news of this event, the Peloponnesian army immediately returned to besiege Pylus. When they arrived before the place they took possession of the harbour, and then caused a chosen body of Spartans take possession of the island of Sphacteria, after which they attacked the fort with great vigour. Demothenes and his garrison defended themselves with great valour; and an Athenian fleet arriving very seasonably, offered battle to the Peloponnesian fleet. This being refused, the Athenians boldly sailed into the harbour, broke and sunk most of the vessels therein, after which they besieged the Spartans in Sphacteria. The Peloponnesians now began to treat with their enemies, and a truce was concluded during the time that negotiations were carried on at Athens. One of the articles of this truce was, that the Peloponnesians should deliver up all their ships, on condition of having them punctually returned in case the treaty did not take effect. The Athenians having heard the Spartan ambassadors, were inclined to put an end to this destructive war; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLEON\">Cleon</a>, one of their orators, a warm and obstinate man, persuaded his countrymen to insist on very unreasonable terms; upon which the ambassadors returned, and by doing so put an end to the truce. The Peloponnesians then demanded their vessels; but the Athenians refused to deliver them, under pretence of their having broken the truce.\n\nHostilities being thus recommenced on both sides, the Lacedemonians attacked the Athenians at Pylus, while the latter attacked the Spartans at Sphacteria. The Spartans, though but a handful of men and under every imaginable discouragement, behaved with such bravery, that the siege proceeded very slowly, so that the people of Athens became very uneasy. They began then to wish they had embraced the offers of the Spartans, and to rally vehemently against Cleon, who, to excuse himself, said, it would be easy for the general of the forces they were at that time sending, to attack the Spartans in the isle, and reduce them at once. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NICIAS\">Nicias</a>, who had been appointed to this command, replied, that if Cleon believed he could do such great things, he would do well to go thither in person; the latter, imagining this only meant to try him, said he was ready to go with all his heart; whereby Nicias caught him, and declared that he had relinquished his charge. Cleon thereupon said, that he was no general; but Nicias told him that he might become one; and the people, pleased with the controversy, held the orator to his word. Cleon then advancing, told them he was so little afraid of the enemy, that, with a very inconsiderable force, he would undertake, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> with those already at Pylus, to bring to Athens the Spartans who gave them so much trouble in 20 days. The people laughed at these promises; however, they furnished him with the troops he desired; and to these they surpried, Cleon brought the Spartans prisoners to the place Athens within the time appointed.\n\nThis summer, likewise, an Athenian fleet was sent to Sicily, with instructions to put in at Corcyra, and assist the government against the Lacedemonian faction which still subsisted in that island. This they effectually performed; for by their means the exiles fell into the hands of the other party: these they imprisoned; and then drew them out by 20 at a time, to suffer death, which was inflicted with all the circumstances of cruelty that party-rage could suggest. When only 60 remained, they entreated the Athenians to put them to death, and not to deliver them up to their countrymen; but upon this the Corcyrians surrounded the place where they were confined, endeavouring to bury them under their darts; upon which the unhappy captives all put an end to their own lives.\n\nIn the eighth year Nicias reduced the isle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CYTHERA\">Cythera</a> on the coast of Laconia; as likewise Thyrrea, on the confines of that country. The latter had been given to the \u00c6ginetans when expelled from their own country by the Athenians; and they were now condemned to death, as inveterate enemies of the Athenian state and nation.\u2014In Sicily, one Hermocrates of Syracuse persuaded all the inhabitants of the island to adjust their differences among themselves; upon which the Athenian generals returned home, and for so doing two of them were banished, and the third sentenced to pay a heavy fine.\n\nThe Athenians next laid siege to Megara under the conduct of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a> and Demothenes; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASIDAS\">Brasidas</a> a Spartan general coming to its relief, a battle ensued, by which, though neither party got the better, the Lacedemonian faction prevailed in Megara, and many who favoured the Athenians were forced to withdraw. After this, such as had been banished for adhering to the Lacedemonians were allowed to return, on their taking an oath to forget what was past, and attempt nothing that might disturb their country. As soon as they were settled, however, they forgot their oath; and causing 100 of those who were most obnoxious to be apprehended, forced the people to condemn them to death. They then changed the whole form of government, introduced an oligarchy, and policed themselves of the supreme power.\n\nIn Boeotia some commotions were raised in favour of the Athenians; but their generals Hippocrates and Demothenes being defeated by the opposite party, all power in hopes ceased of the Athenian power being established in Boeotia. In the mean time Brasidas reduced the city of Amphipolis, which greatly alarmed the Athenians,\nAtticaans, who thereupon sent new supplies of men, money, and ships to the Macedonian coast; but all their care could not prevent a great defection from their interest in those parts, where the valour and conduct of Brasidas carried all before him.\n\nIn the ninth year, the Spartans made new proposals of peace, which the Athenians were now more inclined to accept than formerly; and finding their affairs very much unsettled by the loss of Amphipolis, a truce for a year was quickly agreed on, while negotiations were in the mean time carrying on for a general peace. This pacific scheme, however, was very soon overthrown by the following accident in Thrace. The city of Scione, and that of Menda, revolted to Brasidas; who, knowing nothing of the truce, fought to draw over Potidea also. The Athenians, pretending that Scione revolted two days after the truce was concluded, made heavy complaints, asserting that this was a breach of the truce, and that both it and Menda should be restored to them. This not being effected by negotiations, an army was sent against the two cities, by which Menda was reduced; but Scione making an obstinate defence, the siege was turned into a blockade.\n\nIn the tenth year, Brasidas made an attempt upon Potidea; which having failed, the Athenians began to recover some courage. The truce expiring on the day of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PYTHIAN_GAMES\">Pythian games</a>, Cleon persuaded the Athenians to send an army into Thrace under his own command. It consisted of 1200 foot and 300 horse, all Athenian citizens, who embarked on board 30 galleys. Brasidas had an army much inferior; but observing that the Athenian general was become careless, and neglected discipline, he attacked him. In this engagement Cleon was killed, and the Athenians were defeated with the loss of 600 men, while the Spartans lost only seven; but among these was their brave commander Brasidas, whose death affected them almost as much as the loss of their army did the Athenians.\n\nAs the death of Cleon deprived the Athenians of one of their best speakers, and one who had been very industrious in promoting the war, they were now much more disposed than formerly to hearken to terms of accommodation. Amongst the Spartans, too, there was a party, at the head of whom was Platontax their king, who earnestly wished for peace; and as Nicias laboured no less assiduously at Athens to bring about this desirable event, a peace was at last concluded for fifty years between the two nations. The conditions were, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESTITUTION\">restitution</a> of places and prisoners should be made on both sides; excepting that Niseca should remain to the Athenians, who had taken it from the Megarians, and that Platea should continue with the Thebans, because they absolutely would not give it up. The Boeotians, Corinthians, and Megarians, refused to be included in this peace; but the rest of the allies yielded to it; and it was accordingly ratified, receiving the name of the Nician peace, from Nicias who had so vigorously promoted it.\n\nBy this means, however, tranquillity was far from being restored. Such of the states of Peloponnesus as were dissatisfied, began immediately to league among themselves, and to set on foot a new confederacy, the head of which was to be the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARGOS\">Argos</a>. The Lacedemonians, too, found it impossible to perform ex-\n\nVol. III. Part I.\nracy against his countrymen: perceiving, however, that the reduction of the island would be a work of time, he left a considerable body of forces there, and returned to Athens. In his absence the capital of Melos surrendered at discretion, and the inhabitants were treated with the utmost cruelty: all the men capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> arms being slaughtered, and the women and children carried into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a>.\n\nIn the beginning of the 17th year, Nicias was appointed commander of an expedition against the Syracusans, along with Alcibiades and Lamachus as colleagues. But while the necessary preparations were making, all things were thrown into confusion by the defacing of the Hermae, or statues of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a>, of which there was a great number in the city. The authors of this sacrilege could by no means be discovered, though rewards were offered for this purpose: at last the suspicion fell upon Alcibiades; and for this weighty reason he was commanded to return from Sicily to take his trial. Alcibiades, however, knew the temper of his countrymen too well to trust himself to their mercy; and therefore, instead of returning to Athens, he fled immediately to Sparta, where he met with a gracious reception; while the infatuated Athenians were severely punished by the loss of their army, generals, and fleet, in Sicily, which the superior abilities of Alcibiades would in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> have prevented.\n\nThe 19th and 20th years of the war were spent by the Athenians in equipping a new fleet in order to repair their vast losses: but Alcibiades hurt their interests very much, by persuading Tissaphernes the Persian to league with the Spartans against them; at the same time he persuaded several of the Ionian states to revolt from Athens, but they were in a short time obliged again to submit. Notwithstanding all these services, however, Alcibiades had rendered himself so hateful to Agis by debauching his wife, that he soon found himself obliged to fly to the Persians, where Tissaphernes gave him a very favourable reception, and profited much by his advice, which was, to let the Greeks weaken one another by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> wars, and that the Persians ought never to see one state totally destroyed, but always to support the weaker party.\n\nWhen Tissaphernes had acquiesced with these counsels, Alcibiades privately wrote to some of the officers in the Athenian army at Samos, that he had been treating with the Persians in behalf of his countrymen, but did not choose to return till the democracy should be abolished; and to incline the citizens to comply with this measure, he told them that the Persian king disliked a democracy, but would immediately assist them if that was abolished, and an oligarchy erected in its stead.\n\nOn the arrival of Pisander and other deputies from the army, with the proposals of Alcibiades, the Athenians without hesitation resolved to overturn that democracy which they had all along so strenuously defended. The issue of their present debate was, that Pisander with ten deputies should return to Alcibiades, in order to know on what terms the king of Persia would make an alliance with them; but that running Athenian having perceived that Tissaphernes was by no means disposed to assist the Athenians on account of their having been lately successful, he set up such high demands in the king of Persia's name, that the Athenians of themselves broke off the treaty, and thus Alcibiades preserved the friendship of both parties.\n\nPisander having engaged the army at Samos in his scheme of overturning democracy, that form of government was abolished first in the cities subject to Athens, and lastly in the capital itself. Pisander's new form scheme was, That the old form of government should be totally dissolved; that five prytanes should be elected; that these five should choose 100; and that each of the hundred should choose three; that the 400 thus elected should become a senate with full power; but should occasionally consult with 5000 of the most wealthy citizens, who should thenceforward be esteemed only the people; and that no authority should remain with the lowest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>. Though the people were not very fond of this change, those who conducted it, being men of great parts, found means to establish it by force; for when the people were gone out of the city to their ordinary employments, the 400, having each a dagger concealed under his vest, attended by a guard of 120 men, entered the senate-house, dissolved the old senate, and without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> turned them out; after which the commons, not knowing whom to submit to, or to whom to apply, made no opposition.\n\nThe first step of the new governors was to destroy all their enemies; who, however, were not very numerous, so that little blood was shed. They next sent ambassadors to Agis to sue for peace; but he, taking for granted that the Athenians would never defend an oligarchy, gave no answer to the ambassadors, but immediately marched towards the capital with a design to attack it. On his arrival, however, he was quickly convinced of his mistake, being repulsed with loss, and obliged to retire to his old post.\n\nIn the mean time the Athenian army declared again for a democracy; and having recalled Alcibiades, in declare vested him with full power, and insisted on his immediate return to Athens to restore the ancient government. This measure he refused to comply with, and instead persuaded them to stay where they were, in order to save Ionia: he also prevailed on them to allow some deputies, who had been sent from the new governors of Athens, to come and deliver their message. To these deputies Alcibiades replied, that they should immediately return to Athens, and acquaint the 400, that they were commanded immediately to resign their power and restore the senate; but that the 5000 might retain theirs, provided they used it with moderation.\n\nBy this answer the city was thrown into the utmost Great confusion; but the new government party prevailing, confusion ambassadors were despatched to Sparta with orders to procure peace on any terms. This, however, was not to be effected; and Phrynicus, the head of the embassy, and likewise of the new government party, was murdered on his return. After his death, Theramenes, the head of the other party, seized the chiefs of the 400; upon which a tumult ensued that had almost proved fatal to the city itself. The mob, however, being at last dispersed, the 400 assembled, though in great fear, and sent deputies to the people, promising to set all things to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a>. In consequence of this deputation,\nAttica. A day was appointed for convoking a general assembly, and settling the state; but when that day came, news was brought that the Lacedemonian fleet appeared in view, and steered directly for Salamis. Thus all was again thrown into confusion; for the people, instead of deliberating on the subject proposed, ran in crowds down to the port, and perceiving the Spartans made towards Euboea, a fleet of 36 ships was immediately dispatched under the command of Thymochares, to engage the enemy. This fleet was utterly defeated, 22 of the Athenian ships being taken, and most of the others sunk or disabled; but what was worse, this defeat was followed by the revolt of all the country of Euboea except Orcus.\n\nWhen these dismal tidings arrived at Athens, everything was given up for lost; and had the Lacedemonians taken this opportunity of attacking the city, they had undoubtedly succeeded, and thus put an end to the war: but being at all times slow, especially in naval affairs, they gave the Athenians time to equip a new fleet, and to retrieve their affairs. One good effect of this disaster, however, was the putting an end for a time to the internal divisions of this turbulent people; insomuch that Thucydides the historian is of opinion, that the republic never enjoyed so much quiet as at this time.\n\nAlcibiades now showed his abilities and inclination to serve his country in an eminent manner. By his intrigues he so effectually embroiled the Persians and Peloponnesians with each other, that neither party knew whom to trust. Thrasybulus, with 55 ships, gained a victory over the Peloponnesian fleet consisting of 73; after which he took 8 galleys coming from Byzantium; which city had revolted from the Athenians, but was soon after taken, and the inhabitants severely fined. The fleet being afterwards joined by Alcibiades, nine more of the Peloponnesian galleys were taken, the Haliarnassians were constrained to pay a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> sum of money, and Cos was strongly fortified; which transactions ended the 21st year of the Peloponnesian war.\n\nIn the succeeding years of this famous war, the Athenians had at first great advantages. Thrasybulus gained a signal victory at sea; and Alcibiades gained two victories, one by sea and another by land, in one day; took the whole Peloponnesian fleet, and more spoil than his men could carry away. The Spartans were now humbled in their turn, and sued for peace; but the Athenians were so intoxicated with their success, that they sent back the ambassadors without an answer; which they soon had sufficient reason to repent of. The beginning of the Athenian misfortunes was the taking of Pylus by the Spartans. The Athenians had sent a fleet under the command of one Anytus to its defence; but he was driven back by contrary winds; upon which he was condemned to death, because he could not cause the wind blow from what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> he pleased: this sentence, however, was remitted on his paying a vast sum of money. This misfortune was quickly followed by another. The Megarians surprized Nysaea; which enraged the Athenians so much, that they immediately sent an army into that country, who defeated the Megarians who opposed them with great slaughter, and committed horrid devastations.\n\nThese misfortunes as yet, however, were overbalanced by the great actions of Alcibiades, Thrasybulus, and Theramenes. When Alcibiades returned, he brought with him a fleet of 200 ships, and such a load of spoils as had never been seen in Athens since the then conclusion of the Persian war. The people left their city destitute, that they might crowd to the port, to behold Alcibiades as he landed; old and young bleated him as he passed; and next day when he made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARANGUE\">harangue</a> to the assembly, they directed the record of his banishment to be thrown into the sea, absolved him from the curses he lay under, and created him general with full power. Nor did he seem inclined to indulge himself in ease, but soon put to sea again with a fleet of 100 ships. He had not been long gone, however, graced before all this was forgot. Alcibiades sailed to the Hellespont with part of his fleet, leaving the rest under the command of Antiochus his pilot, but with strict orders to attempt nothing before his return. This command the pilot paid no regard to, but provoked Lygander the Lacedemonian admiral to an engagement, and in consequence of his temerity was defeated with the loss of 15 ships, himself being killed in the engagement. On the news of this defeat Alcibiades returned, and endeavoured to provoke the Lacedemonians to a second battle; but this Lygander prudently declined; and in the mean time the Athenians, with unparalleled ingratitude and inconstancy, deprived Alcibiades of his command, naming ten new generals in his room.\n\nThis was the last step the Athenians had to take for the Athenians gaining command, was defeated by Callicratides, Lygander's successor; but being afterwards strongly reinforced, put fix of the Lacedemonians were entirely defeated with the loss of 77 ships. Such a victory might at this time have inspired the Athenians with some kind of gratitude toward the generals who granted it; but instead of this, or pretence of their not having assisted the wounded during the engagement, eight of them were recalled; two were wise enough not to return; and the six who trusted to the justice of their country were all put to death.\n\nThe next year Lygander was appointed commander of what fleet the Peloponnesians had left, with which he took Thasus and Lampacus. Conon was despatched against him with 180 ships, which being greatly superior to Lygander's fleet, that general refused to come to an engagement, and was blocked up in the river \u00c6gus. While the Athenians lay there, they grew quite idle and careless; insomuch that Alcibiades, who had built a castle for himself in the neighbourhood, entreated them to be more on their guard, as he well knew Lygander's abilities. They answered, that they wondered at his assurance, who was an exile and a vagabond, to come and give laws to them; telling him, that if he gave them any farther trouble, they would seize and send him to Athens. At the same time they looked on victory as so certain, that they consulted what they should do with their prisoners; which, by the advice of Philocles their general, was to cut off all their right hands, or, according to Plutarch, their right thumbs; and Adiamantus one of their officers rendered himself very obnoxious by saying, that such idle discourse did not become Athenians. The consequences\nconsequences of such conduct may be easily imagined. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LYCAON\">Lycaon</a> fell unexpectedly upon them, and gained a most complete victory; Conon, with eight galleys only, escaping to Cyprus; after which Lycaon returned to Lampacus, where he put to death Philocles with 3000 of his soldiers, and all the officers except Adiamantus. This execution being over, he reduced all the cities subject to Athens; and with great civility sent home their garrisons, that so the city might be overstocked with inhabitants, and destitute of provisions, when he came to besiege it; which he did soon after by sea, while Agis, with a great army, invested it by land.\n\nFor a long time the Athenians did not so much as desire a peace; but at last were forced to send deputies to Agis, who sent them to Sparta, where no terms could be granted except they consented to demolish their walls. They next sent to Lycaon, who after a long attendance referred them to Sparta; and thither Theramenes with some other deputies was immediately sent. On their arrival, they found the council of the confederates sitting, who all except the Spartans gave their votes that Athens should be utterly destroyed; but they would not consent to the ruin of that city, which had deserved so well of Greece. On the return of Theramenes, peace was concluded, on condition, that the long walls and the fortifications of the port should be demolished; that they should give up all their ships but 12, receive all they had banished, and follow the fortune of the Lacedemonians. These terms were punctually executed. Lycaon caused the walls to be pulled down, all the music in his army playing, on that very day of the year on which they had beat the Persians at Salamis. He likewise established an oligarchy expressly against the will of the people; and thus the ruin of Athens ended the 27th year of the Peloponnesian war, and the 404th before Christ.\n\nAs soon as Lycaon had demolished the long walls, and the fortifications of the Piraeus, he constituted a council of thirty, with power, as was pretended, to make laws, but in truth to subjugate the state. These are the persons so famous in history, under the title of the thirty tyrants. They were all the creatures of Lycaon; who, as they derived their rise from conquest and the law of the sword, exercised their offices in a suitable manner; that is, with the highest testimonies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a>, insolence, and cruelty. Instead of making laws, they governed without them; appointed a senate and magistrates at their will; and, that they might do all things without danger of control, they sent for a garrison from Lacedemon; which was accordingly granted them, under the command of Callidius, upon their promise to pay the soldiers regularly. One of the first steps they took was to punish all informers; which, though severe, was popular; but when, through flattery and bribes, they had wholly drawn over Callidius to their party, they suffered bad men to live in quiet, and turned their rage against the good.\n\nCritias and Theramenes were at the head of the thirty, men of the greatest power and abilities in Athens. The former was ambitious and cruel without measure; the latter was somewhat more merciful: the former pushed on all the bloody schemes framed by his confederates, and carried into execution many of his own; the latter always opposed them, at first with moderation, at last with vehemence. He said, that power was given them to rule, and not to spoil, the commonwealth; that it became them to act like shepherds, not like wolves; and that they ought to beware of rendering themselves at once odious and ridiculous, by attempting to domineer over all, being such a handful of men as they were. The rest, disliking much the former part of his discourse, caught hold of the latter, and immediately chose out 3000, whom they made the representatives of the people, and to whom they granted this notable privilege, that none of them should be put to death but by judgment of the senate, thereby openly assuming a power of putting any other of the Athenian citizens to death by their own authority. A glorious use they made of this new assumed privilege; for as many as they conjectured to be no friends to the government in general, or to any of themselves in particular, they put to death, without cause, and without mercy. Theramenes openly opposing this, and absolutely refusing to concur in such measures, Critias accused him to the senate as a man of unfeated principles, sometimes for the people, sometimes against them, always for new things and state-revolutions. Theramenes owned, that he had sometimes changed his measures, but alleged that he had always done it to serve the people. He said that it was folly with this view he made the peace with Sparta, and accepted the office of one of the thirty: that he had never opposed their measures while they cut off the wicked; but when they began to destroy men of fortune and family, then he owned he had differed with them, which he conceived to be no crime against the state.\n\nWhile Theramenes was speaking, Critias withdrew, Theramenes perceiving that the senate were thoroughly convinced of the truth of what Theramenes had said; but he quickly returned with a guard, crying out, that he had struck Theramenes's name out of the list of the 3000; that the senate had, therefore, no longer cognizance of the cause, when the thirty had already judged and condemned him to death. Theramenes perceiving that they intended to seize him, fled to the altar, which was in the midst of the senate-house, and laying his hands thereon, said, \"I do not seek refuge here because I expect to escape death, or desire it; but that, tearing me from the altar, the impious authors of my murder may interest the gods in bringing them to speedy judgment, and thereby restore freedom to my country.\" The guards then dragged him from the altar, and carried him to the place of execution, where he drank the potion with undaunted courage, putting the people in mind with his last breath, that as they had struck his name out of the 3000, they might also strike out any of theirs. His death was followed by a train of murders, so that, in a short time, 60 of the worthiest and most eminent citizens of Athens fell by the cruelty of the thirty. Among these, the most pitied was Niceratus the son of Nicias; a man universally beloved for his goodness, and universally admired for his virtues. As for the Spartans, they, losing their former generosity, were extremely pleased with these things, and, by a public decree, commanded that such as fled from the thirty tyrants should be carried back bound to Athens: which extraordinary proceeding frightened all Greece; but the Argives and Thebans only had courage.\ncourage to oppose it: the former received the Athenian exiles with humanity and kindness; the latter punished with a mulct such of their citizens as did not rise and rescue the Athenian prisoners, who in pursuance of the Lacedemonian decree were carried bound through their territories.\n\nThrafybulus, and such as with him had taken shelter in the Theban territory, resolved to hazard everything, rather than remain perpetual exiles from their country; and though he had but 30 men on whom he could depend, yet considering the victories he had heretofore obtained in the cause of his country, he made an irruption into Attica, where he seized Phyla, a castle at a very small distance from Athens, where in a very short space his forces were augmented to 700 men; and though the tyrants made use of the Spartan garrison in their endeavours to reduce him and his party, yet Thrafybulus prevailed in various skirmishes, and at last obliged them to break up the blockade of Phyla, which they had formed. The thirty and their party conceiving it very advantageous for them to have the possession of Eleufina, marched thither, and having persuaded the people to go unarmed out of their city, that they might number them, took this opportunity most humanly to murder them. The forces of Thrafybulus increasing daily, he at length possessed himself of the Piraeus, which he fortified in the best manner he could; but the tyrants being determined to drive him from thence, came down against him with the utmost force they could raise. Thrafybulus defended himself with great obstinacy; and in the end they were forced to retreat, having lost before the place not only a great number of their men, but Critias the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> of the thirty, another of the same body, and one who had been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a> of the Piraeus.\n\nWhen they came to demand the dead from Thrafybulus, in order for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERMENT\">interment</a>, he caused a crier he had with him to make a short speech in a very loud voice to the people, entreating them to consider, that as they were citizens of Athens without, so those against whom they fought, and those who fought to preserve themselves within the fort, were Athenian citizens also; wherefore, instead of thinking how to ruin and destroy their brethren, they ought rather to consult how all differences might be composed, and especially ought to rid themselves of those bloody tyrants, who, in the short time they had had the administration in their hands, had destroyed more than had fallen in the Peloponnesian war. The people, though moved by these discourses, differed among themselves; the consequence of which was, that they expelled the thirty, and chose ten men out of each tribe to govern in their stead, whereupon the tyrants retired to Eleufina. The citizens, however, though they changed the government, made no agreement with those in the Piraeus; but sent away deputies to Sparta, as did also the tyrants from Eleufina, complaining, that the Athenians had revolted, and desiring their assistance to reduce them. The Spartans sent thereupon a large sum of money to encourage their confederates, and appointed Lyfander commander in chief, and his brother to be admiral; resolving to send sea and land forces to reduce Athens a second time; intending, as most of the Greek states suspected, to add it now to their own dominions. It is very probable that this design of theirs would have taken effect, if Paulianas king of Sparta, envying Lyfander, had not refused to obstruct it. With this view, he procured another army to be raised against the Athenians, of which himself had the command, and with which he marched immediately to besiege the Piraeus. While he lay before the place, and pretended to attack it, he entered into a private correspondence with Thrafybulus, informing him what propositions he should make in order to force the Lacedemonians, who were suspected by their allies, to grant them peace.\n\nThe intrigues of Paulianas had all the success he hoped with. The Ephori who were with him in the camp concurred in his measures, so that in a short space a treaty was concluded on the following terms: That all the citizens of Athens should be restored to their houses and privileges, excepting the thirty, the ten which had succeeded them and who had acted no less tyrannically than they, and the eleven who during the time of the oligarchy had been constituted governors or keepers of the Piraeus; that all should remain quiet for the future in the city; and that if any were afraid to trust to this agreement, they should have free leave to retire to Eleufina. Paulianas then marched away with the Spartan army, and Thrafybulus at the head of his forces marched into Athens, where having laid down their arms, they sacrificed with the rest of the citizens in the temple of Minerva, after which the popular government was restored. Yet quiet was not thoroughly established. The exiles at Eleufina having endeavoured by the help of money to raise an army of foreigners, by whose aid they might recover the authority they had lost; but first depending on their friends in the city, they sent some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> persons amongst them as deputies, to treat with the citizens; but strictly instructed them to sow jealousies and excite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCORD\">discord</a> among them. This the latter quickly perceiving, put these persons to death; and then remonstrating to those at Eleufina, that these contentions would undoubtedly end either in their own or the destruction of their country, they offered immediately to pass an act of oblivion, which they would confirm with an oath.\n\nThis being accepted, those who had withdrawn returned to the city, where all differences were adjusted, and both parties most religiously observed the agreement they had made, and thereby thoroughly reestablished the state. In this whole transaction, the virtue of Thrafybulus deserves chiefly to be admired. When he first Thrafybulsed the castle of Phyla, the tyrants privately offered bulus, to receive him into their number instead of Theramenes, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> at his request any 12 persons he should name: but he generously answered, That his exile was far more honourable than any authority could be purchased on such terms; and by perfuming in his design, accomplished, as we have seen, the deliverance of his country. A glorious deliverance it was; since, as Hippocrates informs us, they had put 1400 citizens to death contrary to and without any form of law, and driven 5000 more into banishment; procuring also the death of Alcibiades, as many think, though at a great distance from them.\n\nFrom this time to the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> of Macedon, the Athenians continued in a pretty prosperous situation, though they never performed any such great exploits.\nAttica.\n\nAs formerly. By that monarch and his son Alexander all Greece was in effect subdued, and the history of all the Grecian states from that time becomes much less interesting. Of the history of Athens from that time to the present, the following elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol2.html#article-ABRIDGMENT\">abridgment</a> is given by Dr. Chandler*. \"On the death of Alexander, the Athenians revolted, but were defeated by Antipater, who garrisoned Munychia. They rebelled again, but the garrison and oligarchy were reinstalled. Demetrius the Phaleran, who was made governor, beautified the city, and they erected to him 360 statues; which on his expulsion they demolished, except one in the Acropolis. Demetrius Poliorcetes withdrew the garrison, and restored the democracy; when they deposed him, and lodged him in the Ophitthodamos or the back part of the Parthenon, as a guest to be entertained by their goddess Minerva. Afterwards they decreed, that the Piraeus, with Munychia, should be at his disposal; and he took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a>. They expelled his garrison, and he was persuaded, by Craterus a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> to leave them free. Antigonus Gonatas, the next king, maintained a garrison in Athens; but on the death of his son Demetrius, the people, with the affluence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARATUS\">Aratus</a>, regained their liberty; and the Piraeus, Munychia, Salamis, and Sunium, on paying a sum of money.\n\nPhilip, son of Demetrius, encamping near the city, destroying and burning the sepulchres and temples in the villages, and laying their territory waste, the Athenians were reduced to solicit protection from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, and to receive a garrison, which remained until the war with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MITHRIDATES\">Mithridates</a> king of Pontus, when the tyrant Ariion made them revolt.\n\nArchelaus the Athenian general, unable to withstand the Roman fury, relinquished the long walls, and retreated into the Piraeus and Munychia. Sylla laid siege to the Piraeus and to the city, in which Ariion commanded. He was informed that some persons had been overheard taking in the Ceramicus, and blaming Ariion for his neglect of the avenues about the Hephaestalos, where the wall was accessible. Sylla resolved to storm there, and about midnight entered the town at the gate called Dypylon or the Piraeus; having levelled all obstructions in the way between it and the gate of the Piraeus. Ariion fled to the Acropolis, but was compelled to surrender by the want of water; when he was dragged from the temple of Minerva, and put to death. Sylla burned the Piraeus and Munychia, and defaced the city and suburbs, not sparing even the sepulchres.\n\nThe civil war between Caesar and Pompey soon followed, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> love of liberty made them side with Pompey. Here again they were unfortunate, for Caesar conquered. But Caesar did not treat them like Sylla. With that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLEMENCY\">clemency</a> which made so amiable part of his character, he dismissed them by a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLUSION\">allusion</a> to their illustrious ancestors, saying, that he spared the living for the sake of the dead.\n\nAnother storm followed soon after this; the wars of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRUTUS\">Brutus</a> and Cassius with Augustus and Antony. Their partiality for liberty did not here forsake them: they took part in the contest with the two patriot Romans, and erected their statues near their own ancient deliverers Harmodius and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOGITON\">Aristogiton</a>, who had slain Hipparchus. But they were still unhappy, for their enemies triumphed.\n\nThey next joined Antony, who gave them \u00c6gina and Cea, with other islands. Augustus was unkind to them; and they revolted four years before he died. Under Tiberius the city was declining, but free, and regarded as an ally of the Romans. The high privilege of having a lictor to precede the magistrates was conferred on it by Germanicus; but he was censured as treating with too much condescension a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of nations, instead of genuine Athenians, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> was then considered as extinct.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Vespasian reduced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACHAIA\">Achaia</a> to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> paying tribute and governed by a proconsul. Nerva was more propitious to the Athenians; and Pliny, under Trajan his successor, exhorts Maximus to be mindful whither he was sent, to rule genuine Greece, a state composed of free cities. \"You will rever the gods and heroes their founders. You will respect their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> glory, and even their age. You will honour them for the famous deeds, which are truly, nay for those which are fabulously, recorded of them. Remember, it is Athens you approach.\" This city was now entirely dependent on Rome, and was reduced to sell Delos and the islands in its possession.\n\nHadrian, who was at once emperor and an archon of Athens, gave the city laws, compiled from Draco, Solon, and the codes of other legislators; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> his affection for it by unbounded liberality. Athens flourished, and its beauty was renewed. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTONINUS_PIUS\">Antoninus Pius</a> who succeeded, and Antoninus the philosopher, were both benefactors.\n\nThe barbarians of the north, in the reign of Valerian, besieging Thebailouca, all Greece was terrified, and the Athenians restored their city-wall, which had been dismantled by Sylla, and afterwards neglected.\n\nUnder the next emperor, who was the archon Gallienus, Athens was besieged, the archontic office ceased; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STRATEGUS\">strategus</a> or general, who had before acted as overseer of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol2.html#article-AGORA\">agora</a> or market, then became the supreme magistrate. Under Claudius his successor, the city was taken, but soon recovered.\n\nIt is related, that Constantine, when emperor, gloried in the title of general of Athens; and rejoiced exceedingly on obtaining from the people the honour of a statue with an inscription, which he acknowledged by a yearly gratuity of many bushels of grain. He conferred on the governor of Attica and Athens the title of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a>, \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2. That office was at first annual, but afterwards hereditary. His son Constans bestowed several islands on the city, to supply it with corn.\n\nIn the time of Theodore I., 380 years after Christ, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHS\">Goths</a> laid waste Thessaly and Epirus; but Theodore, general of the Achaeans, by his prudent conduct preserved the cities of Greece from pillage, and the inhabitants from being led into captivity. A statue of marble was erected to him at Athens by order of the city; and afterwards one of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, by command of the emperor, as appears from an inscription in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> dedicated to a saint of the same name, not far from the French convent. It is on a round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEDESTAL\">pedestal</a>, which supports a flat stone serving for the holy table. Eudocia the wife of Theodore II., was an Athenian.\n\nThe fatal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> now approached, and Athens by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALARIC\">Alaric</a> was about to experience a conqueror more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> than\nthan Sylla. This was Alaric king of the Goths; who, under the emperors Arcadius and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HONORIUS\">Honorius</a>, overran Greece and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, lacking, pillaging, and destroying. Then the Peloponnesian towns were overturned, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCADIA\">Arcadia</a> and Lacedemon were laid waste, the two seas by the isthmus were burnt with the flames of Corinth, and the Athenian matrons were dragged in chains by barbarians. The invaluable treasures of antiquity, it is related, were removed; the stately and magnificent structures converted into piles of ruin; and Athens was stripped of every thing splendid or remarkable. Synesius, a writer of that age, compares the city to a victim, of which the body had been consumed, and the hide only remained.\n\n\"After this event, Athens became an unimportant place, and as obscure as it once had been famous. We read that the cities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HELLAS\">Hellas</a> were put into a state of defence by Justinian, who repaired the walls, which at Corinth had been subverted by an earthquake, and at Athens and in Boeotia were impaired by age; and here we take a long farewell of this city. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of near 700 years ensues in its history, except that, about the year 1130, it furnished Roger the first king of Sicily with a number of artificers, whom he settled at Palermo, where they introduced the culture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, which then passed into Italy. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a> had been brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> to Constantinople in the reign of Justinian.\n\n\"Athens, as it were, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-emerges from oblivion in the 13th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, under Baldwin, but besieged by a general of Theodorus Lascaris, the Greek emperor. It was taken in 1427 by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SULTAN\">Sultan</a> Morat. Boniface, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARQUIS\">marquis</a> of Montferrat, possessed it with a garrison; after whom it was governed by Delves, of the house of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARAGON\">Aragon</a>. On his death it was seized, with Macedonia, Thrace, Boeotia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHOCIS\">Phocis</a>, and the Peloponnesus, by Bajazet; and then, with the island <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZANTE\">Zante</a>, by the Spaniards of Catalonia in the reign of the Greek emperor Andronicus Paleologus the elder. These were dispossessed by Reinerius Acciaioli, a Florentine; who, leaving no legitimate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> issue, bequeathed it to the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>. His natural son, Antony, to whom he had given Thebes with Boeotia, expelled the Venetians. He was succeeded in the dukedom by his kinsman Nerius, who was displaced by his own brother named Antony, but recovered the government when he died. Nerius, leaving only an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a> son, was succeeded by his wife. She was ejected by Mahomet on a complaint from Francis son of the second Antony, who confined her at Megara, and made way with her; but her son accusing him to Mahomet the Second, the Turkish army under Omar advanced, and he surrendered the citadel in 1455; the Latins refusing to succour him unless the Athenians would embrace their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> tenets. Mahomet, it is related, when he had finished the war with the depot of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOREA\">Morea</a>, four years after, surveyed the city and Acropolis with admiration. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JANIZARIES\">janizaries</a> informed him of a conspiracy; and Francis Acciaioli, who remained lord of Boeotia, was put to death. In 1464 the Venetians landed at Piraeus, surprised the city, and carried off their plunder and captives to Euboea.\n\n\"It is remarkable, that after these events Athens was again in a manner forgotten. So lately as about the middle of the 16th century, the city was commonly believed to have been utterly destroyed, and not to exist, except a few huts of poor fishermen. Crufius, a learned and inquisitive German, procured more authentic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> from his Greek correspondents residing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a>, which he published in 1584, to awaken curiosity and to promote farther discoveries. One of these letters is from a native of Nauplia, a town near Argos in the Morea. This writer says that he had been often at Athens, and that it still contained many things worthy to be seen, some of which he enumerates, and then subjoins; \"But why do I dwell on this place? It is as the skin of an animal which has been long dead.\"\n\nIt now remains to give some idea of the character, government, and religion of this once so famous people.\n\nThe Athenians, says Plutarch, are very subject to character violent anger; but they are soon pacified. They are of the alike easily impressed with humanity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPASSION\">compassion</a>. That this was their temper, is proved by many historical examples. We shall produce a few. The sentence of death pronounced against the inhabitants of Mitylene, and revoked the next day: The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDEMNATION\">condemnation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a>, and that of the ten chiefs, each followed by quick repentance and most pungent grief.\n\nThe minds of the same people, adds Plutarch, are not formed for laborious researches. They seize a subject, as it were, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTUITION\">intuition</a>; they have not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> and phlegm enough to examine it gradually and minutely. This part of their character may seem surprising and incredible. Artisans, and other people of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, are in general slow of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a>. But the Athenians of every degree were endowed with an inconceivable vivacity, penetration, and delicacy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. Even the Athenian soldiers could repeat the fine sayings of the tragedies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EURIPIDES\">Euripides</a>. Those artisans and those soldiers assisted at public debates, were bred to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> affairs, and were equally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> in apprehension and in judgment. We may infer the understanding of the hearers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMOSTHENES\">Demosthenes</a> from the genius of his orations, which were laconic and poignant.\n\nAs their inclination, continues Plutarch, leads them to assist and support people of low condition, they like discourse seasoned with pleasantry, and productive of mirth. The Athenians patronize people of low degree; because from them their liberty is in no danger, and because such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> tends to support a democratical constitution. They love pleasantry; which turn of mind proves that they are a humane social people, who have a taste for railing and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>, and are not found with that reserve which marks the depot or the slave.\n\nThey take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> in hearing themselves praised; but they can likewise patiently bear railing and censure. We know with what art and success <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOPHANES\">Aristophanes</a> and Demosthenes applied their praise and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRONY\">irony</a> to the Athenian people. When the republic enjoyed peace, says the same Plutarch in another place, it encouraged the adulation of its orators: but when it had important affairs to discuss, when the state was in danger, it became serious; and preferred to its eloquent lycephants, the honest orators who opposed its follies and its vices; such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> and bold patriots as Pericles, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHOCION\">Phocion</a>, and a Demosthenes.\n\nThe Athenians, continues Plutarch, often make their governors tremble, and show great humanity to their\ntheir enemies. They were very attentive to the information and instruction of those citizens who were most eminent for their policy and eloquence; but they were on their guard against the superiority of their talents; they often checked their boldness, and repressed their exuberant reputation and glory. That this was their temper, we are convinced by the ostracism: which was established to restrain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a> of those who had great talents and influence, and which spared neither the greatest nor the best men. The detestation of tyranny and of tyrants, which was inherent in the Athenians, rendered them extremely jealous of their privileges, made them zealous and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> in defence of their liberty, whenever they thought it was violated by men in power.\n\nAs to their enemies, they did not treat them with rigour. They did not abuse victory by a brutal inhumanity to the vanquished. The act of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMNESTY\">amnesty</a>, which they passed after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-USURPATION\">usurpation</a> of the 30 tyrants, proves that they could easily forgive injuries. It was this mildness, this humanity of disposition, which made the Athenians so attentive to the rules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECORUM\">decorum</a>. In their war with Philip, having seized one of his couriers, they read all the letters he bore, except one from Olympias to her husband, which they sent back unopened. Such was their veneration of love and conjugal fidelity; those sacred rights, which no enmity, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSTILITY\">hostility</a>, warrants us to violate!\n\nThe views of conquest cherished by a small republic, were extensive and astonishing; but this people, so great, so ambitious in their projects, were, in other respects, of a different character. In the expenses of the table, in dress, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a>, in houses, in short, in private life, they were frugal, simple, modest, poor; but sumptuous and magnificent whenever the honour of the state was concerned. Their conquests, their victories, their riches, their connections with the inhabitants of Asia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a>, never reduced them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a>, to riot, to pomp, to profusion. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-XENOPHON\">Xenophon</a> remarks, that a citizen was not distinguished from a slave by his dress. The wealthiest citizen, the most renowned general, was not ashamed to go himself to market.\n\nThe taste of the Athenians, for all the arts and sciences, is well known. When they had delivered themselves from the tyranny of Pisistratus, and after this had defeated the vast efforts of the Persians, they may be considered as at the summit of their national glory. For more than half a century afterwards they maintained, without control, the sovereignty of Greece; and that attendant produced a security, which left their minds at ease, and gave them leisure to cultivate every thing liberal or elegant. It was then that Pericles adorned the city with temples, theatres, and other beautiful public buildings. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHIDIAS\">Phidias</a>, the great sculptor, was employed as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a>, who, when he had erected edifices, adorned them himself, and added statues and bas-reliefs, the admiration of every beholder. It was then that Polignotus and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MYRON\">Myron</a> painted; that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOPHOCLES\">Sophocles</a> and Euripides wrote; and not long after, that they saw the divine Socrates.\n\nHuman affairs are, by nature, prone to change; and states, as well as individuals, are born to decay. Jealousy and ambition insensibly fomented wars, and success in these wars, as in others, was often various. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> strength of the Athenians was first impaired by the Lacedemonians; after that it was again humiliated, under Epaminondas, by the Thebans: and last of all it was wholly crushed by the Macedonian, Philip.\n\nNor, when their political sovereignty was lost, did their love of literature and the arts link along with it. Just at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of their golden days of empire flourished Xenophon and Plato, the disciples of Socrates, and from Plato descended that race of philosophers called the Old Academy. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, who was Plato's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a>, may be said not to have invented a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, but rather to have tempered the sublime and rapturous mysteries of his master with method, order, and a stricter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>. Zeno, who was himself also educated in the principles of Platonism, only differed from Plato in the comparative estimate of things, allowing nothing to be intrinsically good but virtue, nothing intrinsically bad but vice, and considering all other things to be in themselves indifferent. He too and Aristotle accurately cultivated logic, but in different ways; for Aristotle chiefly dwelt upon the simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYLLOGISM\">syllogism</a>; Zeno upon that which is derived out of it, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> or hypothetic. Both too, as well as other philosophers, cultivated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a> along with logic; holding a knowledge in both to be requisite for those who think of addressing mankind with all the efficacy of persuasion. Zeno elegantly illustrated the force of these two powers by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SIMILE\">simile</a> taken from the hand: the close power of logic he compared to the fist, or hand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a> power of logic, to the palm, or hand open.\n\nThe new academy was founded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCESILAUS\">Arcesilaus</a>, and ably maintained by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARNEADES\">Carneades</a>. From a mistaken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the great parent of philosophy Socrates (particularly as he appears in the dialogues of Plato), because Socrates doubted some things, therefore Arcesilaus and Carneades doubted all.\u2014Epicurus drew from another source; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMOCRITUS\">Democritus</a> had taught him atoms and a void: by the fortuitous concourse of atoms he fancied he could form a world; while by a feigned veneration he complimented away his gods, and totally denied their providential care, lest the trouble of it should impair their uninterrupted state of bliss. Virtue he recommended, though not for the sake of virtue, but pleasure; pleasure, according to him, being our chief and sovereign good. See Aristotle, Epicurus, Plato, Socrates, &c.\n\nWe have already mentioned the alliance between philosophy and rhetoric. This cannot be thought wonderful, if rhetoric be the art by which men are persuaded, and if men cannot be persuaded without a knowledge of human nature: for what but philosophy can procure us this knowledge? It was for this reason the ablest Greek philosophers not only taught, but wrote also treatises upon rhetoric. They had a farther inducement, and that was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> beauty of their language as it was then spoken among the learned and polite. They would have been ashamed to have delivered philosophy, as it has been too often delivered since, in compositions as clumsy as the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DIALECT\">dialect</a> of the mere vulgar.\n\nThe same love of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a>, which made them attend to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, made them attend even to the pla-\nces where their philosophy was taught. Plato delivered his lectures in a place shaded with groves, on the banks of the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ILISSUS\">Ilissus</a>; and which, as it once belonged to a person called Academus, was called after his name, the Academy. Aristotle chose another spot of a similar character, where there were trees and shades; a spot called the Lyceum. Zeno taught in a portico or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLONNADE\">colonnade</a>, distinguished from other buildings of that sort (of which the Athenians had many) by the name of the Variegated Portico, the walls being decorated with various paintings of Polygnotus and Myro, two capital masters of that transcendent period. Epicurus addressed his hearers in those well-known gardens, called, after his own name, The gardens of Epicurus.\n\nThese places of public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> were called among the Greeks by the name of Gymnasia; in which, whatever that word might have originally meant, were taught all those exercises, and all those arts, which tended to cultivate not only the body but the mind. As man was a being consisting of both, the Greeks could not consider that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> as complete, in which both were not regarded, and both properly formed. Hence their Gymnasia, with reference to this double end, were adorned with two statues, those of Mercury and of Hercules, the corporeal accomplishments being patronized (as they supposed) by the god of strength, the mental accomplishments by the god of ingenuity.\n\nIt was for the cultivation of every liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a> that Athens was celebrated (as we have said) during many centuries, long after her political influence was lost and at an end.\n\nShe was the place of education, not only for Greeks but for Romans. It was hither that Horace was sent by his father; it was here that Cicero put his son Marcus under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRATIPPUS\">Cratippus</a>, one of the ablest philosophers then belonging to that city.\u2014The feats of philosophers which we have already described, were still existing when St Paul came thither. We cannot enough admire the superior eloquence of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol3.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a>, in his manner of addressing so intelligent an audience. We cannot enough admire the sublimity of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXORDIUM\">exordium</a>; the propriety of his mentioning an altar which he had found there; and his quotation from Aratus, one of their well-known poets. Nor was Athens only celebrated for the residence of philosophers, and the institution of youth: men of rank and fortune found pleasure in a retreat, which contributed so much to their liberal enjoyment.\n\nWe shall finish this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of the Athenians by the addition of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> more, to which every one will admit they have a right; an object which was prominent and striking, in all their actions and in all their enterprises: We mean their ardent love of liberty. This was their predominant quality; the main spring of their government. From the beginning of the Persian war, they sacrificed every thing to the liberty of Greece. They left, without hesitation, their cities, their houses, to fight at sea the common enemy, from whom they were in danger of servitude. What a glorious day was it for Athens, when all her allies, growing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> to the advantageous offers which were made to them by the king of Persia, the replied by Ariphides, to the ambassadors of that monarch,\u2014\u201cThat it was impossible for all the gold in the world to tempt the republic of Athens: to prevail with her to sell her liberty, and that of Greece.\u201d It was by these generous sentiments that the Athenians not only became the bulwark of Greece, but likewise guarded the rest of Europe from a Persian invasion.\n\nThese great qualities were blended with great failings, seemingly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with patriotism. For the Athenians, notwithstanding their tenacious jealousy of the rights of their country, were a volatile, inconstant, capricious people.\n\nThere never was a people more attentive to the worship of the gods than the Athenians. The worship of their principal deities was diffused over all Greece, and even beyond its limits.\n\nEach temple had its particular religious rites: the pomp, the ceremonies, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, and the succession of the solemn feasts were all appointed by fixed rules. The worship paid to each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>, whether public or private, was founded on traditions, or on laws constantly obeyed. The feast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACCHUS\">Bacchus</a>, the Panathenaic, the feast of the mysteries of Eleusis, were celebrated according to established rules, most of which were as ancient as the feasts themselves. The old customs, of which the priests were the guardians, were observed in the temples. It is probable that the priests were consulted on affairs in which the worship of a deity was interested, and that their answer was decisive. We are certain that the Eumolpidae had this authority. They were the interpreters of the ancient laws on which the worship of Ceres was founded, its magnificence, and its mode\u2014laws which were not written, as Lyrias informs us, but were perpetuated by a constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>. The abuses which had gradually crept into the celebration of those feasts, had given rise to several new regulations; to that of the orator Lycurgus, for example, and to the law of Solon, which enjoined the senate to repair to Eleusis on the second day of the feast: but neither these, nor the other particular regulations which we find in Samuel Petit\u2019s collection of Attic laws, could make a religious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CODE\">code</a>. There was no general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> which comprehended all the branches of their religion, which, by combining all its articles, might regulate their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> and conduct, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the judges in their decisions.\n\nCrimes against religion were only punished as they affected the state; and consequently they were tried by the magistrate. Mere railing, though somewhat rare, sometimes punished than offending the ministers of the gods. The Athenians acknowledged no other religion than the hereditary public worship; no other gods than those they had received from their ancestors; no other ceremonies than those which had been established by the laws of the state, and practised by their country from time immemorial. They were only solicitous to preserve this worship, which was closely interwoven with their government, and made a part of its policy. They were likewise attentive to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONIAL\">ceremonial</a> pomp; because order, the regular vigour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a>, depends greatly on the awe impressed by externals. But as to the inconstant and monstrous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANCE\">romance</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a>, foreign opinions, popular traditions, and poetical fictions, which formed a religion quite different from that of the state\u2014in it they were very little interested, and allowed every one to think of it as he pleased.\n\nThis explanation will reconcile a seeming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>.\nAttica.\n\nThe priests were not confined to the care of the altars; they who were veiled with the facerdotal dignity, which was only incompatible with professions merely useful and lucrative, might likewise hold the most important offices of the commonwealth. This we could prove by a great number of examples; we shall cite that of Xenophon the illustrious historian and philosopher: he was likewise a famous general, and he was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>. He was performing the facerdotal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> when he received the news of his son's death, who was killed at the battle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANTINEA\">Mantinea</a>.\n\nThe sacred ministry was not only compatible with civil offices, but likewise with the profession of arms. The priest and the soldier were often blended. Calias, the priest of Ceres, fought at Platea. This custom was not peculiar to the Athenians. The Lacedemonians, after the battle which we have just mentioned, made three graves for their slain; one for the priests, one for the other Spartans, and one for the Hclota.\n\nAs the ordinary business of life was incompatible with the facerdotal dignity, the priests had a revenue fixed to their office. We know that a part of the victims was their right, and that apartments were assigned them near the temples. But, beside these advantages, they had a salary proportioned to the dignity of their functions and to the rank of the deities whom they served. Their salary was probably paid from the revenue of the temples. Those revenues, which kept the temples in repair, and defrayed the sacrificial expenses, were very considerable. They were of many different kinds.\n\nA great part of the sacred revenues arose from fines, which individuals were condemned to pay for various offences; fines, of which the tenth part was appropriated to Minerva Polias, and the fifth to the other gods, and to the heroes whose names their tribes bore. Besides, if the Prytanes did not hold the assemblies conformably with the laws, they were obliged to pay a fine of 1000 drachmas to the goddess. If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROEDRI\">Proedri</a>, i.e., the senators whose office it was to lay before the assembly the matters on which they were to deliberate, did not discharge that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> according to the rules prescribed to them, they were likewise condemned to pay a fine, which, as the former, was applied to the use of Minerva. By these fines her temple must have been greatly enriched.\n\nBesides this revenue, which was the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the gods, and which varied according to the number and degrees of the misdemeanor, the temples had their permanent revenues: We mean the produce of the lands which were consecrated to the deities. We do not here allude to the lands consecrated to the gods, which were never to be cultivated; such as the territory of Cirrha, proscribed by a solemn decree of the Amphictyons; the land betwixt Megara and Attica, which was consecrated to the godesses of Eleusis, and many others. We would speak only of those which were cultivated, the fruits of which enriched the temples.\n\nThere were likewise lands belonging to the state, the produce of which was destined to defray the expense of the sacrifices which were offered in the name of the republic. There were likewise first-fruits which the public officers levied on all lands, for the use of the gods. All these emoluments made a part of the revenue of the temples.\n\nThe gods, besides the revenues immediately appertaining to their temples, had certain rights which were granted them by particular compact. The Lepreatae, for instance, were obliged to pay every year a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> to Olympian Jupiter, on account of a treaty of alliance which they made with the Eleans in one of their wars. The inhabitants of Epidaurus, to obtain leave from the Athenians to cut down olive-trees for statues, which the Pythian priests had commanded them to make, engaged to send deputies every year to Athens, to offer sacrifices in their name to Minerva and to Neptune. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a> was rather honorary than lucrative.\n\nThe tenth part of the spoils taken in war was likewise the property of Minerva. Sacred vessels were bought with the effects of the 30 tyrants. In short, the gods were profited by almost every public accident. But what contributed most to enrich the famous temples of Greece, was the money which was constantly brought to them by individuals, in consequence of vows they had made, or to pay for sacrifices which were offered in their names. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDULITY\">credulity</a> of the people was an inexhaustible fund. That credulity enriched the temples of Delos and Eleusis, and supported the magnificence of Delphi. And those immense treasures which were the fruit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, were often a prey to avarice.\n\nThese revenues were not deposited with the priests; nor did they expend them. A moderate salary was all their gain; and to offer sacrifices to the deities whose ministers they were, was all their employment.\n\nIt is very probable that all the sacred revenues were paid into the hands of officers who were appointed to receive them, and who were to give an account of the discharge of their trust. Nay, we cannot doubt of this, after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> a passage in Aristotle, who, speaking of the officers of the temples, expressly mentions those who are intrusted with the money appertaining to the gods. Citizens, without doubt, of approved integrity, were chosen to this office; and their duty must have been, to keep the temples in repair and order, and to disburse and keep an account of the ordinary sacred expenses.\n\nAs to the solemn feasts, which were incredibly magnificent, such as the feast of Bacchus, and the Panathenaea, they were celebrated at the expense of the choregus; i.e., of the chief of the choir of each tribe; for each tribe had its poet and its musicians, who sung, emulating each other, hymns in honour of the deity. The richest citizens were appointed chiefs of the different choirs; and as their office was very expensive, to indemnify them in some degree, the choregus of\nAttica, the victorious tribe had the privilege of engraving his name on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIPOD\">tripod</a> which that tribe suspended to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> of the temple. This office, though ruinous, was eagerly solicited; and naturally, in a republican state. It led to honours, like the curule dignity at Rome; and it greatly tended to ingratiate its possessor with a people who were more affected with pleasures than with essential services, and who, consequently, would more highly esteem a profuse choregus than a victorious general.\n\nWith regard to the fines, which were in the whole, or in part, the property of Minerva and of the other deities, there were at Athens public treasurers appointed to receive them. They were ten in number, and they were nominated by lot. They were called Treasurers of the goddes, or Receivers of the sacred money. That money they received in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of the senate; and they were empowered to diminish or to annihilate the fine, if they thought it unjust. The statue of Minerva, that of the Victories, and the other invaluable pledges of the duration of the state, were deposited with them.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a> in which the money consecrated to the gods was kept, was in the citadel, behind the temple of Minerva Polias; and from its situation it was termed Opisthodomus. It was surrounded with a double wall. It had but one door, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KEY\">key</a> of which was kept by the Epitastes, or chief of the Prytanes; his dignity was very considerable; but it lasted only one day. In this treasury a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> was kept, in which were written the names of all those who were indebted to the state; he who owed the smallest fine was not omitted. If the debtors proved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSOLVENT\">insolvent</a>, they were prosecuted with extreme rigour, and often punished with a cruelty which religion could not excuse; though the interest of the gods was the motive, or rather the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a>. The sacred treasurers held a considerable rank among the magistrates who received the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINANCES\">finances</a>. Of these magistrates there were many kinds, as there were many sorts of revenues.\n\nThe Athenian priests did not compose an order distinct and separate from the other orders of the state. They did not form a body united by particular laws, under a chief whose authority extended to all his inferiors. The dignity of sovereign pontiff was unknown at Athens; and each of the priests served his particular temple, unconnected with his brethren. The temples, indeed, of the principal deities; those of Minerva, for instance, of Neptune, of Ceres, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROSERPINE\">Proserpine</a>, had many ministers; and in each of them a chief presided, who had the title of High Priest. The number of subaltern ministers was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the rank of the deity; but the priests of one temple were altogether a separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> from those of another. Thus at Athens there was a great number of high-priests, because many deities were worshipped there, whose service required many ministers. The power of each priest was confined to his temple; and there was no sovereign pontiff, the minister general of the gods, and the president at all the feasts.\n\nIt naturally follows from this account, that the ministers of the gods at Athens were not judges in matters of religion. They were neither authorized to take cognizance of crimes committed against the deity, nor to punish them. Their function was to offer sacrifices to the gods, and to entreat their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCEPTANCE\">acceptance</a> of the adorations of the people. But the punishment of Attica's impiety, of sacrilege, of the profanation of mysteries, and of other irreligious crimes, was not entrusted to their zeal.\n\nThe priests were not only incapable of avenging crimes against religion by a temporal process; they even could not, without an express order either from the senate or the people, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> their right of devoting criminals to the infernal gods. It was in consequence of a civil sentence pronounced against Alcibiades, that the Eumolpide launched their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANATHEMA\">anathema</a> against him. It was in virtue of another decree that they revoked their imprecations, when his countrymen wanted his service, and therefore restored him to their favour.\n\nReligious causes, according to M. de Bougainville, fell under the jurisdiction of the Heliastae.\n\nThe government, though often altered, continued pretty much on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> established by Solon.\n\nThe people of Athens were freemen, sojourners, or slaves. The citizens, called in Greek Politeiai, were very numerous; but what may seem strange, were as many in the time of Cecrops as in the most flourishing state of the commonwealth, hardly ever exceeding 20,000. It was Solon who decreed that none should be accounted free but such as were Athenians both by father and mother. After his time it fell into defection, till revived by Pericles; and was again at his influence repealed. After the expulsion of the 30 tyrants, Solon's law was restored. A person born of a stranger was styled Nothos, a bastard; whereas the son of a free woman was called Cnephos, i.e. legitimate. There was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CYNOSARGES\">Cynosarges</a> a court of judicature, to which causes of illegitimacy properly belonged; and the utmost care was taken to prevent any from being enrolled Athenian citizens, who had not a clear title thereto. The citizens were divided by Cecrops into four tribes: the first called Cecropes, from Cecrops; the second, Anoichthon, from a king of that name; the third, Actai, from Acteus, another king of Athens, or rather from Acte, which signifies a shore; the fourth, Puralia: these names were altered by Cranans, and again by Erichthonius. In the reign of Erichtheus, they were again changed; the soldiers were called Oulai; the craftsmen Ergatai; the farmers Georgoi, the graziers and shepherds Agiorai: in this state they were when Solon settled the commonwealth, and appointed the senate to be composed of 400, 100 out of each tribe. Clytithenes increased the number of the tribes to ten; and made the senate consist of 500, taking 50 out of each tribe. In succeeding times, two other tribes were added. Each tribe was subdivided into its Demoi or wards; and with respect to these it was that Solon instituted the public feasts before-mentioned, at which sometimes the whole tribe assembled, sometimes several wards, and sometimes only the inhabitants of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARD\">ward</a>.\n\nThe second sort of inhabitants we mentioned were called Metoicoi, i.e. sojourners; these were persons who lived always at Athens, yet were not admitted free denizens: as for such as did not constantly reside in Athens, they were styled Xenoi; i.e. strangers. The sojourners were obliged to choose out of the citizens protectors, who were styled Patrons; they paid services to the state, and besides these an annual tribute of 12 drachmas for every man, and six for every woman; but such as had sons, and paid for them, were exempted.\nAttica. exempted. If people fell to poverty, and were not able to pay the tribute, they were feized by the tax-masters, and actually sold for slaves; which, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol8.html#article-DIOGENES\">Diogenes</a> Laertius tells us, was the fate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-XENOCRATES\">Xenocrates</a> the philosopher. The fojourners in Attica were under the same law as those in Athens. As to servants, they were freemen, who through indigency were driven to receive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a>, and while they were in this state had no vote in the assembly. As to slaves, they were absolutely the property of their masters, and as such were used as they thought fit: They were forbidden to wear clothes, or to cut their hair like their masters; and, which is indeed amazing, Solon prohibited them to love boys, as if that had been honourable: They were likewise debarred from anointing or perfuming themselves, and from worshipping certain deities: They were not allowed to be called by honourable names; and in most other respects were used like dogs. They fligmatized them at their pleasure, that is, branded them with letters in the forehead and elsewhere. However, Theseus's temple was allowed them as a sanctuary, whither, if they were exceedingly ill used, they might fly, and thereby oblige their owners to let them be transferred to another master. In this and many other respects the Athenian slaves were in a much better condition than those throughout the rest of Greece: they were permitted to get estates for themselves, giving a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREMIUM\">premium</a> to their masters, who were obliged to make them free if they could pay their ransom; they likewise obtained the same favour from the kindness of their masters, or for having rendered military services to the states. When they were made free, they were obliged to choose patrons; and had likewise the privilege of choosing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CURATOR\">curator</a>, who, in case their patrons injured them, was bound to defend them.\n\nThe general assembly of the people, which Solon made the dernier refort, was called the Ecclesia; and consisted of all the freemen of Athens, excepting such as were atimoi or infamous. The meetings of these assemblies were either ordinary or extraordinary. The ordinary were such as were appointed by law, the extraordinary such as necessity required. Of the first there were four in 35 days. In the first assembly they approved or rejected magistrates, heard proposals for the public good, and certain causes. In the second they received petitions, and heard every man's judgment on the matters that were before them. In the third they gave audience to foreign ambassadors. The fourth was employed altogether in affairs relating to the gods and their worship. The extraordinary meetings were appointed by the magistrates when occasion required, whereas to the ordinary assemblies the people came of their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a>. The first were held either in the market-place, in the Pryx a place near the citadel, or in the theatre of Bacchus: as to the latter, the magistrates who appointed the extraordinary meeting appointed also the place where it should be held. If any sudden tempest rose, or any earthquake happened, or any sign notoriously inauspicious appeared, the assembly was immediately adjourned, to prevent the people from apprehending unhappy consequences from their deliberations. But if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> was fair and serene, and nothing happened out of the ordinary course of things, they proceeded to purify the place where the assembly was held, which was done by sprinkling it round with the blood of young pigs; then the crier made a solemn prayer for the prosperity of the republic, and that heaven would bestow a happy issue on their counsels and undertakings: he then pronounced a bitter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXECRATION\">execration</a> against any who should in that assembly propose what might be disadvantageous to the state. These ceremonies being over, they proceeded to business.\n\nThere were several magistrates who had the oversee of Method of and regulating these assemblies. These were first, giving their opinions, the Epistle, or president of the assembly, who was chosen by lot out of the Proedri: his office was to give the signal for the people's voting. Next to him were the Prytanes, i.e., a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> of the senate, who of course were present on this occasion: by their order a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROGRAMMA\">programma</a>, or scheme of the business to be proposed at the assembly, was previously set up in some public place, that every man might know what business to apply his thoughts to. The Proedri were nine in number, appointed by lots out of all the tribes to which the Prytanes did not belong: they had the right of proposing to the people what they were to deliberate upon, and their office ended with the assembly; there sat with them assessors, who were to take care that nothing they proposed was detrimental to the commonwealth. The first step to business was the crier's reading the decree of the senate wherein the assembly was to deliberate; when he had finished this, he made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a> in these words: Who of the men above 30 will make an oration? When the old men had done speaking, the crier made proclamation again that any Athenian might then offer his sentiments, whom the law allowed to do; that is, all such as were above 30 years old, and were not infamous. If such a one rose up to speak, the Prytanes interposed, and bid him be silent; and if he did not obey them, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LICTORS\">lictors</a> pulled him down by force. When the debates were over, the president permitted the people to vote; which they did by casting first beans, but in after times <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEBBLES\">pebbles</a>, into certain vessels: these were counted, and then it was declared that the decree of the senate was either rejected or approved: after which, the Prytanes dismissed the assembly.\n\nThe senate was instituted by Solon to prevent the dangerous consequences of leaving the supreme power in the people. At the time of its institution, it was to consist of 400, 100 out of each tribe; it was increased to 500, when the tribes were augmented to 10; and when they came to 12, it was also swelled to 600. They were elected by lots after this manner: At a day appointed, towards the close of the year, the president of each tribe gave in a list of such persons belonging thereto, as were fit for and desired to appear for this dignity: these names were engraved on tables of brass, and a number of beans equal to the number of the amount of them, among which were 100 white ones, put into a vessel; and then the names of the candidates and the beans were drawn one by one, and such as were drawn by the white beans were received into the senate. After the senate was elected, they proceeded to appoint the officers who were to preside in the senate: these were the Prytanes before-mentioned; and they were elected thus: The names of the ten tribes were thrown into one vessel, and nine black beans and a white one into another vessel. Then the names of the tribes...\ntribes were drawn with the beans. The tribe to which\nthe white bean answered, presided first; and the rest\naccording to the order in which they were drawn.\n\nThe Prytanes, while the senate consisted of 500,\nwere 50 in number. For the farther avoiding of con-\nfusion, therefore, 10 of these presided a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, during\nwhich space they were called Proedri; and out of these\nan Epituate or president was chosen, whose office lasted\nbut one day, and by law no man could hold it more\nthan once: the reason of this was, that he had in his\ncustody the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>, the keys of the citadel, and\nthe charge of the exchequer. The reader must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DIS\">dis</a>-\ntinguish between the Epitutes and Proedri last men-\ntioned, and those spoken of in the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PARAGRAPH\">paragraph</a>,\nbecause, though their titles were the same, their offices\nwere perfectly distinct. The senate assembled by di-\nrection of the Prytanes once every day, excepting fe-\nstivals, and sometimes oftener in the senate-house, which\nwas thence called Prytaneeum.\n\nWhen a member of the senate made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> for a\nnew law, it was immediately engraven on tablets, that\nthe members when they came next might be prepared\nto speak to it. At the subsequent assembly the Epi-\ntutes opened the matter; after which every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATOR\">senator</a>\nthat pleased delivered his sentiments; then any of the\nPrytanes drew up the decree, and repeated it aloud:\nafter which they proceeded to vote; and if there was\na majority of white beans, then it became psephisma,\nand was afterwards propounded to the people: if they\napproved it, it became a law; otherwise it was of no\nforce longer than the senate who decreed it subsisted.\n\nThe power of the senate was very great; for they took\nthe account of magistrates at the expiration of their of-\nfices; they directed the provisions made for poor citi-\nzens out of the public treasure; they had the superin-\ntendency of public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRISONS\">prisons</a>, and a power of punishing\nsuch as committed acts morally evil, though not prohi-\nbited by any law; they had the care likewise of the\nfleet; and besides all these they had many other branch-\nes of authority, which it is not necessary for us to men-\ntion. Before they took their seats, they were con-\nstrained to undergo a very strict <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, wherein\nthe whole course of their lives was inquired into; and\nif the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLUR\">slur</a> on their reputation appeared, they were\nset aside. When this examination was over, they took\nan oath, whereby they bound themselves to promote in\nall their counsels the public good, to advise nothing\ncontrary to the laws, and to execute their functions ex-\nactly. The highest fine the senate could impose was\n500 drachms: if they thought the offender deserved\na heavier mulct, they then transmitted the cause to the\nThemistothetae, who punished them as they thought fit.\n\nThe senators, when their year was out, gave an ac-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> of their management to the people: but that\nthey might have the less to do, they always punished\nsuch of their number as they found had offended by\nexpulsion; and in this they were mighty exact. Yet\nan expelled senator was notwithstanding eligible to any\nother office, the most trivial omission being sufficient\nto occasion a dismission from the senatorial dignity;\nand therefore, when the tribes chose their senators,\nthey also chose a certain number of substitutes, out of\nwhich, when a senator was expelled, another was sub-\nstituted in his place. Each senator was allowed a\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRACHM\">drachm</a> every day: for it was a constant rule with the\nAthenians, that the public ought to pay for every man's\ntime; and therefore such of the poor Athenians as\nthought fit to demand it, had three oboli for going to\nthe assembly. If during their administration any ships\nof war were built, the senators had crowns decreed\nthem; but if not, they were forbid to sue for them.\n\nNext to the senate was the court of Areopagus;\nfor a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of which see that article.\n\nThe chief magistrates of Athens were Archons, and Archons,\ninferior to them there were many others; of whom it\nwill be necessary to mention some. In the first place\nthey had Nomophylaces, who were also styled the elec-\ntive, because they were so many in number, one chosen\nout of each tribe, and a clerk or secretary who made\nup the eleventh. Their duty it was to look to the exe-\ncution of the laws: they had authority to seize robbers\nand other capital offenders; and if they confessed, to\nput them to death. Dr Potter thinks they resembled\nour sheriffs. The Phylarchi were the presidents of the\nAthenian tribes; but in time this became a military\ntitle. The Philobatleus was an officer in each tribe,\nwho did the same things within his jurisdiction as the\nBatiotes did with respect to the state. The Demarchi\nwere the principal magistrates in wards. The Lexar-\nchii were fix in number, and were bound to take care\nthat the people came duly to the assemblies; in their\ncustody was the public register of the citizens names.\nThey had under them Toxotae, who were victors or\nbailliffs; they were sometimes 1000 in number: these\nmen were necessary: but, like most of their fort, were\nin a manner infamous, as may be gathered from the\ncomedies of Aristophanes; they were generally Scy-\nthians, raw-boned, brawny fellows, ready to execute\nanything they were commanded. The Nomothetae\nwere 1000 in number; their business was to watch\nover and inspect into the laws. There were two sorts\nof orators in the service of the state. Some were ap-\npointed to defend an old law, when a motion was made\nto repeal it; these had their fees from the state, but the\nsame man was incapable of being elected twice. Be-\nsides these, there were 10 settled orators called Rheto-\nrers, elected by lot; their business was to plead public\ncauses in the senate house. For this they had their sta-\nted fees; and with respect to their qualifications, the\nlaw run thus: \"Let no one be a public orator who\nhath struck his parents, denied them maintenance, or\nflouted them out of his doors; who hath refused to serve\nin the army; who hath thrown away his shield; who\nhath been addicted to lewd women, notoriously effem-\ninate, or has run out his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PATRIMONY\">patrimony</a>. If any man who\nhas been guilty of these crimes dare to deliver an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORA\">ora</a>-\ntion, let him be brought to trial upon the spot. Let\nan orator have children lawfully begotten, and an\nestate within Attica; if in his oration he talks imperti-\nnently, makes idle repetitions, affects an unbecoming\nrailery, digresses from the point in question, or, after\nthe assembly is over, abuses the president, let the Pro-\nedri fine him 50 drachms; and if that is not thought\nenough, let him be brought before the next assembly\nand fined again.\"\n\nWe shall conclude this draught of the Athenian go-\nvernment with an account of their courts of justice,\nwhich, exclusive of the Areopagus, were 10 in num-\nber; four had cognizance of criminal, and six of civil\ncauses. These 10 courts were numbered with the 10\nfirst.\nfirst letters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a>, and were thence styled, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPHA\">Alpha</a>, Beta, Gamma, &c. When an Athenian was at leisure to hear causes, he wrote his own name, that of his father, and the ward to which he belonged, upon a tablet; this he presented to the Thesmothetae, who returned it again to him with another tablet, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> which fell to his lot; then he went to the crier of the court, who presented him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCEPTRE\">sceptre</a>, and gave him admission. When the causes were over, every judge went and delivered his sceptre to the Prytanes, and received a stated fee for every cause that was tried. But this was intended only to compensate their loss of time; so, that there might be no appearance of covetousness, a man was forbid to sit in two courts on the same day. The first criminal court after the Areopagus, was that of the Ephetae. It consisted of 51 members, all upwards of 51 years old. Draco gave it a very extensive jurisdiction; but Solon took away from them the power of judging in any other causes than those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANSLAUGHTER\">manslaughter</a>, accidental killing, and lying in wait to destroy: the Buleus entered all causes in this court. The second criminal court was called Delphinion, because it was held in the temple of Apollo Delphinius; it had cognizance of such murders as were committed by the criminal, but at the same time justified under some pretence or other. The Prytaneum was the third criminal court. It held <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEA\">plea</a> of such cases where death ensued from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INANIMATE\">inanimate</a> things: causes were heard here with the same solemnity as in other courts; and on judgment given, the thing, whatever it was, that had occasioned the death of a man, was thrown out of the territory of Athens. The last criminal court was styled Phreatium. It sat in a place not far from the sea shore; and such persons were brought before this court as had committed murders in their own country and fled to Attica; the proceedings of this court were so severe, that they did not permit the criminal to come on shore, but obliged him to plead his cause in his vessel; and if he was found guilty, he was committed to the mercy of the winds and seas.\n\nOf the judicatures for hearing civil causes, the first was the Parabagion, so called, as some think, because in it no matter could be heard if the cause of action was above one drachm. The Caimon, or new court, was the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a>. The third was styled the court of Lycur, because it assembled in a temple dedicated to that hero, whose statue, represented with the face of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLF\">wolf</a>, was set up in all courts of justice. The Trigonon was so called, because it was triangular in its form. The court Meridius derived its appellation from the architect who built it. The fifth and last court was called Heliaea; it was by far the greatest, and is generally conceived to have derived its name from the judges fitting in the open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> exposed to the sun. All the Athenians who were free citizens were allowed by law to sit in these courts as judges; but before they took their seats were sworn by Apollo Patroos, Ceres, and Jupiter the king, that they would decide all things righteously and according to law, where there was any law to guide them; and by the rules of natural equity, where there was none. The Heliaecic court consisted at least of 50, but its usual number was 500, judges; when causes of very great consequence were to be tried, 1000 sat therein; and now and then the judges were increased to 1500, and even to 2000. There were many inferior courts in Athens for the decision of trivial causes; but of these there is no necessity of speaking, since we design no more than a succinct view of the Athenian republic, as it was settled by and in consequence of Solon's laws.","sp":274,"ep":306},{"h":"ATTICUS","t":"Titus Pomponius, one of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> men of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Rome.

These attorneys are now formed into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> corps; they are admitted to the execution of their office by the superior courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HALL\">hall</a>; and are in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> officers of the respective courts in which they are admitted; and as they have many privileges on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of their attendance there, so they are peculiarly subject to the censure and animadversion of the judges. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> can practise as an attorney in any of those courts, but such as is admitted and sworn an attorney of that particular court: an attorney of the court of king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENCH\">bench</a> cannot practise in the court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> pleas; nor vice versa.

Ap. Nov. in Introd. And he pronounces more positively, that no bodies whatsoever were absolutely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, but only relatively so; and consequently, that all matter was subjected to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>.

In France it was received by Fermat and Roberval; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> by Galileo and Borelli. But till Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton appeared, this principle was very imperfectly defined and applied.\n\nIt must be observed, that though this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> author makes use of the word attraction, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> with the school philosophers; yet he very studiously distinguishes between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> attraction was supposed a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, inherent in certain bodies themselves, and arising from their particular or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> forms. The Newtonian attraction is a more indefinite principle; denoting not any particular kind or manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, nor the physical cause of such action; but only a tendency in the general, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONATUS\">conatus</a> accedendi, to whatever cause, physical or metaphysical, such effect be owing; whether to a power inherent in the bodies themselves, or to the impulse of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>. Accordingly, that author, in his Philosop. Nat. Prin. Math. notes, \"that he uses the words attraction, impulse, and propensity to the centre, indifferently; and cautions the reader not to imagine that...\"\nAttraction by attraction he expresses the modus of the action, or the efficient cause thereof, as if there were any proper powers in the centres, which in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> are only mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>; or as if centres could attract,\" lib. i. p. 5. So he \" considers centripetal powers as attractions, though, physically speaking, it were perhaps more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> them impulses.\" ib. p. 147. He adds, \"that what he calls attraction may possibly be effected by impulse, though not a common or corporeal impulse, or after some other manner unknown to us,\" Optic. p. 322.\n\nAttraction, if considered as a quality arising from the specific forms of bodies, ought, together with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYMPATHY\">sympathy</a>, antipathy, and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCULT\">occult</a> qualities, to be exploded. But when we have set these aside, there <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> remain innumerable phenomena of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and particularly the gravity or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of bodies, or their tendency to a centre, which argue a principle of action seemingly distinct from impulse, where at least there is no sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPULSION\">impulsion</a> concerned. Nay, what is more, this action in some respects differs from all impulsion we know of; impulse being always found to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the surfaces of bodies, whereas gravity acts according to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> content, and consequently must arise from some cause that penetrates or pervades the whole substance thereof. This unknown principle, unknown we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> in respect of its cause, for its phenomena and effects are most obvious, with all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> and modifications thereof, we call attraction; which is a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, under which all mutual tendencies, where no physical impulse appears, and which cannot therefore be accounted for from any known laws of nature, may be ranged.\n\nAnd hence arise divers particular kinds of attraction; as, Gravity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGNETISM\">Magnetism</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">Electricity</a>, &c. which are so many different principles acting by different laws, and only agreeing in this, that we do not see any physical causes thereof; but that, as to our senses, they may really arise from some power or efficacy in such bodies, whereby they are enabled to act even upon distant bodies, though our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> absolutely disallows of any such action.\n\nAttraction may be divided, with respect to the law it observes, into two kinds.\n\n1. That which extends to a sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>. Such are the attraction of gravity, found in all bodies; and the attraction of magnetism and electricity, found in particular bodies. The several laws and phenomena of each, see under their respective <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>.\n\nThe attraction of gravity, called also among mathematicians the centripetal force, is one of the greatest and most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> principles in all nature. We see and feel it operate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> bodies near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and find by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> that the same power (i.e. a power which acts in the same manner, and by the same rules, viz. always proportionably to the quantities of matter, and as the squares of the distances reciprocally) does also obtain in the moon, and the other planets <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> and secondary, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as in the comets; and even that this is the very power whereby they are all retained in their orbits, &c. And hence, as gravity is found in all the bodies which come under our observation, it is easily inferred, by one of the settled rules of philosophy, that it obtains in all others: and as it is found to be as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of matter in each body, it must\n\nVol. III. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">Part</a> I.\nAttraction rent bodies; stronger, e.g., between the particles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POTASH\">potash</a> and those of nitric acid than those of silver, between nitric acid and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a> than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, between iron and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> than silver or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>. So sulphuric acid acts on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, but more on iron or copper, &c.\n\nThe other experiments which countenance the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of such principle of attraction in the particles of matter are innumerable.\n\nThese actions, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> whereof the particles of the bodies above mentioned tend towards each other, the author calls by a general indefinite name attraction; which is equally applicable to all actions whereby distant bodies tend towards one another, whether by impulse or by any other more latent power: and from hence he accounts for an infinity of phenomena, otherwise inexplicable, to which the principle of gravity is inadequate.\n\nThus (adds our author) will nature be found very conformable to herself and very simple; performing all the great motions of the heavenly bodies by the attraction of gravity, which intercedes those bodies, and almost all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> ones of their parts, by some other attractive power diffused through the particles thereof. Without such principles, there never would have been any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> in the world; and without the continuance thereof, motion would soon perish, there being otherwise a great decrease or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> thereof, which is only supplied by these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> principles.\n\nWe need not say how unjust it is in the generality of foreign philosophers to declare against a principle which furnishes so beautiful a view, for no other reason but because they cannot conceive how one body should act on another at a distance. It is certain, philosophy allows of no action but what is by immediate contact and impulsion (for how can a body exert any active power there where it does not exist? to suppose this of anything, even the Supreme Being himself, would perhaps imply a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>): yet we see effects without seeing any such impulse; and where there are effects, we can easily infer there are causes whether we see them or not. But a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> may consider such effects without entering into the consideration of the causes, as indeed it seems the business of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> to do: for to exclude a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of phenomena which we do see, will be to leave a great chasm in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of nature; and to argue about actions which we do not see, will be to build castles in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>.\u2014It follows, therefore, that the phenomena of attraction are matter of physical consideration, and as such entitled to a share in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of physics; but that the causes thereof will only become so when they become sensible, i.e., when they appear to be the effect of some other higher cause (for a cause is no otherwise seen than as itself is an effect, so that the first cause must from the nature of things be invisible): we are therefore at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to suppose the causes of attractions what we please, without any injury to the effects.\u2014The illustrious author himself seems a little irresolute as to the causes; inclining sometimes to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> gravity to the action of an immaterial cause (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">Optics</a>, p. 343, &c.) and sometimes to that of a material one (ib. p. 325.)\n\nIn his philosophy, the research into causes is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> thing, and never comes under consideration till the laws and phenomena of the effect be settled; it being to these phenomena that the cause is to be accommodated. The cause even of any, the grossest and most sensible action, is not adequately known. How impulse or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERCUSSION\">percussion</a> itself produces its effects, i.e., how motion is communicated by body to body, confounds the deepest philosophers; yet is impulse received not only into philosophy, but into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>: and accordingly the laws and phenomena of its effects make the greatest part of common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>.\n\nThe other species of attraction, therefore, in which no impulse is remarkable, when their phenomena are sufficiently ascertained, have the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> to be promoted from physical to mathematical consideration; and this without any previous inquiry into their causes, which our conceptions may not be proportionate to: let their causes be occult, as all causes strictly speaking are, so that their effects, which alone immediately concern us, be but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>.\n\nOur great philosopher, then, far from adulterating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> with any thing foreign or metaphysical, as many have reproached him with doing, has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of having thrown every thing of this kind out of his system, and of having opened a new source of sublimer mechanics, which duly cultivated might be of infinitely greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> than all the mechanics yet known. It is hence alone we must expect to learn the manner of the changes, productions, generations, corruptions, &c. of natural things; with all that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of wonders opened to us by the operations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>.\n\nSome of our own countrymen have prosecuted the discovery with laudable zeal: Dr Keill particularly has endeavoured to deduce some of the laws of this new action, and applied them to solve divers of the more general phenomena of bodies, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a>, fluidity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>, softness, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a>, coagulation, &c.; and Dr Freund, seconding him, has made a further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of the same principles, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> at once for almost all the phenomena that chemistry presents: so that some philosophers are inclined to think that the new mechanics should seem already raised to a complete science, and that nothing now can occur but what we have an immediate solution of from the attractive force.\n\nBut this seems a little too precipitate: A principle so fertile should have been further explored; its particular laws, limits, &c. more industriously detected and laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, before we had proceeded to the application. Attraction in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> is so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a> a thing, that it may solve a thousand different phenomena alike. The notion is but one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> more simple and precise than action itself; and, till more of its properties are ascertained, it were better to apply it less and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> it more. It may be added, that some of Sir Isaac Newton's followers have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with falling into that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> which he industriously avoided, viz. of considering attraction as a cause or active <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> in bodies, not merely as a phenomenon or effect.\n\nAttraction of Mountains.

He never made any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> progress in that art; so that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol17.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a> are held in little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> no estimation. Yet though he acquired no great reputation by his own works, it was no small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to him to be the father of three great artists, German, Claude, and Girard; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> of whom has immortalized the name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>. Claude Audran retired from Paris to Lyons, where he resided, and died in 1677.\n\nAudran, Carl, a very eminent engraver, was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> to the preceding, though some assert he was only his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a>-german; and was born at Paris in 1594. In his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a> he discovered much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, and a great disposition for the arts; and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> himself in engraving, which he appears to have been chiefly fond of, he went to Rome, where he produced several prints that did him great honour. At his return, he adopted that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of engraving which is performed with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAVER\">graver</a> only. He settled at Paris, where he died in 1674, without having ever been married. The Abb\u00e9 Marolles, who always speaks of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol3.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> with great praise, attributes 130 prints to him: amongst which, the annunciation, a middle-sized plate, upright, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HANNIBAL\">Hannibal</a> Carracci; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a>, in a circle, from Domenichino, are the most esteemed. In the early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his life he marked his prints with C, or the name of Carl, till his brother Claude published some plates with the initial only of his baptismal.\nAudran, Germain, the eldest son of Claude, mentioned in the preceding article but one, was born in 1631 at Lyons, where his parents then resided. Not content with the instructions of his father, he went to Paris, and perfected himself under his uncle Carl; so that, upon his return to Lyons, he published several prints which did great honour to his graver. His merit was in such estimation, that he was made a member of the academy established in that town, and chosen a professor. He died at Lyons in 1710, and left behind him four sons, all artists; namely, Claude, Beno\u00eet, John, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a>.\n\nAudran, Claude, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> of this name, and second son to Claude above-mentioned, was born at Lyons in 1639, and went to Rome to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>; where he succeeded so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>, that at his return he was employed by Le Brun to assist him in the battles of Alexander, which he was then painting for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a> of France. He was received into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Academy in the year 1675, and died unmarried at Paris in 1684. His virtues (says Abb\u00e9 Fontenai) were as praiseworthy as his talents were great. M. Heineken mentions this artist as an engraver, without specifying any of his works in that line.\n\nAudran, Girard, or Gerard, the most celebrated artist of the whole family of the Audrans, was the third son of Claude Audran mentioned in a preceding article, and born at Lyons in 1640. He learned from his father the first principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> and engraving; and following the example of his brother, he left Lyons and went to Paris, where his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> soon began to manifest itself. His reputation there brought him to the knowledge of Le Brun, who employed him to engrave the battles of Conquering, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>; and for these works he obtained apartments at the Gobelins. At Rome, whither he went for improvement, he is said to have studied under Carlo Maratti, in order to perfect himself in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a>; and in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, where he resided three years, he engraved several fine plates. M. Colbert, that great encourager of the arts, was so struck with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of Audran's works whilst he resided at Rome, that he persuaded Louis XIV. to recall him. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">On</a> his return, he applied himself assiduously to engraving; and was appointed engraver to the king, from whom he received great encouragement. In the year 1681 he was named councillor of the Royal Academy; and died at Paris in 1703. He had been married; but left no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> behind him.\n\nThe great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-EXCELLENCY\">excellency</a> of this artist above that of any other engraver was, that though he drew admirably himself, yet he contrived no manner of his own; but transcribed on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> simply, with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> whose pictures he copied. On viewing his prints you lose sight of the engraver, and naturally say, it is Le Brun, it is Poullin, it is Mignard, or it is Le Sueur, &c. as you turn to the prints which he engraved from those masters. Let any one examine the battles above-mentioned from Le Brun, the preservation of the young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PYRRHUS\">Pyrrhus</a> from Nicholas Poullin, the peafowl from Mignard, and the martyrdom of St Lawrence from Le Sueur, and then judge candidly of the truth of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>. The following judicious observations by the Abb\u00e9 Fontenai, taken chiefly from M. Bafan, with some small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> and additions, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> fully illustrate the merits of Gerard Audran. \"This sublime <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICER\">artificer</a>, far from conceiving that a servile arrangement of strokes, and the too frequently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and affected clearness of the graver, were the great essentials of historical engraving, gave worth to his works by a bold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of free hatchings and dots, placed together apparently without order, but with an inimitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of taste; and has left to posterity most admirable examples of the style in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> compositions ought to be treated. His greatest works, which have not a very flattering appearance to the ignorant eye, are the admiration of true connoisseurs and persons of fine taste. He acquired the most profound knowledge of the art by the constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> and study which he bestowed upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> of design, and the frequent use he made of painting from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. This great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> always knew how to penetrate into the genius of the painter he copied from; often improved upon, and sometimes even surpassed him. Without exception, he was the most celebrated engraver that ever existed in the historical line. We have several subjects which he engraved from his own designs, that manifested as much taste as character and facility. But, in the battles of Alexander, he surpassed even the expectations of Le Brun himself.\" These consist of three very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> prints, lengthwise, each consisting of four plates, which join together, from Le Brun; namely, the passage of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRANICUS\">Granicus</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Arbela; Porus brought to Alexander, after his defeat. To this set are added two more large prints lengthwise, on two plates each, also from Le Brun, as follow: Alexander entering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-TENT\">tent</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DARIUS\">Darius</a>; and The triumphal entry of Alexander into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLON\">Babylon</a>. The former was engraved by Gerard Edelink, and the latter by Gerard Audran. It is to be remarked of all these plates, that those impressions are generally most esteemed which have the name of Guyon the printer marked upon them. The Peafowl from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> Mignard, a large plate, lengthwise, also deserves particular notice. In the first impressions, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> in the clouds is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNO\">Juno</a> with her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PEACOCK\">peacock</a> behind her; in the latter, the peacock is obliterated, and the wings of an angel are added to the figure.\n\nAudran, Beno\u00eet, the second son of Germain Audran, was born at Lyons in 1661, where he learned the first principles of design and engraving under the instruction of his father. But soon after going to Paris, his uncle Gerard Audran took him under his tuition; and Beno\u00eet so greatly profited by his instructions, that though he never equalled the sublime style of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a>, yet he deservedly acquired great reputation. Nay, the Abb\u00e9 Fontenai adds this eulogy: \"We admire in his works a share of those beauties which we find in the engravings of the illustrious Gerard.\" He was honoured with the appellation of the king's engraver, and received the royal pension. He was made an academician, and admitted into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> in 1715. He died unmarried at Louzouer, where he had an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a>, in 1721. His manner was founded upon the bold clear style of his uncle. His outlines were firm and determined; his drawing correct; the heads of his figures are in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> very expressive; and the\nAudran, the other extremities well marked. His works, when compared with those of his uncle, appear to want that mellowness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> which are so conspicuous in the latter; they are more dry; and the round dots with which he finished his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> upon the lights are often too predominant. In his most finished plates, we find the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> part of the engraving extremely neat, and managed with great taste and judgment. Among his neatest prints may be reckoned that which represents Alexander sick, drinking from the cup which his physician presents to him: a circular plate, from Le Sueur.\n\nAudran, John, the third son of Germain Audran, was born at Lyons in 1667; and, after having received instructions from his father, went to Paris to perfect himself in the art of engraving under his uncle Gerard Audran. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 20 years, the genius of this great artist began to display itself in a surprising manner; and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> success was such, that in 1707, he obtained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of engraver to the king, and had a pension allowed him by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a>, with apartments in the Gobelins; and the following year he was made a member of the Royal Academy. He was 80 years of age before he quitted the graver; and near 90 when he died at his apartments assigned him by the king. He left three sons behind him; one of whom was also an engraver, as we shall see below. \"The most masterly and best prints of this artist (in Mr Strutt's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>) are those which are not so pleasing to the eye at first sight. In these the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETCHING\">etching</a> constitutes a great part; and he has finished them in a bold rough style. The scientific <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of the master appears in them on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>. The drawing of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> figure, where it is shown, is correct. The heads are expressive and finely finished; the other extremities well marked. He has not, however, equaled his uncle. He wants that harmony in the effect; his lights are too much and too equally covered; and there is not sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the style in which he has engraved his backgrounds and his draperies. This observation refers to a fine print by him of Athaliah, and such as he engraved in that style. At other times he seems almost to have quitted the point, and substituted the graver. But here I think he has not so well succeeded. The effect is cold and silvery: see, for example, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANDROMACHE\">Andromache</a> from Sylvestre. One of his best finished prints, in this neat style, seems to me to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUPID\">Cupid</a> and Psyche from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANT\">Ant</a>. Corneil.\"\n\nAudran, Louis, the last son of Germain Audran, was born at Lyons in 1670; from whence he went to Paris, after the example of his brothers, to complete his studies in the school of his uncle Gerard. He died suddenly at Paris in 1712, before he had produced any great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of prints by his own hand. He assisted, it is presumed, his brothers in their more extensive works. Among the most esteemed prints by this artist are the seven acts of mercy, on seven middling sized plates, lengthwise, from Sebastian Bourdon.\n\nAudran, Beno\u00eet, the second engraver of that name, was the son of John Audran, and nephew to the former Beno\u00eet; and was also established at Paris.

It is now so generally known, that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> is requisite of the appearance which it usually makes in this country. But it is in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCTIC\">arctic</a> regions that it appears in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>, particularly during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLSTICE\">solstice</a>. In the Shetland islands, the merry dancers, as they are there called, are the constant attendants of clear evenings, and prove <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> reliefs amidst the gloom of the long winter nights. They commonly appear at twilight near the horizon, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUN\">dun</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>; sometimes continuing in that state for several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> without any sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>; after which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> out into streams of stronger light, spreading into columns, and altering slowly into ten thousand different shapes, varying their colours from all the tints of yellow to the obscurest ruddiness. They often cover the whole hemisphere, and then make the most brilliant appearance. Their motions at these times are most amazingly quick; and they astonish the spectator with the rapid change of their form. They break out in places where none were seen before (skimming briskly along the heavens) are suddenly extinguished, and leave behind an uniform dusky tract. This again is brilliantly illuminated in the same manner, and as suddenly left a dull blank.\n\nIn certain nights they assume the appearance of vast columns, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> one side of the deepest yellow, on the other declining away till it becomes undistinguishable from the sky. They have generally a strong tremulous motion from end to end, which continues till the whole vanishes. In a word, we, who only see the extremities of these northern phenomena, have but a faint idea of their splendour and their motions. According to the state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, they differ in colours. They often put on the colour of blood, and make a most dreadful appearance. The ruddy tinges become prophetic, and terrify the gazing spectators with the dread of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, pestilence, and famine. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> was not peculiar to the northern islands; nor are these appearances of recent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>. The ancients called them Chasmata, and Trabes, and Bolides, according to their forms or colours.\n\nIn old times they were extremely rare, and on that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> were the more taken notice of. From the days of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-PLUTARCH\">Plutarch</a> to those of our sage historian Sir Richard Baker, they were supposed to have been portentous of great events, and timid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> flamed them into aerial conflicts:\n\nFierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds\nIn ranks and squadrons and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> form of war.\n\nDr Halley tells us, that when he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> a great aurora borealis in 1716, he had begun to despair of ever seeing one at all; none having appeared, at least in any considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, from the time he was born till then. Notwithstanding this long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, however, it seems that in some periods the aurora borealis had been seen much more frequently; and perhaps this, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> phenomena, may have some stated times of returning.\n\nThe only thing that resembles a distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of this phenomenon, is what we have from the learned Dr Halley, Phil. Trans. No. 347. The first account he gives, is of the appearance of what is called by the author <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> spears, and was seen at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 30th, 1560. This account is taken from a book entitled, A Description of Meteors, by W. F. D. D., and reprinted at London in 1654. The next appearance, on the testimony of Stow, was on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a> 7th, 1564. In 1574 also, according to Camden, and Stow above-mentioned, an aurora borealis was observed two nights successively, viz. on the 14th and 15th of November, with much the same appearances as described by Dr Halley in 1716, and which we now so frequently observe. Again, the same was twice seen in Brabant, in the year 1575; viz. on the 13th of February and 28th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>. Its appearances at both these times were described by Cornelius Gemma, professor of medicine in the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOUVAIN\">Louvain</a>, who compares them to spears, fortified cities, and armies fighting in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. After this, Michael Maestlin, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> to the great Kepler, assures us, that at Bakenang in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of Wurttemberg in Germany, these phenomena, which he styles chasmata, were seen by himself no less than seven times in 1580. In 1581, they again appeared in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> manner in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> and September, and in a less degree at some other times of the same year. In 1621, September 2d, this phenomenon was observed all over France,\nFrance, and described by Gassendus, who gave it the name of aurora borealis: yet neither this, nor any similar appearances <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> to 1574, are described by English writers till the year 1707; which, as Dr Halley observes, shows the prodigious neglect of curious matters which at that time prevailed. From 1621 to 1707, indeed, there is no mention made of an aurora borealis being seen by any body; and considering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of astronomers who during that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> were in a manner continually poring on the heavens, we may very reasonably conclude that no such thing did make its appearance till after an interval of 86 years. In 1707, a small one was seen in November; and during that year and the next, the same appearances were repeated five times. The next on record is that mentioned by Dr Halley in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1715\u201416, the brilliancy of which attracted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, and by the vulgar was considered as marking the introduction of a foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of princes. Since that time those meteors have been so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>, that no accounts have been kept of them.\n\nIt was for a long time a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of doubt whether this meteor made its appearance only in the northern hemisphere, or whether it was also to be observed near the south pole. This is now ascertained by Mr Foster; who in his late voyage round the world along with Captain Cook, affirms us, that he observed them in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> southern latitudes, though with phenomena somewhat different from those which are seen here. On Feb. 17, 1773, as they were in Lat. 58\u00b0 south, \"A beautiful phenomenon (says he) was observed during the preceding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, which appeared again this and several following nights. It consisted of long columns of a clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> light, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> up from the horizon to the eastward, almost to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZENITH\">zenith</a>, and gradually spreading on the whole southern part of the sky. These columns were sometimes bent sidewise at their upper extremities; and though in most respects similar to the northern lights (aurora borealis) of our hemisphere, yet differed from them in being always of a whitish colour, whereas ours affume various tints, especially those of a fiery and purple hue. The sky was generally clear when they appeared, and the air sharp and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, the thermometer standing at the freezing point.\"\n\nDr Halley observed that the aurora borealis described by him arose to a prodigious height, it being seen from the west of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> to the confines of Russia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a>; nor did he know how much further it might have been visible; so that it extended at least 30 degrees in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>, and from Lat. 50\u00b0 north it was seen over all the northern part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>; and what was very surprising, in all those places where it was visible, the same appearances were exhibited which Dr Halley observed at London. He observes, with seeming regret, that he could by no means determine its height, for want of observations made at different places; otherwise he might as easily have calculated the height of this aurora borealis, as he did of the fiery globe in 1719*. To other philosophers, however, he gives the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXHORTATION\">exhortation</a>. \"When therefore for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> any such thing shall happen, all those that are curious in astronomical matters are hereby admonished and entreated to let their clocks to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> time at London, for example, by allowing for many minutes as is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of meridians; and then to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, at the end of every half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> precisely, the exact situation of what at that time appears remarkable in the sky; and particularly the azimuths of those very tall pyramids so eminent above the rest, and therefore likely to be seen furthest: to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENT\">intent</a> that, by comparing these observations taken at the same moment in distant places, the difference of their azimuths may serve to determine how far these pyramids are distant from us.\" This advice of Dr Halley seems to have been totally neglected by all the philosophical people in his country. In other countries, however, they have been more industrious. Father Boscovich has determined the height of an aurora borealis, observed on the 16th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1737 by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARQUIS\">marquis</a> of Poletti, to have been 825 miles high; the celebrated Mr Bergman, from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> of 30 computations, makes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> height of the aurora borealis to be 70 Swedish, or upwards of 450 English miles. Euler supposes it to be several thousands of miles high; and Mairet also affirms them a very elevated region. In the 7th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Philosophical Transactions, Dr Blagden, when speaking of the height of some fiery meteors, tells us, that the \"aurora borealis appears to occupy as high, if not a higher region above the surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, as may be judged from the very distant countries to which it has been visible at the same time.\" The height of these meteors, however, none of which appear to have exceeded or even arrived at the height of a hundred miles, must appear trifling in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the vast elevations above mentioned. But these enormous heights, varying so exceedingly, show that the calculators have not had proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> to proceed upon; and indeed the immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of space occupied by the aurora borealis itself, with its constant motion, must make it infinitely more difficult to determine the height of it than of a fiery globe, which occupies but a small portion of the visible heavens. The most certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of making a comparison between the aurora borealis and the meteors already mentioned, would be, if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> of fire should happen to pass through the same part of the heavens where an aurora borealis was; when the comparative height of both could easily be ascertained. One instance of this only has come under our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, where one of the small meteors, called falling stars, was evidently obscured by an aurora borealis; and therefore must have been higher than the lower part of the latter at least. A singularity in this meteor was, that it did not proceed in a straight line through the heavens, as is usual with falling stars, but described a very considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of a circle, rising in the north-west, and proceeding southward a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> in the arch of a circle, and disappearing in the north. Its edges were ill defined, and five or six coruscations seemed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> from it like the rays painted as issuing from stars. The aurora borealis was not in motion, but had degenerated into a crepuscule in the northern part of the hemisphere. Indeed, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> this kind of crepuscule appears so plainly to be connected with the clouds, that we can scarcely avoid supposing it to proceed from them. We cannot, however, argue from this to the height of the aurora borealis when it moves with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a>, because it then may, and very probably does, ascend much higher. Dr Blagden, in\nAurora Borealis\n\ndeed, informs us, that instances are recorded, where the northern lights have been seen to join, and form <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> balls, darting about with great velocity, and even leaving a train like the common fire-balls. It would seem, therefore, that the highest regions of the aurora borealis are the same with those in which fire balls move.\n\nWith regard to the cause of the aurora borealis naturally occurring was, that it was occasioned by the ascent of inflammable sulphureous vapours from the earth. To this supposition Dr Halley objects the immense extent of such phenomena, and that they are constantly observed to proceed from north to south, but never from south to north. This made him very reasonably conclude, that there was some connexion between the poles of the earth and the aurora borealis; but being unacquainted with the electric power, he supposed, that this earth was hollow, having within it a magnetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a>, which corresponded in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> with all the natural and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> magnets on the surface; and the magnetic effluvia passing through the earth, from one pole of the central magnet to another, might sometimes become visible, in their course, which he thought was from north to south, and thus exhibit the beautiful coruscations of the aurora borealis. Had Dr Halley, however, known that a stroke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a> would give polarity to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a> that had it not, or reverse the poles of one that had it before, he would undoubtedly have concluded the electric and magnetic effluvia to be the same, and that the aurora borealis was this fluid performing its circulation from one pole of the earth to the other. In fact, this very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> is adapted by S. Beccaria; and by the supposed circulation of the electric fluid he accounts for the phenomena of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGNETISM\">magnetism</a> and the aurora borealis in a manner perfectly similar to that of Dr Halley, only changing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a> magnetic effluvia for electric fluid. The following is the account given us by Dr Priestley of Beccaria's sentiments on this matter.\n\n\"Since a sudden stroke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a> gives polarity to magnets, he conjectures, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> and constant circulation of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of the fluid from north to south may be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> cause of magnetism in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>.\n\n\"That this ethereal current is insensible to us, is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of its non-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>, since we ourselves are involved in it. He had seen birds fly near a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>-cloud, as he was sure they would not have done had they been affected by its atmosphere.\n\n\"This current he would suppose to arise from one source, but from several, in the northern hemisphere, of the earth; and he thinks that the aurora borealis may be this electric matter performing its circulation in such a state of the atmosphere as renders it visible, or approaching the earth nearer than usual. Accordingly, very vivid appearances of this kind have been observed to occasion a fluctuation in the magnetic needle.\"\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> disproof of this circulation, however, is furnished by the observation of Mr Forster already mentioned: with which, though neither Dr Halley nor S. Beccaria could be acquainted, they might have thought of it as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> proof either of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> or falsehood of their hypothesis.\u2014If the aurora borealis is no other than the electric fluid performing the above-mentioned circulation, it ought to dart from the horizon towards the zenith in the northern hemisphere, and from the zenith to the horizon in the southern one: but Mr Forster plainly tells us, that the columns <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> up from the horizon towards the zenith as well in the southern hemisphere as in the northern; so that if the aurora borealis is to be reckoned the flittings of electric matter, its course is plainly directed from both poles toward the equator, and not from one pole to the other.\n\nConcerning the cause of this phenomenon, Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTON\">Canton</a> has the following query: \"Is not the aurora borealis the flashing of electrical fire from positive towards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> clouds at a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, through the upper part of the atmosphere where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFRACTION\">refraction</a> is least?\" But to this we must reply in the negative; for in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> it would flash in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> according to the position of the clouds, as well as from north to south. Besides this query, he conjectures, that when the needle is disturbed by the aurora borealis, that phenomenon proceeds from the electricity of the heated air; and supposes the air to have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of becoming electric by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, like the tourmalin. But neither does this hypothesis appear at all probable; because, in such a case, the aurora borealis ought to be most frequent in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> when the air is most heated, whereas it is found to be the reverse. Lastly, with these electrical hypotheses we shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> that of Mr Mairan, who imagined this phenomenon to proceed from the atmosphere of the sun, particles of which were thrown off by its centrifugal force acquired by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a>; and that these particles falling upon the atmosphere of the earth near its equatorial parts, were from thence propelled by the diurnal motion of the earth towards the polar regions, where they formed the aurora borealis. This hypothesis, besides its being a mere supposition unsupported by one single appearance in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, is liable to the objection already mentioned; for in this case the light should dart from the equator to the poles, and not from the poles to the equator: or if we should suppose this matter to be gradually accumulated at each of the poles, we must then make other suppositions equally vague and ill founded, concerning its getting back with such surprising rapidity in direct opposition to the power which once brought it thither.\n\nThe first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who seems to have endeavoured to find any positive proof of the electrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the aurora borealis, was Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>. He observes, that though this phenomenon is commonly supposed to be electrical, yet he had not seen any attempt to prove that it is so; but the only proof he himself brings is an experiment of Mr Hawkesbee, by which the electric fluid is shown to put on appearances somewhat like the aurora borealis, when it passes through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a>. He observed, that when the air was most perfectly exhausted, the streams of electric matter were then quite white; but when a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of air was let in, the light assumed more of a purple colour. The flashing of this light therefore from the dense regions of the atmosphere into such as are more rare, and the transitions through mediums of different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a>, he reckons the cause of the aurora borealis, and of the different colours it assumes.\n\nDr Hamilton's proof, then, of the electricity of the\nthe aurora borealis consists entirely in the resemblance\nthe two lights bear to one another; and if to this we\nadd, that, during the time of an aurora borealis, the\nmagnetic needle hath been disturbed, electric fire ob-\ntained from the atmosphere in plenty, and at some\ntimes different kinds of rumbling and hissing sounds\nheard, we have the sum of all the positive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> in\nfavour of the electric hypothesis.\n\nWas the aurora borealis the first natural pheno-\nmenon the solution of which had been attempted by elec-\ntricity, no doubt the proofs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> now adduced would\nbe very insufficient; but when it is considered, that we\nhave indisputable evidence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDENTITY\">identity</a> of the phe-\nnomena of thunder and of electricity; when we also\nconsider, that the higher parts of our atmosphere are\ncontinually in a strongly electrified state; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a>\nbecomes so strong that we can scarce doubt of the au-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORA\">ora</a> borealis arising from the same cause. The only\ndifficulty is, to give a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> why the electricity\nof the atmosphere should be constantly found to direct\nits course from the poles towards the equator, and not\nfrom the equator to the poles; and this we think may\nbe done in the following manner.\n\n1. It is found that all electric bodies, when consi-\nderably heated, become conductors of electricity; thus\nhot air, hot glass, melted rosin, sealing-wax, &c., are\nall conductors, till their heat is dissipated, and then\nthey again become electrics.\n\n2. As the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> of every true proposition ought\nalso to be true, it follows from the above one, that if\nelectricity when heated become conductors, then non-\nelectricity when subjected to violent degrees of cold\nought to become electric. In one instance this has\nbeen verified by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, which is a conduc-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TOR\">tor</a> when warm or not violently cooled, is found to be-\ncome electric when cooled to 20\u00b0 below 0 of Fahrenheit's thermometer. With regard to metallic substan-\nces, indeed, no experiments have as yet been made to\ndetermine whether their conducting power is affected\nby cold or not. Very probably we might not be able\nto produce such a degree of cold as sensibly to lessen\ntheir conducting power; but still the analogy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>\nhold; and, as we are by no means able to produce the\ngreatest degree of cold possible, reason will always sug-\ngest to us, that if a certain degree of cold changes one\nconductor into an electric, a sufficient degree of it will\nalso change all others into electrics.\n\n3. If cold is sufficient to change conducting sub-\nstances into electrics, it must also increase the electric\npower of such substances as are already electric; that\nis to say, very cold air, glass, rosin, &c., provided they\nare dry, will be more electric than when they are warmer. With regard to air, which is most to our\npresent purpose, this is rendered extremely probable,\nby considering that clear frosty weather is of all others\nthe most favourable for electric experiments. They\nmay be made indeed to equal advantage almost in any\nstate of the atmosphere, provided sufficient pains are\nused, but in dry hard frosts they will succeed much\nmore easily than at any other time.\n\nThese three axioms being allowed, the cause of the\naurora borealis is easily deduced from them. The air,\nall round the globe, at a certain height above its sur-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, is found to be exceedingly cold, and, as far as\nexperiments have yet determined, exceedingly electro-\ncal also. The inferior parts of the atmosphere between\nthe tropics, are violently heated during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>-time\nby the reflection of the sun's rays from the earth.\nSuch air will therefore be a kind of conductor, and\nmuch more readily part with its electricity to the\nclouds and vapours floating in it, than the colder air\ntowards the north and south poles. Hence the prodig-\nious appearances of electricity in these regions, show-\ning itself in thunder and other tempests of the most\nterrible kind. Immense quantities of the electric fluid\nare thus communicated to the earth; and the inferior\nwarm atmosphere having once exhausted itself, must ne-\ncessarily be recruited from the upper and colder <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-\ngion. This becomes very probable from what the\nFrench mathematicians observed when on the top of\none of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANDES\">Andes</a>. They were often involved in\nclouds, which, sinking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> into the warmer air, ap-\npeared there to be highly electrified, and discharged\nthemselves in violent tempests of thunder and light-\nning; while in the mean time, on the top of the\nmountain, they enjoyed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> and serene sky. In the\ntemperate and frigid zones, the inferior parts of the\natmosphere never being so strongly heated, do not part\nwith their electricity so easily as in the torrid zone,\nand consequently do not require such recruits from the\nupper regions; but notwithstanding the difference of\nheat observed in different parts of the earth near the\nsurface, it is very probable that at considerable heights\nthe degrees of cold are nearly equal all round it. Were\nthere a like equality in the heat of the under part,\nthere could never be any considerable loss of equili-\nbrium in the electricity of the atmosphere; but as the\nhot air of the torrid zone is perpetually bringing down\nvast quantities of electric matter from the cold air that\nlies directly above it; and as the inferior parts of the\natmosphere lying towards the north and south poles do\nnot conduct in any great degree; it thence follows,\nthat the upper parts of the atmosphere lying over the\ntorrid zone will continually require a supply from the\nnorthern and southern regions. This easily shows the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of an electric current in the upper parts of the\natmosphere from each pole towards the equator; and\nthus we are also furnished with a reason why the au-\nora borealis appears more frequently in winter than\nin summer; namely, because at that time the electric\npower of the inferior atmosphere is greater on account\nof the cold than in summer; and consequently the\nabundant electricity of the upper regions must go al-\nmost wholly off to the equatorial parts, it being impos-\nsible for it to get down to the earth; hence also the\naurora borealis appears very frequent and bright in the\nfrigid zones, the degree of cold in the upper and un-\nder regions of the atmosphere being much more nearly\nequal in these parts than in any other. In some parts\nof <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a> particularly, this meteor appears constantly\nfrom October to Christmas, and its coruscations are\nsaid to be very terrifying. Travellers agree, that here\nthe aurora borealis appears in greatest perfection; and\nit is to be remarked, that Siberia is the coldest coun-\ntry on earth. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of this, it may also be\nobserved, that, from the experiments hitherto made\nwith the electrical kite, the air appears considerably\nmore electrical in winter than in summer, though the\nclouds are known to be often most violently electrified\nin the summer time; a proof, that the electricity natu-\nrally\nAurora Borealis.\n\nturally belonging to the air is in summer much more powerfully drawn off by the clouds than in the winter, owing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of heat in summer, as already observed.\n\nA considerable difficulty, however, still remains from the upright position which the streams of the aurora borealis are generally supposed to have; whereas, according to the hypothesis above mentioned, they ought rather to run directly from north to south. This difficulty occurred to Dr Halley; but he answers it by supposing his magnetic effluvia to pass from one pole to another in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> of great circles, arising to a vast height above the earth, and consequently darting from the places whence they arose almost like the radii of a circle; in which case, being sent off in a direction nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to the surface of the earth, they must necessarily appear erect to those who see them from any part of the surface, as is demonstrated by mathematicians. It is also reasonable to think that they will take this direction rather than any other, on account of their meeting with less resistance in the very high regions of the air than in such as are lower.\n\nBut the greatest difficulty still remains: for we have supposed the equilibrium of the atmosphere to be broken in the daytime, and restored only in the night; whereas, considering the immense velocity with which the electric fluid moves, the equilibrium ought to be restored in all parts almost instantaneously; yet the aurora borealis never appears except in the night, although its brightness is such as must sometimes make it visible to us did it really exist in the daytime.\n\nIn answer to this it must be observed, that though the passage of electricity through a good conductor is instantaneous, yet through a bad conductor it is observed to take some time in passing. As our atmosphere therefore, though very violently heated, is but a bad conductor of electricity; though the equilibrium in it is broken, it can by no means be instantaneously restored. Add to this, that as it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the sun which breaks the equilibrium, so the same action, extending over half the globe, prevents almost any attempt to restore it till night, when flashes arise from various parts of the atmosphere, gradually extending themselves with a variety of undulations towards the equator.\n\nIt now remains to explain only one particularity of the aurora borealis, namely, that its streams do not always move with rapidity; sometimes appearing quite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a> for a considerable time, and sometimes being carried in different directions with a slow motion. To this indeed we can give no other reply, than that weak electric lights have been sometimes observed to put on the same appearance at the surface of the earth; and much more may we suppose them capable of doing so at great heights above it, where the conductors are both fewer in number and much more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>.\n\nWhen M. de Romas was making experiments with an electric kite in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> of blue light about four or five inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> was observed surrounding the string. This was in the daytime; but had it been night, he imagined it must have been four or five feet in diameter; and as the string was 780 feet long, it would probably have seemed pyramidal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> upwards like one of the streams of the aurora borealis.\n\nA still more remarkable appearance, Dr Priestley tells us, was observed by Mr Hartman. He had been making electrical experiments for four or five hours together in a very small room; and upon going out of it, and returning with a light in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, walking pretty quick, he perceived a small flame following him at about three feet distance. Being alarmed at this appearance, he stopped to examine it, upon which it vanished. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> instance is very remarkable, and singular in its kind: from both, however, we are sufficiently warranted to conclude, that final portions of our atmosphere may by various causes be so much electrified as to shine, and likewise be moved from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> to another without parting with the electricity they have received, for a considerable time.\n\nThe corona, or circle, which is often formed near the zenith by the aurora borealis, is easily accounted for in the same manner. As this corona is commonly stationary for some time, we imagine it would be a very proper mark whereby to determine the distance of the meteor itself. If an aurora borealis, for instance, was observed by two persons, one at London, and the other at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>; by noting the stars among which the corona was observed at each place, its true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> from the surface of the earth could easily be determined by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">trigonometry</a>.\n\nUnder the article Atmosphere it was suggested, that no good proof had been as yet brought for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> rarity of the air usually supposed to take place at no very great heights above the earth. The brightness of the meteor there mentioned at 70 miles perpendicular from the surface, as also its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, seemed to prove the air considerably denser at that distance from the earth. Though the height of the aurora borealis has never been determined, we can scarce imagine it to be greater than that of this meteor, or indeed so great; but although its streams resemble the passage of electric light through a vacuum, it cannot be from thence inferred, that the air is at all in a state similar to the vacuum of an air-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a> in those places where the aurora borealis is produced; seeing we have instances of similar appearances being produced in very dense air. The plate of an electrophorus is often so highly electrified, as to throw out flashes from different parts as soon as it is lifted up, and by proper management it may be always made to emit long and broad flashes which shall scarcely be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> by the finger, instead of small, dense, and pungent sparks; so that, though long flashes may be produced in rarefied air, it by no means follows, that the same may not also be produced in denser air. As little can we infer anything from the colours; for we observe the electric spark sometimes white, sometimes blue, and sometimes purple, in the very same state of the atmosphere, and from the same substance.\n\nThe aurora borealis is said to be attended with a peculiar hissing noise in some very cold climates; Gmelin speaks of it in the most pointed terms, as frequent and very loud in the north-eastern parts of Siberia; and other travellers have related similar facts. Gmelin's account is very remarkable. \"These northern lights (says he) begin with single bright <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILLARS\">pillars</a>, rising in the north, and almost at the same time in the north-east, which gradually increasing, comprehend a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> space of the heavens, rush about from place to place with incredible velocity, and finally almost cover the whole sky.\"\nsky up to the zenith. The streams are then seen meeting together in the zenith, and produce an appearance as if a vast extent was expanded in the heavens, glittering with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, rubies, and sapphire. A more beautiful spectacle cannot be painted; but whoever should see such a northern light for the first time, could not behold it without terror. For however fine the illumination may be, it is attended, as I have learned from the relation of many persons, with such a hissing, cracking, and rushing noise throughout the air, as if the largest fireworks were playing off. To describe what they then hear, they make use of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, Spolachi ebodjat, that is, 'the raging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLT\">holt</a> is puffing.' The hunters who pursue the white and blue foxes on the confines of the icy sea, are often overtaken in their course by these northern lights. Their dogs are then so much frightened, that they will not move, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> obstinately on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> till the noise has passed. Commonly clear and calm weather follows this kind of northern lights. I have heard this account, not from one person only, but confirmed by the uniform testimony of many, who have spent part of several years in these very northern regions, and inhabited different countries from the Yenesei to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENA\">Lena</a>; so that no doubt of its truth can remain. This seems indeed to be the real birthplace of the aurora borealis.\"\n\nThe hissing or rushing noise above described, Dr Blagden is inclined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> to small streams of electric matter running off to the earth from the mists or accumulations of electricity by which the northern lights are supposed to be produced.\n\nWe shall conclude this article with an account of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> presented to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> by Mr Winn, in 1772, wherein he says that the appearance of an aurora borealis is a certain sign of a hard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GALE\">gale</a> of wind from the south-west. This he never found to fail in 23 instances; and even thinks, that from the splendour of the meteor, some judgment may be formed concerning the ensuing tempest. If the aurora is very bright, the gale will come on within twenty-four hours, but will be of no long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>; if the light is faint and dull, the gale will be less violent, and longer in coming on, but it will also last longer. His observations were made in the English channel, where such winds are very dangerous; and by attending to the aurora, he says he often got easily out of it, when others narrowly escaped being wrecked. This is an exceedingly useful observation for sailors: but it cannot be expected that the winds succeeding these meteors should in all places blow from the south-west; though no doubt a careful observation of what winds succeed the aurora borealis, and other meteors, in different parts of the world, might contribute in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> to lessen the dangers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>.\n\nThat the aurora borealis ought to be succeeded by winds, may be easily deduced from the hypothesis last mentioned. If this phenomenon is occasioned by the vast quantity of electric matter conveyed to the equatorial parts of the earth, it is certain that the earth cannot receive any great quantity of this matter at one place without emitting it at another. The electricity, therefore, which is constantly received at the equator, must be emitted nearer the poles, in order to perform its course, otherwise there could not be a constant supply of it for the common operations of nature. It is observed, that electrified bodies are always surrounded by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BLAST\">blast</a> of air, which is sent forth from them in all directions; hence, if the electric matter find a more ready passage through one part of the earth than another, a wind will be found to blow from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>. If therefore one of these places happens to be in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATLANTIC_OCEAN\">Atlantic ocean</a> near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of France, or in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of Biscay, the electric matter which has been received at the equator during an aurora borealis will be discharged there some time after, and consequently a wind will blow from that quarter, which will be from the south-west to those ships which are in the English channel. It cannot be imagined, however, that all the matter can be discharged from one place; and therefore according to the different situations of these electrical vents, winds may blow in different directions; and thus the same aurora borealis may produce a south-west wind in the English channel, and a north-west one in Scotland.\n\nAURUM.

From them Europe received it without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of its character; in foreign pharmacopoeias it is still retained, and even mixed with the ingredients from which simple waters are to be distilled. But no one, it is presumed, at this time expects any singular virtues from it, since it certainly is not alterable in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> body. Mr Geoffroy, though unwilling to reject it from the cordial preparations, honestly acknowledges that he has no other reason for retaining it than complaisance to the Arabian schools. The chemists have endeavoured, by many elaborate processes, to extract what they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> a sulphur or anima of gold: but no method is as yet known of separating the component parts of this metal; all the tinctures of it, and aurum petteabile, which have hitherto appeared, are real solutions of it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AQUA\">aqua</a> regia, diluted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of wine or other liquors, and prove injurious to the body rather than beneficial. A place, however, is now given in some of the foreign pharmacopoeias to the aurum fulminans; and it has of late been recommended as a remedy in some convulsive diseases, particularly in the chorea famili viti.\n\nAURUM Fulminans.

Concerning Ausona or its remains there is nothing particular recorded.\n\n**Ausonia**, the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Italy, from its most ancient inhabitants the Ausones (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>, Servius).\n\n**Ausoneum Mare**, in *Ancient Geography*, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the Ionian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, extending southwards from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMONTORY\">promontory</a> Japygium to Sicily, which it washes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a>, as it does the Bruttii and Magna Graecia on the south and east. It is separated from the Tuscan sea by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRAIT\">strait</a> of Messina.\n\n**Ausonius** (in Latin, Decius, or rather Decimus, Magnus Ausonius), one of the best poets of the fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, was the son of an eminent physician, and born at Bordeaux. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">Great</a> care was taken of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> interesting themselves in it, either because his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> was very promising, or that the scheme of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATIVITY\">nativity</a>, which had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> by his grandfather on the mother's side, made them imagine that he would rise to great honour. He made an uncommon progress in classical learning, and at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 30 was chosen to teach <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a> at Bordeaux. He was promoted some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> after to be professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a>; in which office he acquired great reputation, that he was sent for to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> to be preceptor to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRATIAN\">Gratian</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Valentinian's son. The rewards and honours conferred on him for the faithful discharge of his office prove the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of Juvenal's maxim, that when Fortune pleases, she can raise a man from a rhetorician to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a>. He was actually appointed consul by the emperor Gratian, in the year 379, after having filled other considerable posts; for besides the dignity of quaestor, to which he had been nominated by Valentinian, he was made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREFECT\">prefect</a> of the praetorium in Italy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a> after that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. His speech returning thanks to Gratian on his promotion to the consulship is highly commended. The time of his death is uncertain; he was still living in 392, and lived to a great age. The emperor Theodosius had a great esteem for Ausonius, and praised him to publish his poems. There is a great inequality in his works; and in his manner and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> there is a harshness which was perhaps rather the defect of the times he lived in than of his genius. Had he lived in Augustus's reign, his verses, according to good judges, would have equalled the most finished of that age. He is generally supposed to have been a Christian; some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> authors indeed think otherwise, but, according to Mr Bayle, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>. The best edition of his poems is that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a> in 1671.\n\n**Auspeix**, a name originally given to those who were afterwards denominated augurs. In which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> the word is supposed to be formed from avus, \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a>,\" and inspiciere, \"to inspect\"; auspices, q. d. avispices. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> therefore have auspices properly to denote those who foretell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> events from the flight of birds.\n\n**Auspiciun**, **Auspicy**, the same with augury.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AUSTER\">Auster</a>**, one of the four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">cardinal</a> winds, as Servius calls them, blowing from the south, (Pliny, Ovid, Manilius.)\n\n**Austere**, rough, stringent. Thus an austere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> is such as one as constringes the mouth and tongue; as that of unripe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, harsh wines, &c.\n\n**Austerity**, among moral writers, implies severity and rigour.

It is bounded on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORAVIA\">Moravia</a>; on the east by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUNGARY\">Hungary</a>; on the south by Stiria; and on the west by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BAVARIA\">Bavaria</a>. It is divided into Upper and Lower. Upper Austria is situated on the south, and Lower Austria on the north side of the Danube. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> is in Upper Austria, which contains several other very considerable towns. The country is very fertile, has a great many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>, and produces vast quantities of sulphur.\n\nIn the ninth and tenth centuries, Austria was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FRONTIER\">frontier</a> of the empire against the barbarians. In 928, the emperor Henry the Fowler, perceiving that it was of great importance to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> in Austria who might oppose these incursions, invested Leopold, named the illustrious, with that country. Otho I. erected Austria into a marquisate in favour of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> Leopold, whose descendant Henry II. was created <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Austria by the emperor Frederic Barbarossa. His posterity becoming extinct in 1240, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of the country, in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> themselves from the incursions of the Bavarians and Hungarians, resolved to put themselves under the protection of Henry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARQUIS\">marquis</a> of M\u00fcnster, but Othochar II., <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a>, being likewise invited by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUCHY\">duchy</a>, took possession of it, alleging not only the invitation of the states, but also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of his wife, heiress of Frederic the last duke. The emperor Rodolphus I., pretending a right to this duchy, refused to give Othochar the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTITURE\">investiture</a> of it; and afterwards killing him in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, procured the right of it to his own family. From this Rodolphus the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of Austria is descended,\nwhich for several centuries past has rendered itself so famous and so powerful, having given 14 emperors to Germany, and five kings to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>.\n\nIn 1477, Austria was erected into an archduchy by the emperor Frederic the Pacific for his son Maximilian, with these privileges: That these shall be judged to have obtained the investiture of the states, if they do not receive it after having demanded it three times; that if they receive it from the emperor, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">imperial</a> ambassadors, they are to be on horseback, clad in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> mantle, having in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a> of command, and upon their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUCAL\">ducal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, and surrounded with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> like that of the imperial crown. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHDUKE\">archduke</a> is born privy-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNSELLOR\">counsellor</a> to the emperor, and his states cannot be put to the ban of the empire. All attempts against his person are punished as crimes of lese-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a>, in the same manner as those against the king of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, or electors. No one dared to challenge him to single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a>. It is in his choice to assist at the assemblies, or to be absent; and he has the privilege of being exempt from contributions and public taxes, excepting 12 soldiers which he is obliged to maintain against the Turks for one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>. He has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> immediately after the electors; and exercises <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> in his states without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of a privilege granted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. His subjects cannot even be summoned out of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of law-suits, to give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a>, or to receive the investiture of fiefs. Any of the lands of the empire may be alienated in his favour, even those that are feudal; and he has a right to create counts, barons, gentlemen, poets, and notaries. In the succession to his states, the right of birth takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>; and, failing males, the females succeed according to the lineal right, and, if no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> be found, they may dispose of their lands as they please.\n\nUpper Austria, properly so called, has throughout the appearance of a happy country. Here are no signs of the striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> betwixt poverty and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> which offends so much in Hungary. All the inhabitants, those of the capital only excepted, enjoy that happy mediocrity which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of a gentle and wise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, who enjoy a kind of lower judicial power, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> defined. The south and south-west parts of the country are bounded by a ridge of hills, the inhabitants of which enjoy a share of prosperity unknown to those of the interior parts of France. There are many villages and market towns, the inhabitants of which have bought themselves off from vassalage, are now their own governors, and belong some of them to the estates of the country. The cloisters, the prelates of which belong to the estates of the country, are the richest in Germany, after the immediate prelacies and abbeys of the empire. One of the greatest convents of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol3.html#article-BENEDICTINES\">Benedictines</a> is worth upwards of 4000 millions of French livres, half of which goes to the exchequer of the country.\n\nLower Austria yearly exports more than two millions guilders worth of wine to Moravia, Bohemia, Upper Austria, Bavaria, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALZBURG\">Salzburg</a>, and part of Styria and Carinthia. This wine is fine, but has a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of strength, and may be carried all over the world without danger; when it is ten or twenty years old it is very good. This country is very well peopled. Mr Schloesser, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">Political</a> Journal, which contains an account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of Austria, estimates that of this country at 2,100,000 men. The revenue amounts to about 14,000,000 florins, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Vienna contributes above five, as one man in the capital earns as much as three in the country.\n\nThe southern parts of Austria are covered with hills, which rise gradually from the banks of the Danube to the borders of Styria, and are covered with woods. They lose themselves in the mists of mountains which run to the south of Germany, and stretch through all Styria, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARNIOLA\">Carniola</a>, Carinthia, and Tyrol, to the Swiss <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a>; and probably, after Savoy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>, the highest part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. The inhabitants of this extensive ridge of mountains are all very much alike; they are a strong, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, and, the Goitres excepted, a very handsome people.\n\nThe characteristic of the inhabitants of all this country is striking bigotry, united with striking sensuality. You need only see what is going forwards here to be convinced that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> taught by the monks is as ruinous to the morals as it is repugnant to Christianity. The Cicibos accompany the married women from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BED\">bed</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> them to the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFESSIONAL\">confessional</a>. The bigotry of the public in the interior parts of Austria, which from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of gallantry with it, is still to be found even amongst people of rank, degenerates amongst the common people into the grossest and most abominable buffoonery. The Windes, who are mixed with the Germans in these countries, distinguish themselves by a superstitious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> that does little honour to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> understanding, and would be incredible if we had not the most unequivocal proofs of the fact before our eyes. Many years ago, they set out in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with some Hungarian enthusiasts to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOGNE\">Cologne</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a>, which is about 120 German miles distant, to cut off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRUCIFIX\">crucifix</a> there. Every seven years this operation is repeated, as in this space of time the beard grows again to its former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>. The rich persons of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> send the poorer ones as their deputies, and the magistrates of Cologne receive them as ambassadors from a foreign prince. They are entertained at the expense of the state, and a counsellor shows them the most remarkable things in the town. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARCE\">farce</a> brings in large sums of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> at stated times, and may therefore deserve political encouragement; but still, however, it is the most miserable and meanest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> that can be imagined.

In 1503, he privately taught eloquence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>; and in 1507 he publicly taught Greek at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRACOW\">Cracow</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a>. In 1509, he read lectures <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> some Cicero's works at Ingolstadt: and in 1512, was appointed to be preceptor to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> and Prince Ernest, sons of Albert the Wise, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Bavaria, and travelled with the latter of these two princes. After this he undertook to write the annals of Bavaria; being encouraged by the dukes of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, who settled a pension upon him, and gave him hopes that they would defray the charges of the book. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, which gained its author <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> reputation, was first published in 1554, by Jerome Zieglerus, professor of poetry in the university of Ingolstadt; and afterwards at Basle in 1580, by Nicholas Cipner. An affront which Aventine received in the year 1529, struck by him all the rest of his life: he was forcibly taken out of his Aventine father's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> at Abenberg, and hurried to jail; the true cause of which violence was never known: but it would probably have been carried to a much greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, had not the duke of Bavaria interfered, and taken this learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> into his protection. Mr Bayle remarks, that the incurable melancholy which from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> possessed Aventine, was so far from determining him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> a life of celibacy, as he had done till he was 64, that it induced him perhaps to think of marrying. The violence of his new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> was not, however, so great, but that it suffered him to advise with two of his friends, and consult certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a> relative to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>. The result was, that it was best for him to marry; and having already lost too much time, considering his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, he took the first woman he met with, who happened to be his own maid, ill-tempered, ugly, and extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>.

The cathedral is a large, gloomy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHIC\">Gothic</a> building, with two spire steeples; it is adorned with paintings upon whimsical subjects, and has a great gate all of brass, over which are several scripture <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> well represented in baso-relief.

The church of St Croix is one of the handsomest in Augsburg for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, painting, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>, gilding, and a fine spire.\n\nThe inhabitants look upon Augustus Caesar as the founder of the town: it is true, that that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> sent a colony there; but the town was already founded, though he gave it the name of Augusta Vindelicorum. Augsburg, indeed, is one of the oldest towns in Germany, and one of the most remarkable of them, as it is there and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUREMBERG\">Nuremberg</a> that you meet with the oldest marks of German art and industry. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> of this town was the most extensive of any part of south Germany, and contributed much to the civilization of the country by the works of art and variety of necessaries to the comfort and convenience of life which it was the means of introducing. Many things originated in this town which have had a great influence on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of mankind. Not to mention the many important diets of the empire held here; here, in 952, did a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> confirm the order for the celibacy of priests; here, in 1530, was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFESSION\">confession</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> of the Protestants laid before the emperor and other estates of Germany; and here, in 1555, was signed the famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> of peace, by which religious liberty was secured to Germany.\n\nThough the Protestants were very powerful at Augsburg, they could not keep their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>: for the Bavarians drove them from thence: but Gustavus Adolphus restored them again in 1632; since which time they have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> there, and share the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> with the Catholics. In 1703, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELECTOR\">elector</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BAVARIA\">Bavaria</a> took the city after a siege of seven days, and demolished the fortifications: however the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Hochstedt restored their liberty, which they yet enjoy under the government of their own magistrates, the bishop having no temporal dominion in the city. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> is composed of persons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, who are to bring proofs of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>. The canons have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of electing their own bishop, who is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a>, in the same manner as several of the German bishops.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> is very good: and though the town has no territory, it has no debts. Augsburg is, however, no longer what it was. It no longer has a Fugger and a Welser in it to lend the emperor millions. In this large and handsome town, formerly one of the greatest trading towns in Germany, there are no merchants at present to be found who have capitals of more than 20,000l. The others, most of whom must have their coaches, go creeping on with capitals of 300l. or 400l. and do the business of brokers and commissioners. Some houses, however, carry on a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANKING\">banking</a> trade; and the way through Tyrol and Graubunden occasions some little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> between this place and Germany. After these brokers and doers of business by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>, the engravers, statuaries, and painters, are the most reputable of the labouring part of the city. Their productions, like the toys of Nuremberg, go everywhere. There are always some people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> amongst them; but the small demand for their art affords them so little encouragement, that to prevent starving they are mostly confined to the small religious works which are done elsewhere by Capuchin monks. They furnish all Germany with little pictures for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a> books, and to hang in the citizens' houses. There is an academy of arts instituted here under the protection of the magistrates: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> aim of which is to produce good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, and preserve the manufactures of the city.\nThis town, which is 9\u00bd miles in circumference, contains, according to Mr. Riebeck, hardly 30,000 inhabitants; but Mr Nicolai makes them about 35,000.\n\nThis city has its drinking water from the river Lech, which runs at some distance from it; and the aqueducts which convey the water are much to be admired. As the court of Bavaria has it in its power to cut off this indispensable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, by threatening the town with doing so, it often lays it under contribution. But as it has, besides this, other means of keeping the high council in a state of dependence, to secure itself from this oppression, the city seeks the emperor's protection, upon whom it makes itself as dependent on the other side, so as to be indeed only a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> which both courts play with. The emperor's minister to the circle of Swabia generally resides here, and by so doing secures to his court a perpetual influence. There are always Austrian and Prussian recruiting parties quartered here, and the partiality of the government to the former is very remarkable. In the war of 1756, the citizens were divided into equal parties for the two courts. The Catholics considered the emperor as their god, and the Protestants did the same by the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> had almost kindled a bloody civil war amongst them.\u2014The bishop takes his name from this town, but resides at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol8.html#article-DILLINGEN\">Dillingen</a>. He has an income of about 20,000l. per annum. As a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the catholicism of this place, the Pope throughout his whole progress met nowhere with such honours as he did here. This he owed to his friends the Jesuits, who have still great influence. E. Long. 10. 58. N. Lat. 48\u00b0 24'.\n\nAugsburg Confession, denotes a celebrated confession of faith drawn up by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a> and Melanchthon, on behalf of themselves and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> reformers, and presented in 1530 to the emperor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. at the diet of Augsburg or Augsburg, in the name of the evangelic body. This confession contains 28 chapters; of which the greatest part is employed in representing, with perspicuity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, the religious opinions of the Protestants, and the rest in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> out the errors and abuses that occasioned their separation from the church of Rome.\n\nAugur, an officer among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> appointed to foretell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> events, by the chattering, flight, and feeding of birds. There was a college or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> of them, consisting originally of three members with respect to the three tribes, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LUCERES\">Luceres</a>, Ramnenses, and Titites; afterwards the number was increased to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a>, four of whom were patricians and five plebeians. They bore an augural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a> or wand, as the ensign of their authority; and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> was so much respected, that they were never deposed, or any substituted in their place, though they should be convicted of the most enormous crimes. See Augury.\n\nAugural, something relating to the augurs.\u2014The augural instruments are represented on several ancient medals.\n\nAugural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPPER\">Supper</a>, that given by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> on his first admission into the order, called also by Varro Adjectalis.\n\nAugural Books, those wherein the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> and rules of augury were laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>.\n\nAugurale, the place in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a> where the general took auspicia. This answered to the Augurato, Augurale rium in the city.\n\nAugurale is also used in Seneca for the ensign or badge of an augur, as the latus.\n\nAuguratorium, a building on the Palatine mount, where public auguries were taken.\n\nAugury, in its proper sense, the art of foretelling future events by observations taken from the chattering, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SINGING\">singing</a>, feeding, and flight, of birds; though it is used by some writers in a more general signification, as comprising all the different kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVINATION\">divination</a>.\n\nAugury was a very ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>. We know from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HESIOD\">Hesiod</a>, that husbandry was in part regulated by the coming or going of birds: and most probably it had been in use long before his time, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a> was then in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time, these animals seem to have gained a greater and very wonderful authority, till at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> no affair of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, either of private or public concern, was undertaken without consulting them. They were looked upon as the interpreters of the gods; and those who were qualified to understand their oracles were held among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> men in the Greek and Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, and became the advisers of kings, and even of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> himself. However absurd such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> as a college of augurs may appear in our eyes, yet, like all other extravagant institutions, it had in part its origin from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. When men considered the wonderful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MIGRATION\">migration</a> of birds, how they disappeared at once, and appeared again at stated times, and could give no guess where they went, it was almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to suppose, that they retired somewhither out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and perhaps approached the ethereal regions, where they might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> with the gods, and thence be enabled to predict events. It was almost natural for a superstitious people to imagine this; at least to believe it, as soon as some impostor was impudent enough to affect it. Add to this, that the disposition in some birds to imitate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, must contribute much to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of such a doctrine. This institution of augury seems to have been much more ancient than that of auspicy; for we find many instances of the former in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>, but not a single one of the latter, though frequent mention is made of sacrifices in that author. From the whole of what has been observed, it seems probable that natural augury gave rise to religious augury, and this to auspicy, as the mind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> makes a very easy transition from a little truth to a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>.\n\nA passage in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOPHANES\">Aristophanes</a> gave the hint for these observations. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMEDY\">comedy</a> of the Birds, he makes one of them say this: 'The greatest blessings which can happen to you, mortals, are derived from us; first we show you the seasons, viz. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, winter, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRANE\">crane</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out the time for sowing, when she flies with her warning notes into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>; she bids the sailor hang up his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RUDDER\">rudder</a> and take his raft, and every prudent man provide himself with winter garments. Next the kite appearing, proclaims another season, viz. when it is time to shear his sheep. After that the swallow informs you when it is time to put on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> clothes. We are to you, (adds the chorus), <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMMON\">Ammon</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DODONA\">Dodona</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a>: for, after consulting us, you undertake every thing; merchandise, purchases, marriages,\nAugust marriages, &c. Now, it seems not improbable, that the same transition was made in the speculations of men which appears in the poet's words; and that they were easily induced to think, that the surprising foresight of birds, as to the time of migration, indicated something of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> nature in them; which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>, as an Epicurean, thinks fit to enter his protest against, when he says,\n\nHaud equidem credo, quia sit divinitas illis ingenium.\n\nBut to return to Aristophanes. The first part of the chorus, from whence the fore-cited passage is taken, seems, with all its wildness, to contain the fabulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANT\">cant</a>, which the augurs made use of in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> for their impudent impositions on mankind. It sets out with a cosmogony; and says, That in the beginning were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAOS\">Chaos</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">Night</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EREBUS\">Erebus</a> and Tartarus: That there was neither water, nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, nor sky: That Night laid an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>, from whence, after a time, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOVE\">Love</a> arose: That Love, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> with Erebus, produced a third kind; and that they were the first of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, &c.\n\nAugustus, (augustus), in a general sense, something majestic, venerable, or sacred. The appellation was first conferred by the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> upon Octavius, after his being confirmed by them in the sovereign power. It was conceived as expressing something divine, or elevated above the pitch of mankind, being derived from the verb augo, \"I increase,\" tanquam supra humanam formam auctus. See Augustus.\n\nAugust, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">Chronology</a>, the eighth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of our year, containing 31 days. August was dedicated to the honour of Augustus Caesar, because, in the same month, he was created <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a>, thrice triumphed in Rome, subdued Egypt to the Roman empire, and made an end of civil wars, being before called Sextilis, or the sixth month from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>.\n\nAugusta, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AOSTA\">Aosta</a>, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> in the Adriatic sea on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DALMATIA\">Dalmatia</a>, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAGUSA\">Ragusa</a>, subject to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>.

See Georgia.\n\nAugusta Aeglorum, a town of Aquitania, so named out of compliment to Augustus, being originally called Climentum, which name it afterwards retained. In the middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, it took the name of the people, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUSI\">Ausi</a>; and is now called Auch, the capital of Gascony.\n\nAugusta Emerita, a town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUSITANIA\">Lusitania</a> on the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANAS\">Anas</a>, the capital of the province; a colony of the Emeriti, or such soldiers as had served out their legal time, were men of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, or had received marks of favour. The colony was founded by Augustus; and is now called Merida, a city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, in Extremadura, on the river Guadiana. See Merida.\n\nAugusta Praetoria, a town and colony of Gallia Cisalpina, and capital of the Salassi; seated at the foot of the Alpes Graiae, on the Duria.

See Augsburg Confession.\n\nAugustin, or Austin, St., the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTERBURY\">Canterbury</a>, was originally a monk in the convent of St Andrew at Rome, and educated under St Gregory, afterwards Pope Gregory I. by whom he was despatched into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> with forty other monks of the same order, about the year 596, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the English Saxons to Christianity. They landed in the isle of Thanet; and having sent some French interpreters to King Ethelbert with an account of their errand, the king gave them leave to convert as many of his subjects as they could, and assigned their place of residence, at Dorovernum, since called Canterbury; to which they were confined till the king himself was converted, whose example had a powerful influence in promoting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSION\">conversion</a> of his subjects; but though he was extremely pleased at their becoming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, he never attempted to compel them. He despatched a priest and a monk to Rome, to acquaint the pope with the success of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MISSION\">mission</a>, and to desire his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of certain questions. These men brought back with them a pall, and several books, vestments, utensils, and ornaments for the churches. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a>, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> messengers,\nAugustine messengers, gave Augustine directions concerning the settling of episcopal sees in Britain; and ordered him not to pull down the idol-temples, but to convert them into Christian churches; only destroying the idols, and sprinkling the place with holy water, that the natives, by frequenting the temples they had been always accustomed to, might be the less flocked at their entrance into Christianity. Augustine resided principally at Canterbury, which thus became the metropolitan church of England; and having established bishops in several of the cities, he died on the 26th May, 607. The Popish writers ascribe several miracles to him. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of the festival of St Augustine was first enjoined in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYNOD\">synod</a> held under Cuthbert archbishop of Canterbury, and afterwards by the pope's bull in the reign of King Edward III.\n\nAugustine, Sr., an illustrious father of the church, was born at Thagaste, a city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMIDIA\">Numidia</a>, on the 13th of November 354. His father, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BURGESS\">burgess</a> of that city, was called Patricius; and his mother, Monica, who being a woman of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, instructed him in the principles of the Christian religion. In his early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a> he was in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of the catechumens; and falling dangerously ill, earnestly desired to be baptized; but the violence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTEMPER\">distemper</a> ceasing, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a> was delayed. His father, who was not yet baptized, made him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> at Thagaste, Madaura, and afterwards at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a>. Augustine having read Cicero's books of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, began to entertain a love for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, and applied himself to the study of the Holy Scriptures; nevertheless, he suffered himself to be seduced by the Manicheans. At the age of 19, he returned to Thagaste, and taught grammar, and also frequented the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>; he afterwards taught <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a> at Carthage with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a>. The insolence of the scholars at Carthage made him take a resolution to go to Rome, though against his mother's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>. Here also he had many scholars; but disliking them, he quitted Rome, and settled at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a>, and was chosen public professor of rhetoric in that city. Here he had opportunities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> the sermons of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBROSE\">Ambrose</a>, which, together with the study of St Paul's epistles, and the conversion of two of his friends, determined him to retract his errors, and quit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> of the Manicheans; this was in the 32nd year of his age. In the vacation of the year 386, he retired to the house of a friend of his, named Persecundus, where he seriously applied himself to the study of the Christian religion, in order to prepare himself for baptism, which he received at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EASTER\">Easter</a> in the year 387. Soon after this, his mother came to see him at Milan, and invite him back to Carthage; but at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OSTIA\">Ostia</a>, whither he went to embark in order to his return, she died. He arrived in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a> about the end of the year 388; and having obtained a garden-plot without the walls of the city of Hippo, he associated himself with 11 other persons of eminent sanctity, who distinguished themselves by wearing leathern girdles, and lived there in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONASTIC\">monastic</a> way for the space of three years, exercising themselves in fasting, prayer, study, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITATION\">meditation</a>, day and night: from hence sprung up the Augustinian friars, or eremitae of St Augustine, being the first order of mendicants; those of St Jerome, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARMELITES\">Carmelites</a>, and others, being but branches of this of St Augustine. About this time, or before, Valerius bishop of Hippo, against his will, ordained him priest; nevertheless, he continued to reside in his little Augustinian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONASTERY\">monastery</a>, with his brethren, who, renouncing all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, possessed their goods in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>. Valerius, who had appointed St Augustine to preach in his place, allowed him to do it in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a>, contrary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of the churches in Africa. He explained the creed, in a general council of Africa, held in 393. Two years after, Valerius, fearing he might be preferred to be bishop of another church, appointed him his coadjutor or colleague, and caused him to be ordained bishop of Hippo, by Megalus bishop of Calame, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMATE\">primate</a> of Numidia. St Augustine died the 28th day of August, 430, aged 76 years, having had the misfortune to see his country invaded by the Vandals, and the city where he was bishop besieged for seven months.\n\nThe works of St Augustine make ten volumes: the best edition of them is that of Maurin, printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTWERP\">Antwerp</a>, in 1700. They are but little read at this time, except by the clergy of the Greek church and in the Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a>. The bookellers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> receive frequent commissions for them, and indeed for the most of the fathers, from Russia, and also from Spain.\n\nAugustine, Sr., a fort of North America, on the east coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLORIDA\">Florida</a>, situated in W. Long. 81\u00b0 10'. N. Lat. 30\u00b0 0'. This fort was built by the Spaniards; who were scarce well established there when they were attacked by Sir Francis Drake in 1586, who reduced and pillaged the fort and town adjacent. In 1665, it underwent a similar fate, being attacked by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Davis at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of buccaneers. In 1702 an attempt was made by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> More to annex St Augustine to the British dominions. He invested it with only 500 English and 700 Indians; which small force, however, would have been sufficient to reduce the place, had not succours arrived when it was on the point of surrendering. Even then, it is thought that he might have defeated the reinforcement which arrived; but he chose to raise the siege, and retire with precipitation. In 1740, another unsuccessful attempt was made on this fort by General Oglethorpe: it was, however, together with the whole country of Florida, ceded to Great Britain by the treaty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> in 1763; but has since been restored to Spain by the treaty of peace 1783.\n\nAugustine, a cape of South America. W. Long. 35\u00b0 4'. S. Lat. 8\u00b0 30'.\n\nAugustins, or Augustinians, an order of religious; thus called from St Augustine, whose rule they observe. The Augustins, popularly also called Auffin friars, were originally hermits, whom Pope Alexander IV. first congregated into one body, under their general Lanfranc, in 1256. Soon after their institution, this order was brought into England, where they had about thirty-two houses at the time of their suppression.\n\nThe Augustins are clothed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, and make one of the four orders of mendicants. From these arose a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a>, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a> of bare-foot Augustins, or Minorites, or Friars minor.\n\nThere are also canons <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> of St Augustine, who are clothed in white, excepting their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPE\">cope</a>, which is black. At Paris they were known under the denomination of religious of Genevieve; that abbey was the chief of\nof the order. There are also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol16.html#article-NUNS\">nuns</a> and canons, who observe the rules of St Augustin.\n\nAugustinians are also those divines who maintain, on the authority of St Augustin, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> is effectual from its nature, absolutely and morally, and not relatively and gradually. They are divided into rigid and relaxed.\n\nAugustobona, a city of the Tricassiers in ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a>, from whom it was afterwards called Tricasses, and Treccasse; and still farther corrupted to Throare, or Treci; whence the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> name <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-TROYES\">Troyes</a>, in Champagne, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEINE\">Seine</a>. See Troyes.\n\nAugustodunum, the capital of the Aedui, where there was a famous academy or school for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> of youth; now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUN\">Autun</a>, or Autun, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUCHY\">duchy</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BURGUNDY\">Burgundy</a>, on the Arroux. See Autun.\n\nAugustomagus, an ancient town of Gallia Belgica; now Sentin, in the Isle of France. E. Long. 2\u00b0 30'. N. Lat. 49\u00b0 10'.\n\nAugustoritum, in Ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a>, according to some authors the capital of the Pictones, afterwards called Picavi; now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POITIERS\">Poitiers</a>. But by Antonine's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITINERARY\">Itinerary</a> from Burdigala to Argantomagus (or Argenton, as it is interpreted by many), it can be no other but the capital of the Lemovices, now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LIMOGES\">Limoges</a>, situated between Velluna of the Petrocorii, or Perigeux, and Argantomagus. E. Long. 1\u00b0 22'. Lat. 45\u00b0 52'.\n\nAugustow, a small but strong town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a>, in the duchy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALATINATE\">palatinate</a> of Polakia, seated on the river Narie. E. Long. 24\u00b0 2'. N. Lat. 53\u00b0 25'.\n\nAugustus, Fort, a small fortress seated on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> at the head of Lochness in Scotland, between the rivers Taarf and Oich; the last is a considerable stream, and has over it a stone <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> of three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>. The fort consists of four battions: within is the governor's house, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARRACKS\">barracks</a> for 400 men; it was taken by the rebels in 1746, who immediately deserted it after demolishing what they could. The name of this fort in Erse is Kill Chumain, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BURIAL\">burial</a> place of the Cummins. It lies on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to the isle of Sky, which is about 52 miles off; but on the whole way there is not a place fit for the reception of man or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>.\n\nAugustus, the appellation conferred upon Caesar Octavianus, the first Roman emperor. See Octavianus and Rome.\n\nThe obscure name of Octavianus, Mr Gibbon observes, he derived from a mean family, in the little town of Aricia. It was stained with the blood of the proscription; and he was desirous, had it been possible, to erase all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of his former life. The illustrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SURNAME\">surname</a> of C\u00e6sar he had assumed, as the adopted son of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DICTATOR\">dictator</a>; but he had too much good sense either to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> to be confounded, or to wish to be compared, with that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> man. It was proposed in the senate, to dignify their minister with a new appellation; and after a very serious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a>, that of Augustus was chosen among several others, as being the most expressive of the character of peace and sanctity, which he uniformly affected. Augustus was therefore a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a>, C\u00e6sara family, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>. The former should naturally have expired with the prince on whom it was bestowed; and however the latter was diffused by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a>, Nero was the last prince who could allege any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> claims to the honour of the Julian line. But at the time of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, the practice of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> had inseparably connected those appellations with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">imperial</a> dignity, and they have been preserved by a long succession of emperors, Romans, Greeks, Franks, and Germans, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of the republic to the present time. A distinction was, however, soon introduced. The sacred title of Augustus was always reserved for the monarch; the name of C\u00e6sar was more freely communicated to his relations; and from the reign of Hadrian at least, was appropriated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> in the state, who was considered as the presumptive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> of the empire.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AVIARY\">Aviary</a>, a place set apart for feeding and propagating birds. It should be so large as to give the birds some freedom of flight; and turfed, to avoid the appearance of foulness on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AVICENNA\">Avicenna</a>, or Avicen, the prince of Arabian philosophers and physicians, was born at Afifna, a village in the neighbourhood of Bokhara. His father was from Balkh in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, and had married at Bokhara. The first years of Avicenna were devoted to the study of the Koran and the belles lettres. He soon showed what he was likely to become afterwards; and the progress he made was so rapid, that when he was but ten years old, he was perfectly intelligent in the most hidden tenets of the Koran.\n\nAbou-Abdallah, a native of Napoous in Syria, at that time professed philosophy at Bokhara with the greatest reputation. Avicenna studied under him the principles of logic; but soon, disgusted with the slow manner of the schools, he set about studying alone, and read all the authors that had written on philosophy, without any other help than that of their commentators. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">Mathematics</a> had no fewer charms for him; and after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> the first five propositions of Euclid, he got alone to the last, having made himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of them, and treasured up all of them equally in his memory.\n\nPossessed with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> avidity to be acquainted with all sorts of sciences, he likewise devoted himself to the study of medicine. Persuaded that this divine art consisted as much in practice as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, he sought all opportunities of seeing the sick; and afterwards confessed, that he had learned more from experience than from all the old books he had read. He was now in his 16th year, and already was celebrated for being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of his age. He resolved at this age to resume his studies of philosophy, which medicine had made him neglect; and he spent a year and a half in this painful labour, without ever sleeping all this time a whole night together. If he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> himself oppressed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, or exhausted by study, a glass of wine refreshed his wasted spirits, and gave him new vigour for study; if in spite of him his eyes, for a few minutes shut out the light, it then happened to him to recollect and meditate upon all the things that had occupied his thoughts before sleep. At the age of 21, he conceived the bold design of incorporating, in one work, all the objects of human knowledge; and carried it into execution in an Encyclopaedia of 20 volumes, to which he gave the title of the Utility of Utilities.\n\nSeveral great princes had been taken dangerously ill, and Avicenna was the only one that could know their ailments.\nAvicenna, ailments and cure them. His reputation increased daily, and all the kings of Asia desired to retain him in their families.\n\nMahmud, the son of Sabektekin, the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SULTAN\">sultan</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYNASTY\">dynasty</a> of the Samanides, was then the most powerful prince of the east. Imagining that an implicit obedience should be paid by all manner of persons to the injunctions of his will, he wrote a haughty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Mamun sultan of Kharazm, ordering him to send Avicenna to him, who was at his court, with several other learned men. Philosophy, the friend of liberty and independence, looks down with scorn on the shackles of compulsion and restraint. Avicenna, accustomed to the most flattering distinctions among the great, could not endure the imperious manner of Mahmud's inviting him to his court, and refused to go there. But the sultan of Kharazm, who dreaded his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a>, obliged the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> to depart with others whom that prince had demanded to be sent to him.\n\nAvicenna pretended to obey; but instead of repairing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAZNA\">Gazna</a>, he took the route of Giorgian. Mahmud, who had gloried in the thoughts of keeping him at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, was greatly irritated at his flight. He dispatched portraits done in crayons of this philosopher to all the princes of Asia, with orders to have him conducted to Gazna, if he appeared in their courts. But Avicenna had fortunately escaped the most diligent search after him. He arrived in the capital of Giorgian, where under a disguised name he performed many admirable cures.\n\nCabous then reigned in that country. A nephew, whom he was extremely fond of, being fallen sick, the most able physicians were called in, and none of them were able to know his ailment, or give him any ease. Avicenna was at last consulted. So soon as he had felt the young prince's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a>, he was confident with himself, that his illness proceeded from a violent love, which he dared not to declare. Avicenna commanded the person who had the care of the different apartments in the palace, to name them all in their respective order. A more lively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> in the prince's pulse, at hearing mentioned one of these apartments, betrayed a part of his secret. The keeper then had orders to name all the slaves that inhabited that apartment. At the name of one of those beauties, the young Cabous could not contain himself; an extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> of his pulse completed the discovery of what he in vain desired to keep concealed. Avicenna, now fully assured that this slave was the cause of the prince's illness, declared, that she alone had the power to cure him.\n\nThe sultan's consent was necessary, and he of course was curious to see his nephew's physician. He had scarce looked at him, when he knew in his features those of the crayoned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> sent him by Mahmud; but Cabous, far from forcing Avicenna to repair to Gazna, retained him for some time with him, and heaped honours and presents on him.\n\nThis philosopher passed afterwards into the court of Nedjmeddevle, sultan of the race of the Bouides. Being appointed first physician to that prince, he found means to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> his confidence to so great a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, that he raised him to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a> of grand vizir. But he did not long enjoy that illustrious dignity. Too great an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to pleasures, especially those of love and Avicenna, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, made him lose at the same time his post and his master's favour. From that time Avicenna felt all the rigours of adversity, which he had brought upon himself by his ill conduct. He wandered about as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUGITIVE\">fugitive</a>, and was often obliged to shift the place of his habitation to secure his life from danger. He died at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAMADAN\">Hamadan</a>, aged 58 years, in the 428th year of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEGIRA\">Hegira</a>, and of Christ 1036.\n\nThe perfect knowledge he had of physic did not secure him from the ailments that afflict human nature. He was attacked by several maladies in the course of his life, and particularly was very subject to the colic. His excesses in pleasures, and his infirmities, made a poet say who wrote his epitaph, that the profound study of philosophy had not taught him good morals, nor that of medicine the art of preserving his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>.\n\nNo one composed with greater facility than Avicenna, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, when he sat down to it, 50 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a> generally in a day, without fatiguing himself. The doctors of Schiras, having made a collection of objections against one of his metaphysical works, sent it to him at Ifpanah by Cafem. This learned man, not arriving till towards evening, came to Avicenna's house, with whom he sat discoursing till midnight. When Cafem had retired, he wrote an answer to the objections of the Schirazians, and finished it before sunrise. He immediately delivered it to Cafem, telling him, that he had made all possible despatch in order not to detain him any longer at Ifpanah.\n\nAvicenna, after his death, enjoyed so great a reputation, that till the 12th century he was preferred for the study of philosophy and medicine to all his predecessors. His works were the only writings in vogue in schools, even in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. The following are the titles:\n\n1. Of the Utility and Advantage of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">Science</a>, twenty books.\n2. Of Innocence and Criminality, two books.\n3. Of Health and Remedies, eighteen books.\n4. Canons of Physic, fourteen books.\n5. On Astronomical Observations, one book.\n6. On Mathematical Sciences.\n7. Of Theorems, or Mathematical and Theological Demonstrations, one Book.\n8. On the Arabic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">Language</a>, and its Properties, ten books.\n9. On the Last Judgment.\n10. On the Origin of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">Soul</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESURRECTION\">Resurrection</a> of Bodies.\n11. Of the end we should propose to ourselves in Harangues and Philosophical Argumentations.\n12. Demoustration of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLATERAL\">collateral</a> Lines in the Sphere.\n13. Abridgement of Euclid.\n14. On Infinity and Infinity.\n15. On Physics and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">Metaphysics</a>.\n16. On Animals and Vegetables, &c.\n17.

This man had acquired so much honour and wealth, that he was solicited by many to take their sons to be his scholars, or even his servants; but being resolved not to discover the secrets of his art, he would receive none of them. Avicenna's mother formed the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STRATAGEM\">stratagem</a>: she offered him her son as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a>, pretending he was naturally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAF_AND_DUMB\">deaf and dumb</a>; and the youth by his mother's instructions, counterfeited those defects so well, that the physician, after making several trials to discover the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> of them, took the boy into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, and by degrees trusted him.\nAvicen him so far as to leave his writings open in his room when he went abroad: Avicenes took that opportunity to transcribe them, and carried the copies to his mother; and after death of his master he published them under his own name. Indeed if we reflect that he lived but 58 years, that he was a wanderer and a fugitive, and that he was much addicted to his pleasures, we shall have some difficulty to conceive how he could find time to compose so many works. Physic, however, is indebted to him for the discovery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CASSIS\">cassis</a>, rhubarb, mirabolans, tamarinds; and from him also, it is said, came to us the art of making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>.","sp":319,"ep":326},{"h":"AVICENIA","t":"Eastern Anacardium.

It was formerly an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a>'s see; and the residence of several popes at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> for 70 years has rendered it considerable. Near the Rhone there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> rock, within the circumference of the walls, upon which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PLATFORM\">platform</a>, from whence may be had a prospect of the whole city and the places about it. This city is about three miles and two furlongs in circumference, and is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> ill built, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>, and devoid of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>. But it is surrounded by handsome battlemented walls and turrets, not unlike those of Rome; and its public edifices are large, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> of the fourteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> could make them. Several popes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTI\">anti</a>-popes, who, during their lives, shook the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> with violence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol1.html#article-ALTERCATION\">altercation</a>, repose quietly near each other in the various monasteries of the place. The church of the Cordeliers contains, in an obscure corner, the almost defaced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a> of Petrarch's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAURA\">Laura</a> and her husband Hugh de Sade; and nearly opposite is the tomb of the brave Gullon, so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> known for his invincible courage as well as for his inviolable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> Henry IV. Many productions of Rene of Anjou are to be seen in the city; whose inhabitants amount to about 30,000, of whom 1000 are ecclesiastics and some hundreds Jews. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of the vice-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGATE\">legate</a> is composed of several large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> towers, and he gives audience in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> which is full of fine paintings, as is also the chapel and the apartments. The arsenal is near the palace.\n\nThe church of Notre Dame is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a>, but not large, and is one of the best adorned in the city. After having ascended about 50 steps, you come to a very ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PORTICO\">portico</a>, which sustains a great tower; as you enter the church on the left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, you see paintings which equal the finest in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>. The great altar is very magnificent, and is adorned with a shrine that contains the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELICS\">relics</a> of whom we know not how many saints. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> of the sacristy is worthy of the curiosity of the traveller. The little palace where the archbishop resides is formed of three bodies of lodgings, accompanied with courts and small pavilions. It overlooks the Rhone, the city, and the fields. These buildings and the mint adorn a large square, which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> walk of the inhabitants.\n\nIn Avignon they reckon seven gates, seven palaces, seven colleges, seven hospitals, seven monasteries, seven nunneries, and seven popes who have lived there in 70 years. The steeples are numerous, and the bells are never at rest; one of silver is rung only on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of a pope. The church of the Celestines is very magnificent, and full of fine monuments, and the rest are not without their curiosities. The university has four colleges; and the place where the Jews live is a distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, from whence the Jews who pay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUTE\">tribute</a> dare not stir out without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> hats, and the women must have something yellow about their heads, to distinguish them from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> is very considerable in a very confined place, where the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of enlarging their abodes is by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> their houses higher. Their synagogue is so dark, that they are obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> lamps. However, they are forced to hear a monk preach a sermon every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>. Across the Rhone, here, extend the ruined and decayed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> against which Madame de Grignan was so near being loit, and of which Madame de Sevigne makes terrified mention. It was demolished in 1699 by one of the inundations common to the Rhone. When entire, it was not less than a quarter of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>; but being so narrow as not to permit two carriages to pass in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a>, it had previously become almost useless; and motives of policy prevent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of a new bridge, while Avignon belongs to the papal see. The curious that travel this way go to see the fountain of Vaucluse, where the river Sorgues, which passes through this city, has its source; and whither Petrarch so often retired to indulge his grief and hopeless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>. It is situated in a valley five miles distant from the city. The sides of the river are skirted by meadows of the most lively green; above which rise abrupt and lofty rocks, that seem designed to exclude it from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> view. The valley becomes gradually narrower toward the extremity, and winding continually describes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>-hoe. The view is at length terminated by an enormous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of rock, forming a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> across it, of a prodigious height, and absolutely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a>. Through its vast recesses run the streams which supply the fountain of Vaucluse, and at its feet appears a basin of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, several hundred feet in circumference, stretched like an expanse, silent and quiet. The sides are very steep, and it is said that in the middle no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> can be discovered, though attempts have been often made for that purpose; a circumstance probably resulting from the violence with which the springs bubble up, which prevents any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> from descending beyond a certain depth. Though the fountain is clearer in itself than crystal, yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> rock casts a continual shade, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, over its surface. The water escaping from this state of inaction by a narrow passage, is immediately precipitated in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASCADE\">cascade</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> a rocky channel, where it foams over a number of vast detached <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, which intercept and impede its progress. They are covered with a deep green moss of many ages, and have probably tumbled from the mountain that overhangs the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a>. The rocks themselves, which surround and invest this romantic\nAvignon, a mantic spot, are worn by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> and the inclemency of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> into a thousand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> and fantastic forms, to which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> gives shape and figure.\n\nOn one of the pointed extremities, and in a situation which appears almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INACCESSIBLE\">inaccessible</a>, are seen the remains of an ancient castle, projecting over the water. The peasants <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> it \"Il Castello di Petrarcha\"; and add, with great simplicity, that Laura lived upon the opposite side of the river, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of which was a subterranean passage by which the two lovers visited each other. Nothing is however more certain, than that these are the ruins of the chateau belonging to the lords <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> seigneurs of Avignon; and the bishop of Cavaillon resided in it during the frequent visits which he used to make to Petrarch.\u2014The poet's dwelling was much lower down, and nearer to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of the Sorgue, as evidently appears from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of it, and the relation he gives of his quarrel with the Naiads of the stream, who encroached during the winter on his little adjoining territory. No remains of it are now to be discerned. Below the bridge there is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> where the Sorgues joins the Rhone, in which are several houses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>.

In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> times we find Ayr to have been a town of considerable trade. The merchants imported a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of wine from France, and exported corn and other produce of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. The rising trade of Glasgow proved very injurious to the trade of this town; but of late it has much revived. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> shore is flat and shallow, and the entrance of the river Ayr, which forms the harbour, is subject to the inconvenience of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, which is often thrown quite across the river, especially with a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west wind. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> never rises above twelve feet; but from some improvements and extensive works now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> on on the sides of the river, it is hoped the channel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be considerably deepened. There are erected two reflecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>-houses to conduct vessels safely into the harbour. There is great plenty of salmon in the two rivers, the fishings of which rent at upwards of \u00a3200. Besides the salmon fishery, the sand banks on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> abound with all kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> fish; and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> two companies are established here for curing them. The principal trade carried on is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a> of coal to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, in which nearly 2000 tonnage of vessels are annually employed. There is an extensive manufacture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>. Ayr was in ancient times, however, not only distinguished for trade, but also for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> strength. Here the heroic exploits of Sir William Wallace began, and here Edward I. fixed one of his most powerful garrisons. Oliver Cromwell, too, judging it a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> to build a fortress, took possession of the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, and converted it and the neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITADEL\">citadel</a>. On one of the mounts, within the walls of this fortress, stood the old castle of Ayr, mentioned in ancient histories, and the old church, the tower of which still remains, noted for the meeting of the Scottish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, when Robert Bruce's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> to the throne was unanimously confirmed. Ayr is a very gay and fashionable place, it has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> attended races, and is sometimes the seat of the Caledonian hunt. In 1797, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> amounted to 4647; in 1801, 5560.

The establishment of the Douglas and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HERON\">Heron</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">Bank</a>, though ruinous to the proprietors, contributed greatly to promote the improvement of Ayrshire. The abundance of wealth which it fallaciously seemed to pour into the country, and the ready command of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> it gave, set all the proprietors towards improving and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTING\">planting</a> their estates, furnished means for raising and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> lime for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a>, and above all, with the money from the bank, canals and roads were opened through every part of the county.

After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> distress, consequent on so disastrous a scheme, was somewhat relieved, the improvement which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a> had received during the profusion of money, enabled the proprietors to continue the improvement, and the new settlers being mostly men of great fortune, allowed no expense to be wanting to produce the same end; and hence the improvement of the country was rather promoted than retarded, by an event which threatened to overwhelm not only Ayrshire, but the greater part of Scotland, into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> of bankruptcy. Ayrshire, besides the inexhaustible seams of coal with which it abounds, possesses several other valuable minerals; as freestone, limestone, ironstone, several rich ores of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>. A few curious specimens are also to be found in the hills of Carrick, of agates, porphyries, and of calcareous petrifactions. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of Stair, galena and plumbago have been found; and in several parts of the county is found that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of whetstone, known by the name of Ayr-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>.

But since a blue has been extracted from cobalt, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> has applied to it the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of azure, although it differs considerably from the former, and is incapable of being used for the same purposes, and particularly for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>. The former at present is called lapis lazuli, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> only lapis; and the blue prepared from it for painting in oil, is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ULTRAMARINE\">ultramarine</a>.\u2014The name azure is generally applied to the blue glass made from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> of cobalt and vitrifiable matters. This glass, which is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMALT\">smalt</a> when in masses, is called azure only when it is reduced to a fine powder. Several kinds of azure are distinguished, according to its degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, by the names of fine azure, powdered azure, and azure of four fires. In general, the more intense the colour, and the finer the powder, the more beautiful and dear it is. Azure is employed to colour <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STARCH\">starch</a>; hence it has also been called starch blue. It is used for painting with colours, and for a blue enamel.\n\nAzure, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HERALDRY\">Heraldry</a>, the blue colour in the arms of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> below the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARON\">baron</a>.

But, by whomsoever it was founded, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol16.html#article-NEBUCHADNEZZAR\">Nebuchadnezzar</a> was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who put the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> to it, and made it one of the wonders of the world. The most famous works in and about it were the walls of the city, the temple of Belus, Nebuchadnezzar's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, the hanging-gardens, the banks of the river, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> lake, and canals.\n\nThe city was surrounded with walls, in thickness 87 feet, in height 350 feet; and in compass 480 furlongs or 60 of our miles. Thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a>, who was himself at Babylon; and though some disagree with him in these dimensions, yet most writers give us the same, or nearly the same, as he does. Diodorus Siculus diminishes the circumference of these walls very considerably, and takes somewhat from the height of them, as in Herodotus; though he seems to add to their breadth by saying, that six chariots might drive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABREAST\">abreast</a> thereon: while the former writes, that one chariot only might turn upon them; but then he places buildings <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> each side of the top of these walls, which, according to him, were but one story <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>; which may pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> reconcile them together in this respect. It is observed, that those who give the height of these walls but at 50 cubits, speak of them only as they were after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DARIUS\">Darius</a> Hystaspis, who had caused them to be beaten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>. These walls formed an exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, each side of which was 120 furlongs, or 15 miles, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>; and were all built of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> bricks cemented together with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BITUMEN\">bitumen</a>, which in a short time grows harder than the very brick and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> which it cements. The city was encompassed, without the walls, with a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DITCH\">ditch</a> filled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and lined with bricks on both sides; and, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> that was dug out of it served to make the bricks, we may judge of the depth and largeness of the ditch from the height and thickness of the walls. In the whole compass of the wall there were 100 gates, that is, 25 on each of the four sides, all made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> bricks. Between every two of these gates, at proper distances, were three towers, and four more at the four corners of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> square, and three between each of these corners and the next gate on either side, and each of these towers was ten feet higher than the walls. But this is to be understood only of those parts of the walls where towers were needful for defense. For some parts of them being upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORASS\">morass</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INACCESSIBLE\">inaccessible</a> by an enemy, there the labour and cost was spared, which, though it must have spoiled the symmetry of the whole, must be allowed to have favoured of good economy; though that is what one would not have expected from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> who had been so determined, as Nebuchadnezzar must have been, to make the city complete both for strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>. The whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, then, of these towers amounted to no more than 250; whereas a much greater number would have been necessary to have made the uniformity complete all round. From each of the 25 gates on each side of this square, there was a straight street, extending to the corresponding gate in the opposite wall; whence the whole number of the streets must have been but 50; but then they were each about 15 miles long, 25 of them crossing the other 25 exactly at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>. Besides these whole streets, we must reckon four half streets, which were but rows of houses facing the four inner faces of the walls. These four half streets were properly the four sides of the city within the walls, and were each of them 200 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, the whole streets being about 150 of the same. By this interposition of the 50 streets, the city was divided into 676 squares, each of four furlongs and a half on each side, or two miles and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> in compass. Round these squares, on every side towards the streets, stood the houses, all of three or four stories in height, and beautified with all manner of ornaments; and the space within each of these squares was all void, and taken up by yards, or gardens, and the like, either for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> or convenience.\n\nA branch of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EUPHRATES\">Euphrates</a> divided the city into two, running through the midst of it, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> to south; over which, in the very middle of the city, was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-FURLONG\">furlong</a> in length, or rather more; and indeed much more, if we hearken to others, who say it was no less than five stades or furlongs in length, though but 30 feet broad, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> we shall never be able to decide. This bridge, however, is said to have been built with wonderful art, to supply a defect in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the river, which was all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a>. At each end of this bridge were two palaces: the old palace on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> side, the new one on the west side of the river; the former of which took up four of the squares above-mentioned, and the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a>. The temple of Belus, which stood next to the old palace, took up another of the same squares.\n\nThe whole city stood in a large flat or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, in a very fat and deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>: that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> or half of it on the\neast side of the river was the old city, and the other on the west was added by Nebuchadnezzar, both being included within the vast square bounded by the walls aforesaid. The form of the whole was seemingly borrowed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINEVEH\">Nineveh</a>, which was also 450 furlongs; but though it was equal in dimensions to this city, it was less with respect to its form, which was a parallelogram, whereas that of Babylon was an exact square.\n\nIt is supposed, that Nebuchadnezzar, who had destroyed that old seat of the Assyrian empire, proposed that this new one should rather exceed it; and that it was in order to fill it with inhabitants, that he transported such numbers of the captives from other countries hither; though that is what may be disputed, seeing he therein only followed the constant practice of the kings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSYRIA\">Assyria</a>, who thought this the most certain means of ensuring their conquests either to themselves or their posterity.\n\nBut it plainly appears, that it was never wholly inhabited; so that, even in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MERIDIAN\">meridian</a> of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, it may be compared with the flower of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>, which flourishes to-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and to-morrow is no more. It never had time to grow up to what Nebuchadnezzar visibly intended to have made it; for, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CYRUS\">Cyrus</a> removing the seat of the empire soon after Shulman, Babylon fell by degrees to utter decay: yet it must be owned, that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> was better able to support so vast and populous a city, had it been completed up to its first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>. But so far was it from being finished according to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> design, that, when Alexander came to Babylon, Q. Curtius tells us, \"No more than 90 furlongs of it were then built;\" which can be no otherwise understood than of so much in length; and, if we allow the breadth to be as much as the length (which is the utmost that can be allowed), it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> follow, that no more than 8100 square furlongs were then built upon: but the whole space within the walls contained 14,400 square furlongs; and therefore there must have been 6300 square furlongs remaining unbuilt, which, Curtius tells us, were ploughed and sown. And, besides this, the houses were not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a>, but all built with a void space on each side, between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> and house.\n\nThe next great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of Nebuchadnezzar was the temple of Belus. The wonderful tower, however, that stood in the middle of it, was not his work, but was built many ages before; that, and the famous tower of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BABEL\">Babel</a>, being, as is commonly supposed, one and the same structure. This tower is said to have been composed of eight pyramidal ones raised above one another, and by Herodotus said to have been a furlong in height; but as there is an ambiguity in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, it has been disputed whether each of the towers was a furlong in height, or the whole of them taken together. On the latter supposition, which is the most probable, this tower must have exceeded the height of the Egyptian pyramids by 170 feet, though it fell short of its breadth at the basis by 33. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to go up was by stairs on the outside round it; whence it seems most likely, that the whole ascent was, by the benching in, drawn in a sloping line from the bottom to the top eight times round it; and that this made the appearance of eight towers, one above the other. Till the times of Nebuchadnezzar, it is thought this tower was all the temple of Belus; but as he did by the other ancient buildings of the city, so he did by Babylon, this, making great additions thereto, by vast edifices erected round it, in a square of two furlongs on every side, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> in circumference, which exceeded the square at the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a> by 1800 feet. On the outside of these buildings was a wall, which enclosed the whole; and, in consideration of the regularity wherewith this city was to all appearance marked out, it is supposed, that this wall was equal to the square of the city wherein it stood, and so is concluded to have been two miles and a half in circumference. In this wall were several gates leading into the temple, and all of solid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>; which it is thought may have been made out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRAZEN_SEA\">brazen <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and brazen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILLARS\">pillars</a>, and other vessels and ornaments of the kind, which Nebuchadnezzar had transported from Jerusalem; for in this temple he is said to have dedicated his spoils from that of Jerusalem.\n\nIn this temple were several images or idols of maffy idols of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, and one of them, as we have seen, 40 feet in height; the same, as supposed, with that which Nebuchadnezzar consecrated in the plains of Dura. For though this last is said to have been 60 cubits, or 90 feet high, these dimensions appear so incredible, that it has been attempted to reconcile them into one, by supposing, that in the 90 feet the height of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEDESTAL\">pedestal</a> is included, and that the 40 feet are for the height of the statue without the pedestal; and being said to have weighed 1000 talents of Babylon, it is thence computed, that it was worth three millions and a half of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>. In a word, the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of the statues and decorations, in Diodorus Siculus, amounting to 3000 and odd talents in gold, the whole is estimated at above 21,000,000. of our money; and a sum about equal to the same, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a>, utensils, and ornaments, not mentioned, is allowed for.\n\nNext to this temple, on the east side of the river, stood the old palace of the kings of Babylon, being four miles in circumference. Exactly opposite to it, on the other side of the river, was the new palace built by Nebuchadnezzar, eight miles in circumference, and consequently four times as big as the old one.\n\nBut nothing was more wonderful at Babylon than the hanging-gardens, which Nebuchadnezzar made in gardens, compliance to his wife Amyte; who, being a Mede, and retaining a strong inclination for the mountains and forests of her own country, was desirous of having something like them at Babylon. They are said to have contained a square of four plethra, or 400 feet, on each side; and to have consisted of terraces one above another, carried up to the height of the wall of the city, the ascent from terrace to terrace being by steps ten feet wide. The whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILE\">pile</a> consisted of substantial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> upon arches, and was strengthened by a wall surrounding it on every side, 22 feet thick; and the floors on each of them were laid in this order; first, on the tops of the arches was laid a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BED\">bed</a> or pavement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> 16 feet long, and four feet broad; over this was a layer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REED\">reed</a> mixed with a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of bitumen; and over this two courses of brick, closely cemented together with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a>; and over all these were thick fleeces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, and on these the earth or mould of the garden. This floorage was designed to retain the moisture of the mould; which was so deep, as to give root to the greatest trees which were planted up.\non every terrace, together with great variety of other vegetables pleasing to the eye. Upon the uppermost of these terraces was a reservoir, supplied by a certain engine with water from the river, from whence the gardens on the other terraces were supplied.\n\nThe other works attributed to Nebuchadnezzar by Berossus and Abydenus, were the banks of the river, the artificial canals, and the great artificial lake said to have been sunk by Semiramis. The canals were cut out on the east side of the Euphrates, to convey the water of the river, when it overflowed its banks, into the Tigris, before they reached Babylon. The lake was on the west side of Babylon; and, according to the lowest computation, 40 miles square, 160 in compass, and in depth 35 feet, as we read in Herodotus, or 75, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEGASTHENES\">Megasthenes</a> will have it; the former, perhaps, measured from the surface of the sides, and the latter from the tops of the banks that were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> up upon them. This lake was dug to receive the waters of the river, while the banks were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> on each side of it. But both the lake, and the canal which led to it, were preferred after that work was completed, being found of great use, not only to prevent all overflows, but to keep water all the year, as in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> reservoir, to be let out, on proper occasions, by sluices, for the improvement of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a>.\n\nThe banks were built of brick and bitumen, on both sides of the river, to keep it within its channel; and extended on each side throughout the whole length of the city, and even farther, according to some, who reckon they extended 160 furlongs, or twenty miles; whence it is concluded they must have begun two miles and a half above the city, and have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> an equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> below it, the length of the city being no more than 15 miles. Within the city they were built from the bottom of the river, and of the same thickness with the walls of the city itself. Opposite to each street, on either side of the river, was a brazen gate in the said wall, with stairs leading down from it to the river: these gates were open by day, and shut by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>.\n\nBerossus, Megasthenes, and Abydenus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> all these works to Nebuchadnezzar; but Herodotus tells us, the bridge, the banks, and the lake, were the work of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> after him, called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NITOCRIS\">Nitocris</a>, who may have finished what Nebuchadnezzar left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>, and thence have had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> this historian gives her of the whole.\n\nThe tower or temple stood till the time of Xerxes. But that prince, on his return from the Grecian expedition, having first plundered it of its immense wealth, demolished the whole, and laid it in ruins. Alexander, on his return to Babylon from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> expedition, proposed to rebuild it, and accordingly set 10,000 men to work to clear away the rubbish. But his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> happening soon after, a stop was put to all further proceedings in that design. After the death of that conqueror, the city of Babylon began to decline apace; which was chiefly owing to the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SELEUCIA\">Seleucia</a>, built by Seleucus Nicator, as is said, out of state to the Babylonians, and peopled with 500,000 persons drawn from Babylon, by which that means continued declining till the very people of the country were at a loss to tell where it had stood.\n\nSuch is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> we have by ancient historians of the grandeur of this city; which, if these accounts are not exaggerated, must have exceeded every piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> grandeur that hath yet appeared. Many of the moderns, however, are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that these magnificent descriptions are very far from being true; although it is certain that few other arguments can be brought against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> of them, than that we do not see things of a similar kind executed in our own days. The following are the arguments used on this subject by the present Goguet.\n\n\"Authors have greatly extolled the public works and edifices which once rendered Babylon one of the wonders of the world. We may reduce all these objects to five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> heads: 1. the height of its walls; 2. the temple of Belus; 3. the hanging gardens; 4. the bridge built over the river Euphrates, and the quays which lined the river; 5. the lake and canals dug by the hand of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> to distribute the waters of the Euphrates.\n\n\"All these works, so marvellous in the judgment of Goguet's antiquity, appear to me to have been extremely exaggerated by the authors who have spoke of them. How can we conceive, in effect, that the walls of Babylon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of the could have been 318 feet high, and 81 in thickness, in relation to a compass of near ten leagues?\n\n\"I shall lay the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of that square building, known under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the temple of Belus. It was composed of eight towers placed one above another, diminishing always as they went up. Herodotus does not tell us what was the height of this monument. Diodorus says, that it surpassed all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRABO\">Strabo</a> fixes it to one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STADIUM\">stadium</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> which answers nearly to 600 of our feet. For in the time of this geographer the Iliad were much more considerable than in the first ages. The entire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of this building ought to have been antipodal to its excessive height; and this is also the idea that the ancients designed to give us of it. We may judge by the following fact. Xerxes had entirely demolished this temple. Alexander undertook to rebuild it. He designed to begin by clearing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> and removing the ruins. Ten thousand workmen who were employed two months in this work, were not, say they, able to finish it.\n\n\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> enclosed in the temple of Belus were proportioned to its immensity. Without speaking of the tables and censers, the cups and other sacred vases, of maffy gold, there was a statue 40 feet high, which alone weighed 1000 Babylonish talents. In short, according to the inventory that the ancients have given us of the riches contained in this temple, the total sum would amount to two hundred and twenty millions and a half of French livres. Exaggerations like these destroy themselves.\n\n\"As to the hanging gardens, according to all appearance they never existed. The silence of Herodotus on a work so singular and so remarkable, determines one to place in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of fables all that the other writers have delivered upon this pretended wonder. Herodotus had carefully visited Babylon. He enters into such details as prove that he has omitted none of the rarities of that city. Can we presume that he would have passed over in silence such a work as the hanging gardens? All the authors who have spoken of it are of much later <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> than this great historian. None of them except Berossus speaks on his own testimony.\"\nmony. It is always on the report of others. Diodorus had extracted from Ctesias what he says of these famous gardens. There is also great appearance that Strabo had drawn from the same source. In a word, the manner in which Quintus Curtius expresses himself sufficiently shows how much the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of these gardens appeared to him suspicious. He judged they owed the greatest part of it to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> of the Greeks.\n\n\"Let us now speak of the bridge of Babylon, which the ancients have placed in the number of the most marvellous works of the east. It was near 100 fathoms in length, and almost four in breadth. We cannot deny but that a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of art and labour was necessary to lay the foundations, which it could not be easy to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in the bed of an extremely deep and rapid river, which also rolls along a prodigious quantity of mud, and whose bottom is entirely sandy. They had therefore taken many precautions to secure the piers of the bridge of Babylon. They were built of stones joined and fastened together with cramps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> filled with melted lead. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the piers, turned towards the current of the Euphrates, was defended by buttresses extremely advanced, which diminished the weight and force of the water, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> it at a great distance. Such was the bridge of Babylon.\n\n\"While we do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to the skill of the Babylonians in conducting these works, we cannot help remarking the bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> which at all times reigned in the works of the eastern nations. The bridge of Babylon furnishes a striking instance of it. This edifice was absolutely without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a>, or any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a>. The breadth of it was in no sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to its length. The distance between the piers was also very ill contrived. They were distant from each other only 11 feet and a half. Finally, this bridge was not arched. We may judge of its effect on the view.\n\n\"The Babylonians, however, were not the only people who were ignorant of the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a>. This secret, as far as I can find, was unknown to all the people of remote antiquity, who, generally speaking, do not appear to have been very skilful in stone-cutting.\n\n\"As for the quays which lined the Euphrates, we may believe that they were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> and magnificent; but I shall not easily believe that they surpassed those which we have daily under our eye. In this respect, I believe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> may dispute it for magnificence, and for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the work, with all the cities of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>.\"\n\nBabylon, a town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> near the eastmost branch of the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a>, now supposed to be Grand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a>, or this city to stand near its ruins.

Indeed, these two kingdoms seem to have always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in such a state of friendship, that we can scarce help thinking they must have been the same, or perhaps Babylonia was for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Assyria. Nothing certain is known concerning either of them, except what may be gathered from Scripture. From thence we learn, that in the days of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a> there was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Shinar, called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMRAPHEL\">Amraphel</a>, who, under the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELAM\">Elam</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> upon the Canaanites. From this time we have nothing that can be depended upon till the days of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NABONASSAR\">Nabonassar</a>, the first king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLON\">Babylon</a> mentioned in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>'s canon. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, indeed, both from Scripture and profane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, that Babylonia subsisted as a distinct kingdom from Assyria even when the latter was in all its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>. The most probable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> is this: The empire of Assyria was founded by Pul, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the ruins of that of Damascus or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, in the days of Manahem king of Judah. This king left two sons, Tiglath-Pileser, and Nabonassar. To the former he bequeathed the empire of Assyria, and to the latter that of Babylon. Tiglath-Pileser resided at Nineveh, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> seat of the Assyrian empire; while Nabonassar, who was the younger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, held his residence at Babylon. As the two kingdoms were governed by princes of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, we may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> suppose a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> to have reigned between them, the younger branch at Babylon acknowledging a kind of subjection to the elder at Nineveh. That the Babylonian empire was of Assyrian origin, we are assured by the prophet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAIAH\">Isaiah</a>, in the following words:\n\n\"Behold the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a> of the Chaldeans: this people was not till the Assyrians founded it for them that dwelt in the wilderness: they set up the towers thereof; they built the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> thereof.\" As to the kingdom of Assyria, the Scripture mentions only five kings, viz. Pul, Tiglath-Pileser, Shalmaneser, Sennacherib, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESARHADDON\">Esarhaddon</a>; whose history, as related by the sacred writers, it is needless to mention particularly here. From the days of Nabonassar to Nabopolassar, that is, from the year before Christ 747 to 626, the kings of Babylon made no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, and were therefore probably in a state of dependence on the kings of Assyria; but at that time, in the reign of Chynnadan, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDANAPALUS\">Sardanapalus</a> of the Greeks, Nineveh was taken and destroyed by the Medes and Babylonians, and the seat of the empire transferred to Babylon. This Nabopolassar was the father of the famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol16.html#article-NEBUCHADNEZZAR\">Nebuchadnezzar</a>, for whose history we must refer to the sacred writers; and from his time to that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELSHAZZAR\">Belshazzar</a> of Daniel, and Nabonadius of other authors, the history of Babylon is little better than a mere blank. Of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of Babylon by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CYRUS\">Cyrus</a>, which happened at this time, we have the following account.\n\nWar had been begun betwixt the Medes, Persians, and Babylonians, in the reign of Neriglissar the father of Nabonadius, which had been carried on with very bad success on the side of the Babylonians. Cyrus, who commanded the Median and Persian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, having subdued the several nations inhabiting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> continent from the Aegean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EUPHRATES\">Euphrates</a>, bent his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> towards Babylon. Nabonadius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> of his march, immediately advanced against him with an army. In the engagement which ensued, the Babylonians were defeated; and the king, retreating to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>, was blockaded and closely besieged by Cyrus. The reduction of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> was no easy enterprise. The walls were of a prodigious height, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of men to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> them very great, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> stored with all sorts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> for 20 years. Cyrus, despairing of being able to take such a city by storm, caused a line\nof <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CIRCUMVALLATION\">circumvallation</a> to be drawn quite round it, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DITCH\">ditch</a>; reckoning, that if all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> were cut off, the besieged would be obliged to surrender through famine. That his troops might not be too much fatigued, he divided his army into twelve bodies, appointing each body its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENCHES\">trenches</a>; but the besieged, looking upon themselves to be out of all danger by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> walls and magazines, insulted him from the ramparts, and looked upon all the trouble he gave himself as so much unprofitable labour.\n\nAfter Cyrus had spent two whole years before Babylon, without making any progress in the siege, he at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> thought of the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STRATAGEM\">stratagem</a>, which put him in possession of it. He was informed, that a great annual solemnity was to be held at Babylon; and that the inhabitants on that occasion were accustomed to spend the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> in drinking and debauchery. This he therefore thought a proper time for surprising them; and accordingly sent a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the canal leading to the great lake, with orders, at a certain time, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> which was between the lake and the canal, and to turn the whole current into the lake. At the same time he appointed one body of troops at the place where the river entered the city, and another where it came out; ordering them to march in by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of the river as soon as they should find it fordable. Towards the evening he opened the head of the trenches on both sides the river above the city, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> might discharge itself into them; by which means, and the breaking down of the great dam, the river was soon drained. Then the two above-mentioned bodies of troops, according to their orders, entered the channel; the one commanded by Gobryas and the other by Gadates: and finding the gates all left open by reason of the disorders of that riotous night, they penetrated into the very heart of the city without opposition; and meeting, according to agreement, at the palace, they surprised the guards, and cut them in pieces. Those who were in the palace opening the gates to know the cause of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>, the Persians rushed in, took the palace, and killed the king, who came out to meet them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. Thus an end was put to the Babylonian empire; and Cyrus took possession of Babylon for one called in Scripture <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DARIUS\">Darius</a> the Mede, most probably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CYAXARES\">Cyaxares</a> II., uncle to Cyrus. From this time Babylonia never was erected into a distinct kingdom, but hath always followed the fortune of those great conquerors who at different times have appeared in Asia. It is now frequently the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of contention between the Turks and Persians. See Assyria.\n\nConcerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the country, manners, customs, &c. of the ancient Babylonians, the following account is collected by M. Sabbathier.\n\n\"As all the nations under the dominion of Cyrus, beside the ordinary tributes, were obliged to maintain him and his army, the monarch and his troops were supported by all Asia. The country of Babylon alone was obliged to maintain him four months of the year; its fertility, therefore, yielded a third of the produce of Asia. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of this country, which the Persians termed satrapy, was richer and more extensive than any of the rest. It maintained for the king, besides the war-horses, a stud of 800 stallions, and 16,000 mares. So great a number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> dogs Babylonia were likewise bred in this province for the king, that four of its cities kept those animals; and in return, they were exempted from all taxes and tributes.\n\n\"It rained very seldom in this country, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> was watered by the river, which was here diffused by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> industry, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a> is over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> by nature; for all the country of Babylon was divided by canals, the greatest of which was navigable, and flowed from south to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, from the Euphrates to the Tigris. In short, it was one of the finest countries for corn in the world; but for producing trees, the fig-tree, the vine, and the olive, it was not famous. It was so luxuriant in grain, that it commonly yielded a hundred times more than what was sown; and in good years it yielded three hundred times more than it received. The leaves of its wheat and barley were four inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>. 'Though I know,' says Herodotus, 'that the millet and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of that country grow to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of trees, I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not describe them particularly; lest those who have not been in Babylonia should think my account <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol8.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a>.'\n\n\"They had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> but what they made from Indian corn. The country abounded with palm-trees, which grew spontaneously; and most of them bore fruit, of which the inhabitants made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, wine, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>. They cultivated these trees and their fig-trees in the same manner. Some of them, as of other trees, the Greeks called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> ones. They tied the fruit of the male to the trees which bore dates; that the mosquito, leaving the male, might cause the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIPEN\">ripen</a>, by penetrating it; for without that affluence it came not to maturity. Mosquitos bred in the male palms as in the wild fig-trees.\n\n\"But we must not here omit to give an account of the peculiar and surprising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of their boats of skins, in which they sailed along the river to Babylon. These boats were invented by the Armenians, whose country lay north from Babylonia. They made them with poles of willow, which they bent, and covered with skins; the bare side of the skins they put outwards; and they made them so tight, that they resembled boards. The boats had neither prow nor stern, but were of a round form like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUCKLER\">buckler</a>. They put straw on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>. Two men, each with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAR\">oar</a>, rowed them down the river, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with different wares, but chiefly with palm wine. Of these boats some were very large, and some very small. The largest carried the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of 500 talents. There was room for an ass in one of their small boats; they put many into a large one. When they had unloaded, after their arrival at Babylon, they sold the poles of their boats and the straw; and loading their asses with the skins, returned to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMENIA\">Armenia</a>; for they could not fail up the river, its current was so rapid. For this reason they made their boats of skins, instead of wood; and on their return to Armenia with their asses, they applied the skins to their former use.\n\n\"As to their dress, they wore a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> shirt, which came down to their feet. Over it they wore a woollen robe; their outer garment was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> vest. Their shoes resembled those of the Thebans. They let their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> grow. On their heads they wore a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TURBAN\">turban</a>. They rubbed their bodies all over with fragrant liquors. Each\nEach <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a> on his finger, and an elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANE\">cane</a> in his hand, with an apple at the top, or a rose, a lily, or an eagle, or some other figure; for they were not suffered to use <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANES\">canes</a> without devices.\n\n\"With regard to their policy, Herodotus thinks that their best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> was one which the Heneti, an Illyrian people, likewise observed in every town and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a>. When the girls were marriageable, they were ordered to meet in a certain place, where the young men likewise assembled. They were then sold by the public crier; but he first sold the most beautiful one. When he had sold her at an immense price, he put up others to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>, according to their degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>. The rich Babylonians were emulous to carry off the finest women, who were sold to the highest bidders. But as the young men who were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> could not aspire to have fine women, they were content to take the ugliest with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> which was given them; for when the crier had sold the handsomest, he ordered the ugliest of all the women to be brought; and asked, if any one was willing to take her with a small sum of money. Thus she became the wife of him who was most easily satisfied; and thus the finest women were sold; and from the money which they brought, small fortunes were given to the ugliest, and to those who had any bodily infirmity. A father could not marry his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> as he pleased; nor was he who bought her allowed to take her home, without giving security that he would marry her. But, after the sale, if the parties were not agreeable to each other, the law enjoined that the purchase-money should be restored. The inhabitants of any of their towns were permitted to marry wives at these auctions. Such were the early customs of the Babylonians.\n\n\"But they afterwards made a law, which prohibited the inhabitants of different towns to intermarry, and by which husbands were punished for treating their wives ill. When they had become poor by the ruin of their metropolis, fathers used to prostitute their daughters for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a>. There was a sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> among the Babylonians, worthy to be related. They brought their sick into the forum, to consult those who passed on their diseases; for they had no physicians. They asked those who approached the sick, if they ever had the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTEMPER\">distemper</a>? If they knew any one who had it? and how he was cured? Hence, in this country, every one who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> a sick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> was obliged to go to him and inquire into his distemper.\n\n\"They embalmed their dead with honey; and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">mourning</a> was like that of the Egyptians.\n\n\"There were three Babylonian tribes, who lived only upon fish, and who prepared them in the following manner: they dried them in the sun, and then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> them in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a> to a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLOUR\">flour</a>, which after they had sifted through linen, they baked it in rolls.\n\n\"The Babylonians at first worshipped only the sun and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>; but they soon multiplied their deities. They deified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAAL\">Baal</a>, Bel, or Belus, one of their kings, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MERODACH\">Merodach</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALADAN\">Baladan</a>. They also worshipped <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENUS\">Venus</a>, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Mylitta. She and Belus were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> deities of the Babylonians. They counted their days from sunrise to sunrise. They solemnized five days of the year with great magnificence, and almost the same ceremonies with which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> celebrated their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURNALIA\">Saturnalia</a>.\n\n\"The Babylonians were very much addicted to judicial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTROLOGY\">astrology</a>. Their priests who openly professed that art, were obliged to commit to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> all the events of the lives of their illustrious men; and on a fancied connection between those events and the motions of the heavenly bodies, the principles of their art were founded. They pretended that some of their books, in which their historical transactions and revolutions were accurately compared with the courses of the stars, were thousands of years old. This assertion of their judicial astrologers we may reasonably dispute; but that their astronomers had made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, is incontestably true.

Though this Bacchus of the Egyptians was one of the elder gods of Egypt, yet the son of Semele was the youngest of the Grecian deities. Diodorus Siculus tells us, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORPHEUS\">Orpheus</a> first deified the son of Semele by the name of Bacchus, and appointed his ceremonies in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, in order to render the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CADMUS\">Cadmus</a>, the grandfather of the Grecian Bacchus, illustrious.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> Bacchus, according to Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton, flourished but one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> before the Argonautic expedition. This Bacchus, says Hermippus, was potent at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, conquered eastward as far as India, returned in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a>, brought his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> over the Hellespont, conquered Thrace, and left music, dancing, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> there. And, according to Diodorus Siculus, it was the son of Semele who invented farces and theatres, and who first established a music school, excepting from all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> functions such musicians as discovered great abilities in their art; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>, says the same author, musicians formed into companies have since frequently enjoyed great privileges.\n\nDr Burney * observes, that the dithyrambs which gave birth to dramatic representations, are as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> as the worship of Bacchus in Greece; and there is little doubt but that the ceremonies of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> gave rise to the pomp and illusions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>. Many of the most splendid exhibitions upon the stage for the entertainment of the people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a> and Rome, being performed upon the festivals of Bacchus, gave occasion to the calling all those that were employed in them, whether for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SINGING\">singing</a>, dancing, or reciting, servants of Bacchus.\n\nPaulanias, in his Attics, speaks of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> at Athens consecrated to Bacchus the finger; thus named, he says, for the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a> is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> and conductor of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSES\">muses</a>.

He understood the true principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> better than most masters of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, and was also a considerable painter in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a>; which induced Raphael to have recourse to him after he had quitted the school of Perugino; and under his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> likewise Raphael studied the art of managing and uniting colours, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the rules of perspective.

Du Cange deduces it from baccalaria, a kind of fees or farms, consisting of several pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, each whereof contained 12 acres, or as much as two oxen would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>: the possessors of which baccalaria were called bachelors. Cafeauve and Altaferra derive bachelor from baculus, or bacillus, \"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a>,\" because the young cavaliers exercised themselves in fighting with staves.

Knights are called in Latin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol8.html#article-EQUITES\">equites</a> aurati; aurati, from the gilt spurs they wore; and equites, because they always served on horseback: for it is observable, that almost all nations <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> their knights by some appellation derived from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>.

The table is divided into two parts, upon which there are 24 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> spaces, called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>. Each adversary has 15 men, black and white, to distinguish them; and they are disposed of in the following manner: Supposing the game to be played into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> table, two are placed upon the ace-point in the adversary's table, five upon the fix point in the opposite table, three upon the cinque point in the hitherto table, and five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the fix point in the right-hand table. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> in this game is for each player to bring his men round into his right-hand table, by throwing with a pair of dice those throws that contribute towards it, and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> prevent the adversary doing the like. The first best throw upon the dice is esteemed aces, because it stops the fix point in the outer table, and secures the cinque in the thrower's table; whereby the adversary's two men upon the thrower's ace point cannot get out with either quatre, cinque, or fix. This throw is an advantage often given to the antagonist by the superior player.\n\nWhen he carries his men home in order to lose no point, he is to carry the most distant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> to his adversary's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> point, that being the first stage he is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> it on; the next stage is fix points farther, viz. in the place where the adversary's five men are first placed out of his tables. He must go on in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> till all his men are brought home, except two, when by losing a point, he may often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the gammon, by throwing two fours or two fives.\n\nWhen a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HIT\">hit</a> is only played for, he should endeavour to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> either his own or adversary's cinque point; and if that fails by his being hit by the adversary, and he finds him forwarder than himself, in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> he must throw more men into the adversary's tables; which is done in this manner: He must put a man upon his cinque or bar point; and if the adversary neglects to hit it, he may then gain a forward game instead of a back game: but if the adversary hits him, he should play for a back game; and then the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of men which are taken up makes his game the better, because by these means he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> preserve his game at home: and then he should endeavour to gain both his adversary's ace and trois points, or his ace and deuce points, and take care to keep three men upon the adversary's ace point, that in case he hits him from thence, that point may remain still secure to himself.\n\nA back game should not be played for at the beginning of a set, because it would be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> disadvantage, the player running the risk of a gammon to win a single hit.\n\nRules for playing at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> out all the throws on the dice, when the player is to play for a gammon or for a single hit (A). 1.

The player must understand by the directions given to play for a gammon, that he is to make some blots on purpose, the odds being in his favour that they are not hit: but if it should happen that any blot is hit, as in this case there will be three men in the adversary's tables, he must then endeavour to secure the adversary's cinqe, quatre, or trois point, to prevent a gammon, and must be very cautious of his fourth man's not being taken up.\n\nHe must not crowd his game at any time if he can help it; that is to say, he should not put many men either upon the trois or deuce points in his own tables, being the same as losing those men, not having them in play. Besides, by crowding the game, and attempting to save a gammon, the player is often gammoned. His game being crowded in his own tables, the adversary has room to play as he thinks proper.\n\nThe following calculations will show the odds of entering a single man upon any certain number of points; and accordingly the game should be played.\n\nIt is necessary to know that there are thirty-six chances upon two dice, and the points that are upon these thirty-six chances are as follow:\n\n| Viz. | Points |\n|------|--------|\n| 2 Aces | - | 4 |\n| 2 Deuces | - | 8 |\n| 2 Trois | - | 12 |\n| 2 Fours | - | 16 |\n| 2 Fives | - | 20 |\n| 2 Sixes | - | 24 |\n| 6 And 5 twice | - | 22 |\n| 6 And 4 twice | - | 20 |\n| 6 And 3 twice | - | 18 |\n| 6 And 2 twice | - | 16 |\n| 6 And 1 twice | - | 14 |\n| 5 And 4 twice | - | 18 |\n| 5 And 3 twice | - | 16 |\n| 5 And 2 twice | - | 14 |\n| 5 And 1 twice | - | 12 |\n| 4 And 3 twice | - | 14 |\n| 4 And 2 twice | - | 12 |\n| 4 And 1 twice | - | 10 |\n| 3 And 2 twice | - | 10 |\n| 3 And 1 twice | - | 8 |\n| 2 And 1 twice | - | 6 |\n\nDivide by 36)294(8 and it proves, that upon an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> the player has a right to 8 points each throw.\nThe chances upon two dice calculated for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BACKGAMMON\">backgammon</a> are as follow:\n\n| 2 Sixes | - | 1 |\n|---------|---|---|\n| 2 Fives | - | 1 |\n| 2 Fours | - | 1 |\n| 2 Trois | - | 1 |\n| 2 Deuces| - | 1 |\n| + 2 Aces| - | 1 |\n| 6 And 5 twice | - | 2 |\n| 6 And 4 twice | - | 2 |\n| 6 And 3 twice | - | 2 |\n| 6 And 2 twice | - | 2 |\n| + 6 And 1 twice | - | 2 |\n| 5 And 4 twice | - | 2 |\n| 5 And 3 twice | - | 2 |\n| 5 And 2 twice | - | 2 |\n| + 5 And 1 twice | - | 2 |\n| 4 And 3 twice | - | 2 |\n| 4 And 2 twice | - | 2 |\n| + 4 And 1 twice | - | 2 |\n| 3 And 2 twice | - | 2 |\n| + 3 And 1 twice | - | 2 |\n| + 2 And 1 twice | - | 2 |\n\nTotal, 11\n\nAs it may seem difficult to find out by this table of thirty-fix chances what are the odds of being hit upon a certain or flat die, let the following method be pursued.\n\nThe player may observe in the table that what are thus + marked are,\n\n+ 2 Aces - 1\n+ 6 And 1 twice - 2\n+ 5 And 1 twice - 2\n+ 4 And 1 twice - 2\n+ 3 And 1 twice - 2\n+ 2 And 1 twice - 2\n\nTotal, 11\n\nWhen deducted from - 36\n\nThere remains - 25\n\nSo that it appears it is twenty-five to eleven against hitting an ace upon a certain or flat die.\n\nThe above method holds good with respect to any other flat die. For example, what are the odds of entering a man upon 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 points?\n\nAnswer.\n\nTo enter it upon for against for ag.\n1 point is 11 to 25 Or about 4 to 9\n2 points 20 - 16 - 5 4\n3 - 27 - 9 - 3 1\n4 - 32 - 4 - 8 1\n5 - 35 - 1 - 35 1\n\nThe following table shows the odds of hitting with any chance, in the reach of a single die.\n\nTo hit upon for against for ag.\n1 is - 11 to 25 Or about 4 to 9\n2 - 12 - 24 - 1 - 2\n3 - 14 - 22 - 2 - 3\n4 - 15 - 21 - 5 - 7\n5 - 15 - 21 - 5 - 7\n6 - 17 - 19 - 8\u00bd 9\u00bd\n\nThe odds of hitting with double dice are as follow:\n\nTo hit upon for against for ag.\n7 is - 6 to 30 Or about 1 to 5\n8 - 6 30 - 1 5\n9 - 5 31 - 1 6\n10 - 3 33 - 1 11\n11 - 2 34 - 1 17\n12 - 1 36 - 1 35\n\nHow to find out the odds of being hit upon a fix, by the table of thirty-fix chances.\n\n| 2 Sixes | - | 1 |\n| 2 Trois | - | 1 |\n| 2 Deuces| - | 1 |\n| 6 And 5 twice | - | 2 |\n| 6 And 4 twice | - | 2 |\n| 6 And 3 twice | - | 2 |\n| 6 And 2 twice | - | 2 |\n| 6 And 1 twice | - | 2 |\n| 5 And 4 twice | - | 2 |\n| 5 And 3 twice | - | 2 |\n| 5 And 2 twice | - | 2 |\n| 5 And 1 twice | - | 2 |\n| 4 And 2 twice | - | 2 |\n\nWhich deducted from - 36\n\nThere remains - 19\n\nBy which it appears to be 19 to 17 against being hit upon a fix.\n\nThe odds on the hits.\n\n| 2 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOVE\">Love</a> is about | - | 5 to 2 |\n| 2 to 1 is | - | 2 1 |\n| 1 Love is | - | 3 2 |\n\nDirections for the player to bear his men. If a player has taken up two of the adversary's men, and happens to have two, three, or more points made in his own tables, he should spread his men, that he either may take a new point in his tables, or be ready to hit the man which the adversary may happen to enter. If he finds upon the adversary's entering, that the game is upon a par, or that the advantage is on his own side, he should take the adversary's man up whenever he can, it being 25 to 11 that he is not hit: except when he is playing for a single hit only; then, if playing the throw otherwise gives him a better chance for it, he ought to do it.\n\nIt being five to one against his being hit with double dice, he should never be deterred from taking up any one man of the adversary's.\n\nIf he has taken up one of the adversary's men, and should happen to have five points in his own tables, and forced to leave a blot out of his tables, he should endeavour to leave it upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DOUBLETS\">doublets</a> preferable to any other chance, because in that case the odds are 35 to one that he is not hit; whereas it is only 17 to one but he is hit upon any other chance.\n\nWhen the adversary is very forward, a player should never move a man from his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, trois, or deuce points, thinking to bear that man from the point where he put it, as nothing but high doublets can give him any chance for the hit. Instead of playing an ace or a deuce from any of those points, he should play them from his own size or highest points, so that throwing two fives, or two fours, his size and cinque points being eased, would be a considerable advantage.\nto him; whereas had they been loaded, he must have been obliged to play otherwife.\n\nIt is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of the adversary to take up the player as soon as he enters. The blot should be left upon the adversary's lowest point; that is to say, upon his deuce point rather than upon his trois point; or upon his trois point rather than his quatre point, or upon his quatre point preferable to his cinque point, for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> before mentioned; all the men the adversary plays upon his trois or his deuce points are deemed lost, being greatly out of play; so that those men not having it in their power to make his cinque point, and his game being crowded in one place and open in another, the adversary must be greatly annoyed by the player.\n\nIf the player has two of the adversary's men in his tables, he has a better chance for a hit than if he had more, provided his game is forwarder than that of his antagonist's; for if he had three or more of the adversary's men in his tables, he would stand a worse chance to be hit.\n\nWhen a player is running to save the gammon, if he should have two men upon his ace point, and several men abroad, although he should lose one point or two in putting his men into his tables, it is his interest to leave a man upon the adversary's ace point, because it will prevent his adversary from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> his men to the greatest advantage, and at the same time the player will have a chance of the adversary's making a blot, which he may chance to hit. However, if a player finds upon a throw, that he has a probability of saving his gammon, he should never wait for a blot, as the odds are greatly against his hitting it, but should embrace that opportunity.\n\nHow to calculate the odds of saving or winning the gammon. Suppose the adversary has so many men abroad as require three throws to put them into his tables, and at the same time that the player's tables are made up, and that he has taken up one of the adversary's men; in this case, it is about an equal wager that the adversary is gammoned. For in all probability the player has bore two men before he opens his tables, and when he bears the third man, he will be obliged to open his size or cinque point. It is then probable, that the adversary is obliged to throw twice before he enters his men in the player's tables, twice more before he puts that man into his own tables, and three throws more to put the men which are abroad into his own tables, in all seven throws. Now the player having 12 men to bear, he may be forced to make an ace or a deuce twice before he can bear all his men, and consequently will require seven throws in bearing them; so that, upon the whole, it is about equal whether the adversary is gammoned or not.\n\nSuppose a player has three men upon his adversary's ace point and five points in his own tables, and that the adversary has all his men in his tables, three upon each of his five highest points. Has the player a probability of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GAMMONING\">gammoning</a> his adversary or not?\n\nPoints.\n\nFor bearing three men from his 6th point is 18\nFrom his 5th point 15\n\nCarried forward\nFrom his 4th point 33\nFrom his 3d point 12\nFrom his 2d point 6\n\nIn all 60\n\nBringing his three men from the adversary's ace point to his size point in his own tables, being 18 points each, and making together 54\n\nThere must remain 6\n\nIt is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> from this calculation, that the player has much the best of the probability of the gammon, exclusive of one or more blots which the adversary is liable to make in bearing his men, supposing at the same time the throws to be upon an equality.\n\nSuppose two blots are left, either of which cannot be hit but by double dice; one must be hit by throwing eight and the other by throwing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a>; so that the adversary has only one die to hit either of them. What are the odds of hitting either of them? The chances of two dice being in all 36\n\nThe chances to hit 8 are 6 and 2 twice 2\n5 and 3 twice 2\n2 Deuces 1\n2 Fours 1\nThe chances to hit 9 are 6 and 3 twice 2\n5 and 4 twice 2\n2 Trois 1\n\nFor hitting in all 11\nChances for not hitting, remain 25\n\nSo that the odds are 25 to 11 against hitting either of these blots.\n\nThis method may be taken to find out the odds of hitting three, four, or five blots upon double dice; or blots made upon double and single dice at the same time. After knowing how many chances there are to hit any of those blots, they must be added all together, and then subtracted from the number 36, which are the chances of the two dice, and the question is solved.\n\nA critical case for a Back-game. Suppose the foregame to be played by A, and that all his men are placed as usual; B has fourteen of his men placed upon his adversary's ace point and one man upon his adversary's deuce point, and B is to throw. Who has the best of the hit?\u2014Answer: A has the best of it, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> to silver: because, if B does not throw an ace to take his adversary's deuce point, which is 25 to 11 against him, A will take up B's men in his tables, either singly or to make points; and then if B secures either A's deuce or trois point, A will put as many men down as possible, in order to hit, and thereby get a back-game. It is evident that the back-game is very powerful; consequently, whoever practises it must become a greater proficient at the game than he could by any other means.\n\nAnother critical case. Suppose A to have five men placed upon his size point, as many upon his quatre point, and the same number upon his deuce point, all in his own tables. At the same time, let us suppose B to have three men placed upon A's ace point, as many\nmany upon A's trois point, and the same number upon A's cinque point, in his own tables, and three men placed as usual out of his tables. Who has the best of the hit? \u2014 Answer: The game is equal till B has gained his cinque and quatre points in his own tables; which if he can effect, and by playing two men from A's cinque point, in order to force his adversary to blot by throwing an ace, which should B hit, he will have the best of the hit.\n\nA case of curiosity and instruction: in which is shown the probability of making the hit last by one of the players for many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, although they shall both play as fast as usual. Suppose B to have bore 13 men, and that A has his fifteen men in B's tables, viz. three men upon his five point, as many upon his cinque point, three upon his quatre point, the same number upon his trois point, two upon his deuce point, and one upon his ace point. A in this situation can prolong it, as aforesaid by bringing his 15 men home, always securing six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> points till B has entered his two men, and brought them upon any certain point; as soon as B has gained that point, A will open an ace, deuce, or trois point, or all of them; which done, B hits one of them, and A taking care to have two or three men in B's tables, is ready to hit that man; and also being certain of taking up the other man, has it in his power to prolong the hit almost to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, provided he takes care not to open such points as two fours, two fives, or two sixes, but always to open the ace, deuce, or trois points, for B to hit him.\n\nA critical game to play. Suppose A and B place their men for a hit in the following manner: A to have three men upon the five point in his own tables, three men out of his tables upon the usual point, and nine men upon his adversary's ace, deuce, and trois points; that is, three upon each: and suppose B's men to be placed in his own and his adversary's tables in the same order. So situated, the best player should win the hit. The game being so equal, that in this case the dice should be thrown for. Now if A throws first, he should endeavour to gain his adversary's cinque point: this being done, he should lay as many blots as possible, to tempt B to hit him, as it puts him backward, and A thereby gains an advantage. A should always endeavour to have three men upon each of his adversary's ace and deuce points; because when B makes a blot, these points will remain secure, and when A has bore five, six, or more men, A yet may secure six close points out of his tables, in order to prevent B from getting his man home, at which time he should calculate who has the best of the hit. If he finds that B is foremost, he should then try to lay such blots as may be taken up by his adversary, that he may have a chance of taking up another man, in case B should happen to have a blot at home.\n\nLaws of Back-gammon. 1. If a man is taken from any point, it must be played; if two men are taken from it, they also must be played. 2. A man is not supposed to be played till it is placed upon a point and quitted. 3. If a player has only fourteen men in play, there is no penalty inflicted, because by his playing with a lesser number than he is entitled to, he plays to a disadvantage for want of the deficient man to make up his tables. 4. If he bears any number of men before he has entered a man taken up, and which of course he was obliged to enter, such men to borne must be entered again in the adversary's tables as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the man taken up. 5. If he has mistaken his throw and played it, and his adversary has thrown, it is not in the choice of either of the players to alter it, unless they both agree so to do.\n\nBack-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAINTING\">Painting</a>, the method of painting mezzotinto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol17.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a>, pasted on glass, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>-colours. See Mezzotinto.\n\nThe art consists chiefly in laying the print upon a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>-glass, of such a size as fits the print.\n\nIn order to do this, take your print, and lay it in clean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> for two days and two nights, if the print be on very strong, clothe, and hard gummed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>; but if upon an open, soft, spongy paper, two hours will sometimes suffice, or more, according as the paper is.\n\nThe paper or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> having been sufficiently soaked, take it out and lay it upon two sheets of paper, and cover it with two more; and let it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> there a little to suck out the moisture.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, take the glass the picture is to be put upon, and set it near the fire to warm; take Strasbourg <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TURPENTINE\">turpentine</a>, warm it over the fire till it is grown fluid, then with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HOG\">hog</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> spread the turpentine very smoothly and evenly on the glass.\n\nWhen this has been done, take the mezzotinto print from between the papers, and lay it upon the glass; beginning first at one end, rubbing it down gently as you go on, till it lie close, and there be no wind bladders between.\n\nThen, with your fingers, rub or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROLL\">roll</a> off the paper from the backside of the print, till it looks black, i.e., till you can see nothing but the print, like a thin film, left upon the glass, and let it by to dry.\n\nWhen it is dry, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a> it over with some white transparent varnish, that the print may be seen through it; and then it is fit for painting.\n\nThe utmost care will be necessary in rubbing or rolling the paper off the print, so as not to tear it, especially in the light parts.\n\nYou may, instead of soaking your prints two days and two nights, roll them up and boil them for about two hours, more or less, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the paper, in water; and that will render it as fit for rubbing, rolling, or peeling, as the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>.\n\nThis being done, and your oil-colours prepared, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> very fine, and tempered up very stiff, lay on the back side of the transparent prints such colours as each particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> requires; letting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>-lines of the print still guide your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a>, and to each particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> will lie fair to the eye on the other side of the glass, and look almost as well as a painted piece, if it be done neatly.\n\nThe shadows of the print are generally sufficient for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> of every colour; but if you have a mind to give a shadow by your pencil, then let the shadows be laid on first, and the other colours afterward.\n\nIn laying on colours in this kind of back-painting, you need not be curious as to the laying them on smooth. This is not at all requisite here, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> aim is only to have the colours appear well on the fore side of the print; and therefore the only care to\nBack-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a> be used in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, is to lay the colours on thick enough, that its body may strike the colour of it plainly through the glass.\n\nBack-Staff, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> formerly given to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a> invented by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Davis; because the back of the artifit is turned towards the sun at the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>.

After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his father, he lived in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of Jacopo Palermo, a dealer in pictures, who avociously took care to keep him incessantly employed, and sent his paintings to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> to be disposed of, where they happened to be exceedingly admired. The judicious were very eager to purchase them; and though the tranactor sold them at a great price, yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> artist was not proportionally rewarded, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in the same obscure and deprested condition. His merit, indeed, was universally allowed, but his name, and the narrowness of his circumstances, were as universally unknown. He had a clean light manner of pencilling, and a tint of colour that was extremely agreeable.\u2014He died in 1560.\n\nBacker, or Barker, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a>, painter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> and history, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARLINGEN\">Harlingen</a> in 1609, but spent the greatest part of his life at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a>; and by all the writers on this subject, he is mentioned as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> painter, particularly of portraits, which he executed with strength, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>, and a graceful resemblance. He was remarkable for an uncommon readiness of hand and freedom of pencil; and his incredible expedition in his manner of painting, appeared even in one portrait of a lady from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAARLEM\">Haarlem</a>, that he painted at half length, which was begun and finished in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, though he adorned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> with rich drapery and several ornamental jewels. He also painted historical subjects with good success; and in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> there is a fine picture of Cimon and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol9.html#article-IPHIGENIA\">Iphigenia</a>, which is accounted by the connoisseurs an excellent performance. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGNING\">designing</a> academy figures his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> was so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a>, and his outline so correct, that he obtained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> from all his competitors; and his works are still bought up at very high prices in the Low Countries. In the collection of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELECTOR\">Elector</a> Palatine there is an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of Brouwer, painted by this master; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARMELITES\">Carmelites</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> at Antwerp is preserved a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> picture of the Last Judgment, which is well designed and well coloured. He died in 1651.\n\nBackereel, called Bacquerelli, William, a painter of history, was born at Antwerp, and was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Rubens, at the same time that Vandyck was educated in that school. When each of them quitted that master, and commenced painters, Backereel was very little inferior to Vandyck, if not nearly his equal. And this may be manifestly seen in the works of the former, which are in the church of the Augustin monks at Antwerp; where those two great artists painted in competition, and both were praised for their merit in their different ways; but the superiority was never determined in favour either of the one or the other. He had likewise a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>; but, by exercising that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> too freely, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> satires against the Jesuits, these ecclesiastics pursued him with unremitting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a>, till they compelled him to fly from Antwerp; and by that means deprived his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> of such paintings as would have contributed to its perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>.\u2014Sandrart takes notice, that in his time there were seven or eight painters, who were very eminent, of the name of Backereel, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> and the Low Countries.\n\nBackhuyzen, Ludolph, an eminent painter, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMDEN\">Emden</a> in 1631, and received his earliest instruction from Albert Van Everdingen; but acquired his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> knowledge by frequenting the painting rooms of different great masters, and observing their various methods of touching and colouring. One of these masters was Henry Dubbels, whose understanding in his art was very extensive; and he was as remarkably communicative of his knowledge to others. From him Backhuyzen obtained more real benefit than from all the painters of his time, either by studying their works, or personally conversing with them. His subjects were sea-pieces, ships, and sea-ports. He had not practised very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> when he became the object of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> admiration; so that even his drawings were fought after, and several of them were bought up at 100 florins a-piece. It was observed of him, that while he was painting, he would not suffer even his most intimate friends to have access to him, lest his fancy might be disturbed, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> he had formed in his mind be interrupted. He studied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> attentively in all her forms; in gales, calms, storms, clouds, rocks, skies, lights, and shadows; and he expressed every subject with so sweet a pencil, and such transparency and lustre, as placed him above all the artists of his time in that style, except the younger Vandervelde, who is deservedly esteemed the first in that manner of painting. It was a frequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> with Backhuyzen, whenever he could procure resolute mariners, to go to sea in a storm, in order to store his mind with grand images, directly copied from nature, of such scenes as would have filled any other head and heart with terror and dismay; and the moment he landed he always impatiently ran to his palette to secure those incidents of which the traces might by delay be obliterated.\u2014He perfectly understood the management of the chiaroscuro, and by his skill in that part of his art, gave uncommon force and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> to his objects. He observed strictly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a>, in the distances of his vessels, the receding of the grounds on the shores, and the different buildings which he described in the sea-ports; whether they were the result of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, or sketched, as he usually did, after nature. His works may easily be distinguished by an observant eye, from the freedom and neatness of his touch; from the clearness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a> or quiescence of the water; from a peculiar tint in his clouds and skies; and also from the exact proportions\nof his ships, and the gracefulness of their position. For the burgomasters of Amsterdam he painted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> picture, with a multitude of vessels, and a view of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, for which they gave him thirteen hundred guilders, and a considerable present; which picture they afterwards presented to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a> of France, who placed it in the Louvre. No painter was ever more honoured by the visits of kings and princes than Backhuyzen; the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a> was one of the number; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CZAR\">czar</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> the Great took delight to see him paint, and often endeavoured to draw after vessels which he had designed. He was remarkably affiduous, and yet it seems astonishing to consider the number of pictures which he finished, and the exquisite manner in which they are painted.

Thence he removed to the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, which, in those times, was esteemed the centre of literature. Here, we are told, he made so rapid a progress in the sciences, that he was esteemed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of that university, and was much cared for by several of his countrymen, particularly by Robert Grouthead, afterwards bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a>, his singular friend and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a>. Bacon. About the year 1240, he returned to Oxford; and assuming the Franciscan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>, prosecuted his favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXPERIMENTAL_PHILOSOPHY\">experimental <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> with unremitting ardour and assiduity. In this pursuit, in experiments, instruments, and in scarce books, he tells us, he spent, in the space of 20 years, no less than 2000l.; which, it seems, was given him by some of the heads of the university, to enable him to prosecute his noble inquiries. But such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> talents, and astonishing progress in sciences, which, in that ignorant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, were totally unknown to the rest of mankind, whilst they raised the admiration of the more intelligent few, could not fail to excite the envy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALICE\">malice</a> of his illiterate fraternity; who found no difficulty of professing the vulgar with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of Bacon's dealing with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a>. Under this pretence, he was restrained from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> lectures; his writings were confined to his convent; and finally, in 1278, he himself was imprisoned in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CELL\">cell</a>. At this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he was 64 years of age. Nevertheless, being permitted the use of his books, he went <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> in the rational pursuit of knowledge, corrected his former labours, and wrote several curious pieces. When he had been 10 years in confinement, Jerom de Acoli being elected pope, Bacon solicited his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a> to be released; in which, it seems, he did not immediately succeed. However, towards the latter end of that pope's reign, he obtained his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, and spent the remainder of his life in the college of his order, where he died in the year 1294, in the 80th year of his age, and was buried in the Franciscan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>.

These printed works of Bacon contain a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of essays, which, in the catalogue of his writings by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALE\">Bale</a>, Pits, &c., have been considered as distinct books; but there remain in different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LIBRARIES\">libraries</a> several manuscripts not yet published. By an attentive perusal of his works, the reader <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be astonished to find, that this great luminary of the 13th-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> was a great linguist and a skilful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAMMARIAN\">grammarian</a>, that he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> versed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> and practice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a>; that he understood the use of convex and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCAVE\">concave</a> glasses, and the art of making them: that the camera obscura, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>-glasses, and the power of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a> were known to him; that he was well versed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>; that he knew the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALENDAR\">calendar</a>, assigned the cause, and professed the remedy; that he understood <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">chronology</a> well; that he was an adept in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>, and was really the inventor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GUN\">gun</a>-powder; that he possessed great knowledge in the medical art; that he was an able mathematician, logician, metaphysician, and theologian.","sp":363,"ep":363},{"h":"BACON","t":"Sir Nicholas, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> keeper of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a> in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, was born at Chilham, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a>, in 1510, and educated at the university.\nty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>; after which he travelled into France, and made some stay at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">On</a> his return, he settled in Gray's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INN\">Inn</a>, and applied himself with such assiduity to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, that he quickly distinguished himself so, that on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONASTERY\">monastery</a> of St Edmund's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">Bury</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUFFOLK\">Suffolk</a>, he had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">King</a> Henry VIII., in the 36th year of his reign, of several manors. In the 38th of the same king, he was promoted to the office of attorney in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of wards, which was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> both of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> and profit. In this office he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> by King Edward VI.; and in 1552 he was elected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol20.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a> of Gray's Inn. His great moderation and consummate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> preserved him through the dangerous reign of Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>. In the very dawn of that of Elizabeth he was knighted; and on the 22d of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1558, the great seal of England, being taken from Nicolas Heath <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, was delivered to him with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of lord keeper, and he was also made one of the queen's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-PRIVY_COUNCIL\">privy <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>. He had a considerable share in the settling of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>: as a statesman, he was remarkable for a clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> and deep counsels: but his great parts and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> preferment were far from raising him in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, as appears from the modest answer he gave Queen Elizabeth, when she told him his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> at Redgrave was too little for him: \"Not so, madam, (returned he); but your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a> has made me too great for my house.\" After having had the great seal more than 20 years, this able statesman and faithful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNSELLOR\">counsellor</a> was suddenly removed from this life, as Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALLET\">Mallet</a> informs us, by the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a>: he was under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARBER\">barber</a>, and thinking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> warm, had ordered a window before him to be thrown open, but fell asleep as the current of fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> was blowing upon him, and awakened some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> after distempered all over. He was immediately removed into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BED\">bed</a>-chamber, where he died a few days after, on the 26th of February 1578-9, equally lamented by the queen and her subjects. He was buried in St Paul's, where a monument was erected to him, which was destroyed by the fire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> in 1666. Mr Granger observes, that he was the first lord keeper that ranked as lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a>; and that he had much of that penetrating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a>, and judgment, persuasive eloquence, and comprehensive knowledge of law and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a>, which afterwards shone forth to great a lustre in his son, who was as much inferior to his father in point of prudence and integrity, as his father was to him in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> accomplishments.\n\nBacon, Francis, lord high chancellor of England under King James I., was son of Sir Nicholas Bacon lord keeper of the great seal in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Sir Anthony Cook, eminent for her skill in the Latin and Greek tongues. He was born in 1561; and showed such marks of genius, that he was particularly taken notice of by Queen Elizabeth when very young. He was educated at Trinity <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, Cambridge; and made such incredible progress in his studies, that, before he was 16, he had not only run through the whole circle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERAL_ARTS\">liberal arts</a> as they were then taught, but began to perceive those imperfections in the reigning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, which he afterwards so effectually exposed, and thereby not only overturned that tyranny which prevented the progress of true knowledge, but laid the foundation of that free and useful philosophy which has since opened a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to so many glorious discoveries. On his leaving the university, his father sent him to France; where, before he was 19 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, he wrote a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> view of the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>; but Sir Nicholas dying, he was obliged suddenly to return to England; when he applied himself to the study of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> law, at Gray's Inn. At this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> the famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSEX\">Essex</a>, who could distinguish merit, and who passionately loved it, entered into an intimate friendship with him; zealously attempted, though without success, to procure him the office of queen's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLICITOR\">solicitor</a>; and, in order to comfort his friend under the disappointment, conferred on him a present of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a> to the value of \u00a31000. Bacon, notwithstanding the friendship of so great a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>; notwithstanding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> and power of his own relations; and, above all, notwithstanding the early prepossession of her majesty in his favour; met with many obstacles to his preferment during her reign. In particular, his enemies represented him as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, whose head was filled with philosophical notions, and therefore more likely to perplex than forward public business. It was not without great difficulty that lord treasurer Burleigh obtained for him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVERSION\">reversion</a> of regilter to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STAR_CHAMBER\"><a class=\"xr</a>ef\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a>-chamber, worth about \u00a36000 a-year, which place fell to him about 20 years after. Neither did he obtain any other preferment all this reign; though if obedience to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> in what must be the most disagreeable of all offices, viz. the casting reflections on a deceased friend, entitled him, he might have claimed it. The people were so clamorous even against the queen herself on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Essex, that it was thought necessary to vindicate the conduct of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a>. This was affixed to Bacon, which brought on him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> censure, nay his very life was threatened. Upon the accession of King James, he was soon raised to considerable honours; and wrote in favour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of the two kingdoms of Scotland and England, which the king so passionately desired. In 1616, he was sworn of the privy-council. He then applied himself to the reducing and recomposing the laws of England. He distinguished himself, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTORNEY_GENERAL\">attorney-general</a>, by his endeavours to restrain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of duels, then very frequent. In 1617, he was appointed lord keeper of the great seal. In 1618, he was made lord chancellor of England, and created Lord Verulam. In the midst of these honours and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a>, and multiplicity of business, he forgot not his philosophy, but in 1620 published his great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> entitled Novum Organum. We find by several letters of his, that he thought convening of parliaments was the best expedient for the king and people. In 1621, he was advanced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VISCOUNT\">Viscount</a> St Albans, and appeared with the greatest splendour at the opening of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SESSION\">session</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>. But he was soon after surprized with a melancholy reverse of fortune. For, about the 12th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> of the house of commons was appointed to inspect the abuses of the courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. The first thing they fell upon was bribery and corruption, of which the lord chancellor was accused. For that very year complaints being made to the house of commons of his lordship's having received bribes, those complaints were sent up to the house of lords; and new ones being daily made of a like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, things soon grew\ngrew too high to be got over. The king found it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> both his chancellor, who was openly accused of corruption, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUCKINGHAM\">Buckingham</a> his favourite, who was secretly and therefore more dangerously attacked as the encourager of whatever was deemed most illegal and oppressive: he therefore forced the former to abandon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, giving him positive advice to submit himself to his peers, and promising upon his princely word to screen him in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a>, if that could not be, to reward him afterwards with an ample retribution of favour. The chancellor, though he foresaw his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> ruin if he did not plead for himself, resolved to obey; and the house of peers, on the 3rd of May 1621, gave judgment against him, \"That he should be fined 40,000l. and remain prisoner in the Tower during the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>; that he should for ever be incapable of any office, place, or employment, in the state or commonwealth; and that he should never sit in parliament, or come within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERGE\">verge</a> of the court.\" The fault which, next to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INGRATITUDE\">ingratitude</a> to Essex, thus tarnished the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of this illustrious man, is said to have principally proceeded from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol12.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> to his servants, who made a corrupt use of it. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, during his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, passing through a room where several of his domestics were sitting, upon their rising up to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALUTE\">salute</a> him, he said, \"Sit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, my masters; your rise hath been my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>.\" Stephens, p. 54. And we are told by Ruffeworth, in his historical collections, \"That he treated up nothing for himself or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, but was over-indulgent to his servants, and connived at their takings, and their ways betrayed him to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>; they were profuse and expensive, and had at their command whatever he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of. The gifts taken were for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> for interlocutory orders; his decrees were generally made with so much equity, that though gifts rendered him suspected for injustice, yet never any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> made by him was reversed as unjust.\" It was peculiar to this great man (say the authors of the Biogr. Brit.) to have nothing narrow and selfish in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>: he gave away without concern whatever he possessed; and believing other men of the same mould, he received with as little consideration. He retired, after a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPRISONMENT\">imprisonment</a>, from the engagements of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> life, to which he had been called much against his genius, to the shade of a contemplative one, which he had always loved. The king remitted his fine, and he was summoned to parliament in the first year of King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I. It appears from the works composed during his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RETIREMENT\">retirement</a>, that his thoughts were still free, vigorous, and noble. The last five years of his life he devoted wholly to his studies. In his recess he composed the greatest part of his English and Latin works. He expired on the 9th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 1626; and was buried in St Michael's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> at St Albans, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of his last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, where a monument of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> marble was erected to him by Sir Thomas Meautys, formerly his secretary, and afterward clerk of the privy council under two kings. A complete edition of this great man's works was published at London in the year 1740.\u2014Addison has said of him, That he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>, distinct, comprehensive knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, with all the beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> graces and embellishments of Cicero.

That it was in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, appears indisputably from Scripture; but that it was exactly in the same place is what cannot be proved, nor is it a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>.\n\nAuthors have been much divided about the motive by which the whole race of mankind were induced to join as one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> in such an undertaking. Some have imagined that it was out of fear of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> deluge; others, that they knew beforehand that they were to be dispersed through all the different countries of the world, and built this tower in order to defeat the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>, because having a tower of such vast height as they proposed, those who were at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> could easily find their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> back again. Had either of these been their design, however, it is probable they would have chosen an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> rather than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> for the situation of their tower, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> indeed that they would have chosen some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> mountain, such as Ararat, for their mark, rather than any tower at all: for though it is said that they designed the top of their tower to reach to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, we can scarce suppose them to have been so absurd, as to imagine this possible in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> we understand it; and must therefore rather take it in the limited sense in which it is often used by Moses and his countrymen, where they speak of cities walled up to heaven. Others there are who imagine that the top of this tower was not to reach up to heaven, but to be consecrated to the heavens, i.e., to the worship of the sun, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> and stars; of the fire, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, &c. and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> powers, as deities; and therefore that the true Deity interposed in order to prevent a total and irrecoverable defection. Certain it is, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of idolatry which takes for the objects of its worship those natural agents, as it is the most ancient, so it is by far the most rational, and the most difficult to be disproved. It is much more difficult, for instance, to prove that the sun, which by his enlivening beams gives vigour to the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>, is not a deity, than that a log of wood is not one: and hence if such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> became universally established among mankind, it would be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> ever afterwards to eradicate it. Indeed that the scheme of Babel, whatever it was, could have been put into execution by man, seems evident from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERPOLATION\">interpolation</a> of the Deity <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the occasion; for we cannot suppose that he would have worked a miracle on purpose to defeat that which would have defeated itself if he had let it alone; and he expressly says, That now nothing could be restrained from them; which intimates very plainly, that, had this scheme gone on, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> which God had laid for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the world would have been totally frustrated: and agreeable to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> Dr Tenison supposes that the tower was of a pyramidal form, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the spires of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>; and that it was erected in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the sun, as being the most probable cause of drying up the flood.\n\nAs to the materials made use of in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of this tower, the Scripture informs us that they were bricks and lime or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BITUMEN\">bitumen</a>. According to an eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>, three years were taken up in making the bricks, each of which was 13 cubits <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, 10 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and five thick. Oriental writers say, that the city was 373 fathoms in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, and 151 in breadth; that the walls were 5533 fathoms high, and 33 in breadth; and that the tower itself was no less than 10,000 fathoms, or 12 miles high. Even St Jerome affirms from the testimony of eye-witnesses, who as he says had examined the remains of the tower, that it was four miles high; but Ado makes the height to have been no less than 5000 miles. The only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of its dimensions which can be at all depended upon (supposing it to have been the same which afterwards stood in the midst of the city of Babylon, and round which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol16.html#article-NEBUCHADNEZZAR\">Nebuchadnezzar</a> built the temple of Belus), is that given under the article BABYLON.","sp":346,"ep":347},{"h":"BAETERRAE","t":"an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> town of the Tertofages in Gallia Narbonensis; now Belfort, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of the Obris, now Orbis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Orbe, in Lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol9.html#article-LANGUEDOC\">Languedoc</a>.","sp":368,"ep":368},{"h":"BAETICA","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, so called from the famed river Baetis, afterwards Tartessus, now Guadalquivir, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> river.

On the one side of which, towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANAS\">Anas</a>, were situated the Turdetani, from whence the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> was called Turdetania, though more generally known by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Baeturia. On the other side were situated the Baetuli, Baetetani, and Contentani, along the Mediterranean coasts. The Baetuli were supposed to be of Phoenician extract, and dwelt along the coasts of the Mediterranean, till, driven from thence by the Moors, they fled into the mountainous parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GALICIA\">Galicia</a>, which they then called from their own name Baetulia. The Baetetani were seated higher up, on the same coasts.

The bass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DRONE\">drone</a>, and the tenor or treble part the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHANTER\">chanter</a>. In all the species, the bass never varies from its uniform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, and therefore very deservedly gets the name of drone; and the compass of the chanter is likewise very limited. There is a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the Highland and Lowland bag-pipes of Scotland; the former being blown with the mouth, and the latter with a small bellows; though this difference is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a>, every species of bag-pipes being capable, by a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of the reeds, of producing music either with the mouth or bellows. The following are the species of bag-pipes most commonly known in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>.\n\n1. The Irish Pipe. This is the softest, and in some respects the most melodious of any, so that music-books have been published with directions how to play <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> it. The chanter, like that of all the rest, has eight holes like the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLUTE\">flute</a>, and is played on by opening and shutting the holes as occasion requires; the bass consists of two short drones and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> one. The lowest note of the chanter is D on the German flute, being the open note on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a>-string of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIOLIN\">violin</a>; the small drone (one of them commonly being stopped up) is tuned in unison with the note above this, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> one to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OCTAVE\">octave</a> below; so that a bag-pipe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> is required in order to produce such a low note, on which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> the drone hath sometimes two or three turns. The instrument is tuned by lengthening or shortening the drone till it finds the note desired.\n\n2. The Highland Bag-Pipe. This consists of a chanter and two short drones, which found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> the lowest note of the chanter except one. This is exceedingly loud, and almost deafening if played in a room; and is therefore mostly used in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>, for marches, &c. It requires a prodigious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BLAST\">blast</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> it; so that those unaccustomed to it cannot imagine how Highland pipers can continue to play for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> together, as they are often known to do. For the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, those who use the instrument are obliged either to stand on their feet or walk when they play. This instrument hath but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> notes; its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>, however, hath not yet been reduced to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> standard by comparing it with that of other instruments, so that we can say nothing about its compass. Those who are best acquainted with it, however, affirm that it plays only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> notes, without being capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> by flats or sharps.\n\n3. The Scots Lowland Pipe. This is likewise a very loud instrument, though less so than the former. It is blown with bellows, and hath a bass like the Irish pipe. This species is different from all the rest, as it cannot play the natural notes, but hath F and C sharp. The lowest note of a good bag-pipe of this kind is unison with C sharp on the tenor of a violin tuned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a>-pitch; and, as it hath but nine notes, the highest is D in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol2.html#article-ALT\">alt</a>. From this peculiar construction, the Highland and Lowland bag-pipes play two species of music essentially different from one another, as each of them also is from every other species of music in the world. Hence these two species of bag-pipes deserve notice as curiosities; for the music which they play is accompanied with such peculiar ornaments, or what are intended as such, as neither violin, or even organ, can imitate, but in a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> manner.\n\nThis kind of bag-pipe was formerly very much used in Scotland at weddings and other festivals; being indeed extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> calculated for playing that peculiar species of Scots music called reels. It has been often a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of surprize how this was possible, as the instrument has only a compass of nine or ten notes at the utmost, and which cannot be varied as in other instruments. In this respect, however, it has a very great compass, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> play an inconceivable variety of tunes. As its notes are naturally so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, there is scarce any one tune but what is naturally transposed by it, so that what would be a flat note on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KEY\">key</a> proper for the violin, may be a sharp one on the bag-pipe; and though the latter cannot play any flat note, it may nevertheless in this manner play tunes which on other instruments would be flat, to as great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> as these instruments themselves.\n\n4. The Small Pipe. This is remarkable for its smallness, the chanter not exceeding eight inches in length; for which reason, the holes are so near each other, that it is with difficulty they can be closed. This hath only eight notes, the lower end of the chanter being commonly stopped. The reason of this is, to prevent the flurring of all the notes, which is unavoidable in the other\nother species; so that in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of a bad player they become the most shocking and unintelligible instruments imaginable: but this, by having the lower hole closed, and also by the peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> in which the notes are expressed, plays all its tunes in the way called by the Italians flaccato, and cannot flur at all. It hath no species of music peculiar to itself; and can play nothing which cannot be much better done upon other instruments; though it is surprising what volatility some performers on this instrument will display, and how much they will overcome the natural disadvantages of it. Some of this species, instead of having drones like the others, have their bass parts consisting of a winding cavity in a kind of short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, and are tuned by opening them to a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> by means of sliding covers; from which contrivance they are called flute-pipes. Besides these there are a variety of others, called Italian, German, Organ, &c., bag-pipes, which have nothing different in their construction from those above described, nor any good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> to recommend them.\n\nAs to the origin of bag-pipe music, some are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that it is to be derived from the Danes; but Mr Pennant thinks differently, and gives the following reasons for deriving it from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>.\n\nNeither of these instruments (the Highland and Lowland bag-pipes above described) were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of the Danes, or, as is commonly supposed, of any of the northern nations; for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> writers prove them to have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a> by the clangor tubarum. Notwithstanding they have had their feck pipe long amongst them, as their old songs prove, yet we cannot allow them the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of inventing this melodious instrument, but must assert, that they borrowed it from the invaded Caledonians. We must still go farther, and derive even that ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>; and derive its origin from the mild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> of Italy, perhaps from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>.\n\nThere is now in Rome a most beautiful bas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIEVO\">relievo</a>, a Grecian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a> of the highest antiquity, of a bag-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIPER\">piper</a> playing on his instrument, exactly like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> Highlander. The Greeks had their A\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, or instrument, composed of a pipe and blown-up skin: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> borrowed it from them, and introduced it among their swains, who still use it under the names of piva and cornu-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSA\">musa</a>.\n\nThat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of music, Nero, used one; and had not the empire been so suddenly deprived of that great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol3.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>, he would (as he graciously declared his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a>) have treated the people with a concert, and among other curious instruments, would have introduced the utricularius or bag-pipe. Nero perished; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of the instrument is preserved on one of his coins, but highly improved by that great master: it has the bag and two of the vulgar pipes; but was blown with a bellows like an organ, and had on one side a row of nine unequal pipes, resembling the syrinx of the god <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAN\">Pan</a>. The bag-pipe, in the unimproved state, is also represented in an ancient sculpture; and appears to have had two long pipes or drones, and a single short pipe for the fingers. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">Tradition</a> says, that the kind played on by the mouth was introduced by the Danes; as theirs was wind-music, we will admit that they might have made improvement, but more we cannot allow: they were skilled in the use of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRUMPET\">trumpet</a>; the Highlanders in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIBROCH\">pibroch</a>, or bag-pipe.\n\nNon tuba in usu illis, conjuncta at tibia in utrem Dat belli signum, et martem vocat horrida in arma.* * Melvini Topogr. Scot.\n\nThe bag-pipe appears to have been an instrument of great antiquity in Ireland, though it is uncertain whence they derived it. Mr Pennant, by means of an antique found at Richborough in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a>, has determined that the bag-pipe was introduced at a very early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>; whence it is probable that both Irish and Danes might borrow the instrument from the Caledonians with whom they had such frequent intercourse. Arithides Quintilianus informs us, that it prevailed in the highlands in very early ages; and indeed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of the people seems to render the opinion highly probable. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> of that people to their music called pibrachs is almost incredible, and on some occasions is said to have produced effects little less marvellous than those ascribed to the ancient music. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Quebec in 1760, while the British troops were retreating in great disorder, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> complained to a field officer in Frazer's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGIMENT\">regiment</a> of the bad behaviour of his corps. \"Sir (said he with some warmth), you did very wrong in forbidding the pipers to play this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>: nothing encourages the Highlanders so much in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. Nay, even now they would be of use.\"\u2014\"Let them blow like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a>, then (replies the general), if it will bring back the men.\" The pipers were then ordered to play a favourite martial air; and the Highlanders, the moment they heard the music, returned and formed with alacrity in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REAR\">rear</a>. In the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, Sir Eyre Coote, aware of the attachment of the Highlanders to their favourite instrument, gave them 50l. to buy a pair of bag-pipes after the battle of Porto Nuovo.\n\nFormerly there was a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SKYE\">Skye</a>, where the highland bag-pipe was taught; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEACHERS\">teachers</a> making use of pins stuck into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> instead of musical notes. This college, however, has been for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> entirely dissolved, and the use of the Highland pipe became much less general than before. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of gentlemen, thinking it perhaps impolitic to allow the ancient martial music of the country to decline, resolved to revive it by giving an annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> to the best performers on the instrument. These competitions were first held at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALKIRK\">Falkirk</a>, but for a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of years at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>; where the only surviving member of the ancient college of Skye is now professor of bag-pipe music.\n\nThe Lowland pipe, as has been already observed, is an instrument essentially different from the Highland pipe; it was reformed, and the music improved by George Mackie, who is said to have attended the college of Skye seven years. He had before been the best performer on that instrument in that part of the country where he lived; but, while attending the college at Skye, he adapted the graces of the Highland music to the Lowland pipe. Upon his return, he was heard with astonishment and admiration; but unluckily, not being able to commit his improvements to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, and indeed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the instrument scarcely admitting of it, the knowledge of this kind of music hath <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to decay ever since, and will probably soon wear out altogether.

See Arabia, No. 184.\n\nThe reasons assigned by the Arabian historians for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> the city of Bagdad are, That the above-mentioned attempt to assassinate the caliph had disgusted him at his Arabian subjects in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, and that the spot where Bagdad stood was at a considerable distance from the city of Cufa particularly; the inhabitants of which were remarkable for their treachery and inconstancy, Al Mansur himself having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> several instances of it. Besides the people of Irac, who had always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> faithful to him, represented, that by building his capital near the confluence of the Euphrates and Tigris, it would be in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> secured from the insults and attacks of those who should have an inclination to dispute the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALIPHATE\">caliphate</a> with him; and that by being situated as it were in the middle of the tract comprehending the districts of Bafrah, Cufa, Walet, Mawfel, and Swada, at no great distance from these cities, it would be plentifully supplied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> by means of the aforesaid rivers.\n\nConcerning the origin of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> Bagdad, there are various accounts, which, being equally uncertain and trifling, merit no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. The first city that went by this name was situated on the western <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of the Tigris; from whence Al Mansur despatched his son Al Mohdi with a body of Mollem troops to the opposite bank. Here the young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a>, and fortified the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> on which he had encamped with a wall, in order to cover his troops, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the workmen employed by his father on the other side of the river, from the incursions of the Persians, who seemed to have taken umbrage at the erection of a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> so near the frontiers of their dominions. Hence that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the city soon after built on the eastern banks of the Tigris, received the name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">Camp</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Fortresses of Al Mohdi. The caliph had a superb and magnificent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> both in the eastern and western part of the town. The eastern palace was surrounded on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a> side by a semicircular wall that had six gates; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> of which seems to have been called the gate of prefects, whose entrance was generally kissed by the princes and ambassadors that came to the caliph's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>. The western part of the city was entirely round, with the caliph's palace in the centre, and having the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSQUE\">mosque</a> annexed to it. The eastern part consisted of an interior and exterior town, each of which was surrounded by a wall. For some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the building of the city went but slowly on, owing to a scarcity of materials for building; for which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> the caliph was sometimes inclined to remove the materials of Al Madayen, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> metropolis of the Persian empire. But, upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, he found the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> to be of such immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, that the removal of them to Bagdad would be attended with great difficulty and expense; besides, he considered that it would be a reflection upon himself to have it said that he could not finish his metropolis without destroying such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILE\">pile</a> of building as perhaps could not be paralleled in the whole world; for which reasons he at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> gave over his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, and erected the city of Bagdad most probably out of the ruins of the ancient cities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SELEUCIA\">Seleucia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CTESIPHON\">Ctesiphon</a>, putting an end to his undertaking in the 149th year of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEGIRA\">Hegira</a>, or four years after the city was begun.\n\nFrom the building of the city of Bagdad to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Al Mansur nothing very remarkable happened, excepting some irruptions made into the territories of the Greeks, and by the Arabs into some of the caliph's other territories. In the 157th year of the Hegira also, a grievous famine was felt in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MESOPOTAMIA\">Mesopotamia</a>, which was quickly after followed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> that destroyed great numbers. This year likewise, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, who had been all along very severely dealt with by Al Mansur, were treated with the utmost rigour by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSA\">Musa</a> Ebn Moaafab the caliph's governor; every one who was unable to pay the enormous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUTE\">tribute</a> exacted of them being thrown into prison without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>.\n\nThe next year, being the 158th of the Hegira, the death of Al Mansur set out from Bagdad, in order to perform the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILGRIMAGE\">pilgrimage</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MECCA\">Mecca</a>; but being taken ill on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, he expired at Bir Maimun, whence his body was carried to Mecca; where, after a hundred graves had been dug, that his sepulchre might be concealed, he was interred, having lived according to some 63, according to others 68 years, and reigned 22. He is said to have been extremely covetous, and to have left in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a> 600,000,000 dirhems, and 24,000,000 dinars. He is reported to have paid his cook by afflicting him the heads and legs of the animals drest in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a>, and to have obliged him to procure at his own expense all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> and vessels he had occasion for.\n\nWhen Al Mansur expired at Bir Maimun, he had succeeded only his domestics and Rabi his freedman with him, by Al Mohdi. The latter of these, for some time, kept his death concealed, and pretended to have a conference with him, in which, as he gave out, the caliph commanded him to exact an oath of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> to Al Mohdi his son, as his immediate successor, and to Isa Ebn Musa his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a>-german, as the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>. He then despatched a courier to Bagdad with the news of Al Mansur's death; upon which Al Mohdi was unanimously proclaimed caliph. Isa Ebn Musa, however, no sooner heard this news, than he began to entertain thoughts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> up for himself at Cufa, where he then resided; and in order to facilitate the execution of his scheme, fortified himself in that city. But Al Mohdi being apprised of his defection, sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> of 1000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> to bring him to Bagdad; which being done, Al Mohdi not only prevailed upon him to own his allegiance to him, but also to give up his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to the succession for 10,000 according to some, or according to others for 10,000,000 dinars.\n\nFrom the accession of Al Mohdi to the 146th year of the Hegira, the most remarkable event was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REBELLION\">rebellion</a> of Al Mokanna. This impious impostor, whose true name was Hakem Ebn Heyham, came originally from Khorasan, and had been an under secretary to Abu Mollem governor of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>. He afterwards turned soldier, and passed thence into Mawarannah, where he gave himself out for a prophet. The name of Al Mokanna, as also that of Al Borkai, that is, the veiled, he took from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of covering his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a> with a veil or girdle mask, to conceal his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFORMITY\">deformity</a>; he having lost an eye in the wars, and being otherwise...\notherwise of a despicable appearance; though his followers pretended he did this for the same reason that Moles did, viz. left the splendour of his countenance should dazzle the eyes of his beholders. In some places he made a great many profelytes, deluding the people with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of juggling tricks which they swallowed as miracles, and particularly by causing the appearance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> to rise out of a well for many nights together; whence he was also called in the Persian tongue, Sazendeb mak, or the moon-maker. This wretch, not content with being reckoned a prophet, arrogated to himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> honours; pretending that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a> resided in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>, having proceeded to him from Abu Mollem, in whom he had taken up his residence before. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> this impostor raised an open rebellion against the caliph, and made himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of several fortified places in Khurasan, so that Al Mohdi was obliged to send one of his generals with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> against him. Upon the approach of the caliph's troops, Al Mokamma retired into one of his strong fortresses which he had well provided for a siege; and sent his emissaries abroad to persuade the people that he raised the dead to life, and foretold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> events. But being closely besieged by the caliph's forces, and seeing no possibility of escaping, he gave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> in wine to his whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> and all that were with him, in the castle; when they were dead, he burnt their bodies, together with all their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a>, provisions, and cattle; and lastly, he threw himself into the flames, or, as others say, into a tub of aquafortis, or some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>, which consumed every part of him except the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>. When the besiegers therefore entered the place, they found no living creature in it, except one of Al Mokanna's concubines, who, suspecting his design, had hid herself, and now discovered the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>. This terrible contrivance, however, failed not to produce the desired effect. He had promised his followers, that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> should transmigrate into the form of an old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> riding on a greyhul coloured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a>, and that after so many years he would return and give them the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> for their possession; which ridiculous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> kept the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> in being for several years.\n\nAll this time <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> had been carried on with the Greeks, but without any remarkable success on either side. In the 164th year of the Hegira, however, Al Mohdi ordered his son Harun Al Rafchid to penetrate into the Greek territories with an army of 95,000 men. Harun, then, having entered the dominions of the empress <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRENE\">Irene</a>, defeated one of her commanders that advanced against him; after which he laid waste several of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">imperial</a> provinces with fire and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, and even threatened the city of Constantinople itself. By this the empress was so terrified, that she purchased a peace with the caliph by paying him an annual tribute of 70,000 pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>; which, for the present at least, delivered her from the depredations of these barbarians. After the signing of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a>, Harun returned home <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with spoils and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>. This year, according to some of the oriental historians, the sun one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, a little after his rising, totally lost his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> in a moment, without being eclipsed, when neither any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOG\">fog</a> nor any cloud of dust appeared to obscure him. This frightful darkness continued till noon, to the great astonishment of the people settled in the countries where it happened.\n\nIn the 166th year of the Hegira, Al Mohdi was poisoned, though undefendedly, by one of his concubines named Hafanab. She had designed to destroy him; one of her rivals whom she imagined to have too great an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASCENDANT\">ascendant</a> over the caliph by giving her a poisoned pear. This the latter, not suspecting anything, gave to the caliph; who had no sooner eaten it than he felt himself in exquisite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORTURE\">torture</a>, and soon after expired.\n\nOn the death of Al Mohdi, he was succeeded by his eldest son Al Hadi; who having formed a design to succeed, deprived his younger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Harun Al Rafchid of his right of succession, and even to affiancement him, was poisoned by his vizier in the 17th year of the Hegira; and on his death the celebrated caliph Harun Al Rafchid ascended the throne.\n\nThis was one of the best and wisest princes that Harun Al Rafchid ever sat on the throne of Bagdad. He was also extremely fortunate in all his undertakings, though he did not much extend his dominions by conquest. In his time the Mollem empire may be said to have been in its most flourishing state, though by the independency of the Mollems in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, who had formerly set up a caliph of the house of Omniyah, his territories were not quite so extensive as those of some of his predecessors. He possessed the provinces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a>, Arabia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMENIA\">Armenia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATOLIA\">Natolia</a>, Media or Adurbijan, Babylon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSYRIA\">Assyria</a>, Sindia, Sijiljan, Khorasan, Tabristan, Jorjan, Zablestan or Sablestan, Mawaralnahr or Great Bukharia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBYA\">Libya</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAURITANIA\">Mauritania</a>, &c.; so that his empire was by far the most powerful of any in the world, and extended farther than the Roman empire ever had done.\n\nThe first influence of Harun's good fortune, and which was taken for a preface of a prosperous and happy reign, was his finding a valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a> which he had thrown into the Tigris to avoid being deprived of it by his brother Al Hadi. He was able to give the divers no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> than by throwing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> of Bagdad, about the same place of the river in which he had thrown the ring; notwithstanding which, they found it without any great difficulty.\n\nIn the 186th year of the Hegira, beginning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 802, the caliph divided the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> among his three sons, in the following manner: To Al Amin the eldest, he assigned the provinces of Syria, Irak, the three Arabias, Mesopotamia, Assyria, Media, Palestine, Egypt, and all that part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a> extending from the confines of Egypt and Ethiopia to the straits of Gibraltar, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of caliph; to Al Mamun the second, he assigned Persia, Kerman, the Indies, Khorasan, Tabristan, Calestan, and Zablestan, together with the vast province of Mawaralnahr; and to this third son Al Kalem, he gave Armenia, Natolia, Jorjan, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEORGIA\">Georgia</a>, Circassia, and all the Mollem territories bordering upon the Euxine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. As to the order of succession, Al Amin was to ascend the throne immediately after his father's decease; after him, Al Mamun; and then Al Kafem, whom he had nicknamed Al Mutaman.\n\nThe most considerable exploit performed by this caliph\ncaliph were against the Greeks, who by their perfidy provoked him to make war upon them, and whom he always overcame. In the 18th year of the Hegira, the caliph received a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> from the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Nicephorus soon after he had been advanced to the imperial dignity, commanding him to return all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> he had extorted from the empress Irene, though that had been secured to him by the last treaty concluded with that princess, or expect soon to see an imperial army in the heart of his territories. This insolent letter so exasperated Harun, that he immediately assembled his forces and advanced to Heraclia, laying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> through which he passed waste with fire and sword. For some time also he kept that city straitly besieged; which so terrified the Greek emperor, that he submitted to pay an annual tribute. Upon this Harun granted him a peace, and returned with his army. But a hard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FROST\">frost</a> soon after happening in these parts, Nicephorus took for granted that Al-Rafid would not pay him another visit, and therefore broke the treaty he had concluded. Of this the caliph receiving advice, he instantly put himself in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>; and, notwithstanding the inclemency of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, forced the emperor to accept of the terms proposed. According to a Persian historian, before the hostilities at this time commenced, Nicephorus made the caliph a present of several fine swords, giving him thereby plainly to understand that he was more inclinable to come to blows than to make peace with him. All these swords Harun cut asunder with his famous sword Samiramah, as if they had been so many radishes, after which severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> there did not appear the least flaw in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLADE\">blade</a>; a clear proof of the goodness of the sword, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> the others with it was of the strength of Harun's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a>. This sword had fallen into Al-Rafid's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> among the spoils of Ebn Dakikan, one of the last Hamaritic princes of Yaman; but is said to have belonged originally to a valiant Arab named Amru Ebn Maadi Karb, by whose name it generally went among the Molems. This man is said to have performed very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> feats with his sword, which induced a certain prince to borrow it from him; but not being able to perform any thing remarkable with it, complained to Amru that it had not the desired effect; upon which that brave man took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to tell him, that he had not sent him his arm along with his sword.\n\nIn the 18th year of the Hegira, war was renewed with the Greeks, and Nicephorus with a great army attacked the caliph's forces with the utmost fury. He was, however, defeated with the loss of 40,000 men, and received three wounds in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>; after which the Molems committed terrible ravages in his territories, and returned home laden with spoils. The next year Harun invaded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHRYGIA\">Phrygia</a>; defeated an imperial army sent to oppose him; and having ravaged the country, returned without any considerable loss. In the 19th year of the Hegira, commencing November 27, 805, the caliph marched into the imperial territories with an army of 135,000 men, besides a great number of volunteers and others who were not enrolled among his troops. He first took the city of Heraclia, from whence he is said to have carried 16,000 prisoners; after which he made himself master of several other places; and in the conclusion of the expedition, he made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Cyprus, which he plundered in a terrible manner. This success so intimidated Nicephorus, that he immediately sent the tribute due to Harun, the withholding of which had been the cause of the war, and concluded a peace upon the caliph's own terms; one of which was, that the city of Heraclia should never be rebuilt. This perhaps Harun would not have so readily granted, had not one Rebellion Rafe Ebn Al <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LEITH\">Leith</a> revolted against him at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMARCAND\">Samarcand</a>, in Khora, and assembled a considerable force to support him in his defection.\n\nThe next year being the 19th of the Hegira, the caliph removed the governor of Khorsan from his employment, because he had not been sufficiently attentive to the motions of the rebel Rafe Ebn Al Leith. As this governor had also tyrannized over his subjects in the most cruel manner, his successor no sooner arrived than he sent him in chains to the caliph; but notwithstanding all Harun's care, the rebels made this year a great progress in the conquest of Khorasan.\n\nNext year the caliph found it necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> in person against the rebels, who were daily becoming more formidable. The general rendezvous of his troops was in the plains of Rakka, from whence he advanced at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of them to Bagdad. Having at that place supplied the troops with everything necessary, he continued his march to the frontiers of Jorjan, where he was seized with an illness which grew more violent after he had entered that province. Finding himself therefore unable to pursue his journey, he resigned the command of the army to his son Al Mamun, retiring himself to Tus in Khorsan. We are told by Khondemir, that, before the caliph departed from Rakka, he had a dream, wherein he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> over his head full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> earth, and at the same time heard a person pronouncing these words, \"See the earth where Harun is to be buried.\" Upon this he demanded where he was to be buried; and was instantly answered, \"At Tus.\" This dream greatly discomposing him, he communicated it to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> physician, who endeavoured to divert him, telling the caliph that the dream had been occasioned by the thoughts of his expedition against the rebels. He therefore advised him to pursue some favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVERSION\">diversion</a> that might draw his attention another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>. The caliph accordingly, by his physician's advice, prepared a magnificent regale for his courtiers, which lasted several days. After this, he put himself at the head of his forces, and advanced to the confines of Jorjan, where he was attacked by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTEMPER\">distemper</a> that proved fatal to him. As his disorder increased, he found himself obliged to retire to Tus; where being arrived, he sent for his physician, and said to him, \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GABRIEL\">Gabriel</a>, do you remember my dream at Rakka? we are now arrived at Tus, the place, according to what was predicted in that dream, of my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERMENT\">interment</a>. Send one of my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EUNUCHS\">eunuchs</a> to fetch me a handful of earth in the neighbourhood of this city.\" Upon this, Mafur, one of his favourite eunuchs, was despatched to bring a little of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> of the place to the caliph. He soon returned and brought a handful of red earth, which he presented to the caliph with his arm half bare. At the sight of this Harun instantly cried out, \"In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> this is the earth, and this the very spot, that I saw in my dream. His spirits immediately failing, and his malady being greatly increased by the perturbation of mind ensuing upon\nBagdad, upon this fight, he died three days after, and was buried in the same place. According to Abul Faraj, Bahr Ebn Al Leith the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a>-rebel's brother was brought in chains to the caliph, who was then at the point of death. At the fight of whom Harun declared, that if he could speak only two words he would say kill him; and immediately ordered him to be cut to pieces in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a>. This being done, the caliph soon after expired, in the year of the Hegira 193, having reigned 23 years. The distemper that put an end to his days is said to have been the bloody-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a>.\n\nUpon the arrival of a courier from Tus, with the news of Al Rafhid's death, his son Al Amin was immediately proclaimed caliph; and was no sooner seated on the throne, than he formed a design of excluding his brother Al Mamun from the succession. Accordingly he deprived him of the furniture of the imperial palace of Khorasan; and in open violation of his father's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, who had bestowed on Al Mamun the perpetual government of Khorasan, and of all the troops in that province, he ordered these forces to march directly to Bagdad. Upon the arrival of this order, Al Mamun expostulated with the general Al Fadl Ebn Rabbi who commanded his troops, and endeavoured to prevent his marching to Bagdad; but without effect, for he punctually obeyed the orders sent by the caliph. Al Mamun, however, took care not to be wanting in fidelity to his brother. He obliged the people of Khorasan to take an oath of fidelity to Al Amin, and reduced some who had actually excited a considerable body of the people to revolt, while the general Al Fadl having ingratiated himself with the caliph by his ready compliance with his orders, was chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a> vizir, and governed with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> sway: Al Amin abandoning himself entirely to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRUNKENNESS\">drunkenness</a>.\n\nAl Fadl was a very able minister; though fearing Al Mamun's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a> if ever he should ascend the throne, he gave Al Amin such advice as proved in the end the ruin of them both. He told him that his brother had gained the affection of the people of Khorasan by the good order and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a> he had established among them; that his unwearied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> had so attracted their esteem, that the whole province was entirely at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>; that his own conduct was by no means relished by his subjects, whose minds were almost totally alienated from him; and therefore that he had but one part to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, which was to deprive Al Mamun of the right of succession that had been given him by his father, and transfer it to his own son Mufa, though then but an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a>. Agreeable to this pernicious advice, the caliph sent for his brother Al Kasem from Mesopotamia, and recalled Al Mamun from Khorasan, pretending he had occasion for him as an assistant in his councils.\n\nBy this treatment Al Mamun was so much provoked, that he resolved to come to an open rupture with his brother, in order if possible to frustrate his wicked designs. Instead, therefore, of going to Bagdad as he had been commanded, he cut off all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> between his own province and that capital: pretending, that as his father Harun had assigned him the lieutenancy of Khorasan, he was responsible for all the disorders that might happen there during his absence. He also coined money, and would not suffer Al Amin's name to be impressed upon any of the dirhems or dinars struck in that province. Not content with this, he prevailed upon Rafe Ebn Al Leith, who had been for some time in rebellion, to join him with a body of troops; whose example was soon after followed by Harthema Ebn Aafan; which put him in possession of all the vast territory of Khorasan. Here he governed with an absolute sway, officiated in the mosque as Imam, and from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULPIT\">pulpit</a> constantly harangued the people.\n\nThe following year, being the 19th year of the Hegira, beginning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a> 4, 810, the caliph Al-Amin, finding that his brother set him at defiance, declared war against him, and sent his general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALI\">Ali</a> Ebn Ishaq with an army of 60,000 men to invade Khorasan. Al Mamun, being informed that Ali was advancing against him with such a powerful army, put on foot forces of all the troops he could raise, and gave the command to Thaher Ebn Hoefin, one of the greatest generals of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. Thaher being a man of undaunted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>, chose only 4000 men whom he led against Al Amin's army. Ali, seeing so small a number of troops advancing against him, was transported with joy, and promised himself an easy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a>. Defying his enemies, therefore, he behaved in a secure and careless manner; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which was, that his army was entirely defeated, and himself killed, his head being afterwards sent as a present to Al Mamun, who amply rewarded Thaher and Harthema for their services.\n\nAfter this victory, Al Mamun assumed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of caliph, ordered Al Amin's name to be omitted in the public prayers, and made all necessary preparations for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> the war into the very heart of his brother's dominions. For this purpose he divided his forces into two bodies, and commanded them to march into Irak by different routes. One of them obeyed the orders of Thaher, and the other of Harthema. The first directed his march towards Ahwas, and the other towards Holwan, both of them proposing to meet in the neighbourhood of Bagdad, and after their junction to besiege that city.\n\nIn the 196th year of the Hegira, Thaher Ebn Hoefin made a most rapid progress with the troops under his command. Having advanced towards Ahwas, he there defeated a body of the caliph's forces; and though the victory was by no means decisive, it intimidated the commander of Ahwas, that he thought fit to surrender that fortress to him. This opened him a way to Wafet upon the Tigris, and facilitated the conquest of that place. After this he marched with his army to Al Madayen; the inhabitants of which immediately opened their gates to him. The rapidity of these conquests, and the infamous conduct of Al Amin, excited the people of Egypt, Syria, Hejaz, and Yaman, unanimously to declare for Al Mamun; who was accordingly proclaimed caliph in all the provinces.\n\nThe next year, Al Mamun's forces under Thaher laid siege of and Harthema, laid siege to Bagdad. As the caliph was shut up in that place, and it had a numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARRISON\">garrison</a>, the besieged made a vigorous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, and destroyed a great number of their enemies. The besiegers, however, incessantly played upon the town with their catapults and other engines, though they were in their turn not a little annoyed by the garrison with the same sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> machines. The latter likewise made continual\ncontinual fallies, and fought like men in despair, though they were always at last beaten back into the town with considerable loss. In short the siege continued during the whole of this year, in which the greatest part of the eastern city, called the Camp of Al Mohdi, was demolished or reduced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a>. The citizens, as well as the garrison, were reduced to the last extremity, by the length and violence of the siege.\n\nIn the beginning of the 108th year of the Hegira, Al Amin finding himself deserted by his troops, as well as by the principal men of Bagdad, who had kept a private correspondence with Thaher, was obliged to retire to the old town on the west bank of the Tigris. He did not, however, take this step, before the inhabitants of the new town had formally depopulated him, and proclaimed his brother Al Mamun caliph. Thaher, receiving advice of this, caused the old town to be immediately invested, planted his engines against it, and at last starved it to surrender. Al Amin being thus reduced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of putting himself into the hands of one of the generals, chose to implore the protection of Harthema, whom he judged to be of a more humane disposition than Thaher. Having obtained this, he embarked in a small vessel in order to arrive at that part of the camp where Harthema was posted; but Thaher being informed of his design, which, if put in execution, he thought would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECLIPSE\">eclipse</a> the glory he had acquired, laid an ambush for him, which he had not the good fortune to escape. Upon his arrival in the neighbourhood of Harthema's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-TENT\">tent</a>, Thaher's soldiers rushed upon him, drowned all his attendants, and put himself in prison. Here he was soon after massacred by Thaher's servants, who carried his head in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a> to their master, by whose order it was afterwards exposed to public view in the streets of Bagdad. Thaher afterwards sent to Al Mamun in Khorasan, together with the ring or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a> of the caliphate, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCEPTRE\">sceptre</a>, and the imperial robe. At the theft of these, Al Mamun fell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> on his knees, and returned thanks to God for his success; making the courier who brought them a present of a million of dirhems, in value about 100,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>.\n\nThe same day that Al Amin was assassinated, his brother Al Mamun was proclaimed caliph at Bagdad. He had not long been seated on the throne when he was alarmed by rebellions breaking out in different parts of the empire. These, however, were at last happily extinguished; after which, Thaher Ebn Hofein had the government of Khorasan conferred upon him and his descendants with almost absolute and unlimited power. This happened in the 25th year of the Hegira, from which time we may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> the dismemberment of that province from the empire of the caliphs.\n\nDuring the reign of this caliph nothing remarkable happened; only the African Molems invaded the island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, where they made themselves masters of several places. He died of a surfeit in the 28th year of the Hegira, having reigned 20, and lived 43 or 49 years.\n\nOn the death of Al Mamun, his brother Al Motafsem, by some of the oriental historians named Billah, was saluted caliph. He succeeded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of Al Mamun's express nomination of him to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of his own son Al Abbas and his other brother Al Kafein, who had been appointed by Harun Al Raschid. In the beginning of his reign he was obliged to employ the whole forces of his empire against one Babec, who had been for a considerable time in rebellion in Persia and Perisan Irak. This Babec first appeared in the year of the Hegira 201, when he began to take upon new caliph him the title of a prophet. What his particular doctrine and name was, is now unknown; but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> is said to have differed from all others then known in Alfa. He gained a great number of proficients in Aderbijan and the Persian Irak, where he soon grew powerful enough to wage war with the caliph Al Mamun, whose troops he often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a>, so that he was now become extremely formidable. The general sent by Al Motafsem to reduce him was Haider Ebn Kaus, surnamed Afshin, a Turk by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, who had been brought a slave to the caliph's court, and having been employed in disciplining the Turkish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a> there, had acquired the reputation of a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>. By him Babec was defeated with prodigious slaughter, no fewer than 60,000 men Babec being killed in the first engagement. The next year, being the 220th of the Hegira, he received a still greater overthrow, losing 100,000 men either killed or taken prisoners. By this defeat he was obliged to retire into the Gordyean mountains; where he fortified himself in such a manner, that Afshin found it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to reduce him till the year of the Hegira 222. This commander having reduced with invincible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> all Babec's castles one after another, the impostor was obliged to shut himself up in a strong fortress called Ca'abad, which was now his last resource. Here he defended himself with great bravery for several months; but at last finding he should be obliged to surrender, he made his escape into a neighbouring wood, from whence he soon after came to Afshin, upon that general's promising him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a>. But Afshin no sooner had him in his power, than he first caused his finger and hands and feet, and afterwards his head, to be cut off; put to death. Babec had supported himself against the power of the caliphs for upwards of 20 years, during which time he had cruelly massacred 250,000 people; it being his He destroy custom to spare neither man, woman, nor child, of the evil Mahometans or their allies. Amongst the prisoners numbers of taken at Ca'abad there was one Nad, who had been one of Babec's executioners, and who owned that in obedience to his master's commands he had destroyed 20,000 Molems with his own hands; to which he added, that vast numbers had also been executed by his companions, but that of these he could give no precise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>.\n\nIn the 223rd year of the Hegira, the Greek emperor Theophilus invaded the caliph's territories, where he behaved with the greatest cruelty, and by destroying Sozopetra the place of Al Motafsem's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATIVITY\">nativity</a>, notwithstanding his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> entreaties to the contrary, occasioned the terrible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of Amorium mentioned under that article. The rest of this caliph's reign is remarkable for nothing but the execution of Afshin, who was accused of holding correspondence with the caliph's enemies. After his death a great number of idols were found in his house, which were immediately burned, as also several books said to contain impious and detestable opinions.\n\nIn the 227th year of the Hegira died the caliph Al Death of Motafsem, in the 48th or 49th year of his age. He Al Motafsem reigned eight years eight months and eight days, was born\nBaghdad, born in the eighth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of the year, fought eight battles, had 800 slaves, and had 8,000,000 dinars and 80,000 dirhems in his treasury at his death, whence the oriental historians give him the name of Al Motbammen, or the Generous. He is said to have been robust, that he once carried a burden of 1000 pounds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> several paces. As the people of Baghdad disturbed him with frequent revolts and commotions, he took the resolution to abandon that city, and build another for his own residence. The new city he built was first called Samarra, and afterwards Sarra Manray, and stood in the Arabian Irak. He was attached to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of the Motaizites, who maintain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> of the Koran; and both he and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREDECESSOR\">predecessor</a> cruelly persecuted those who believed it to be eternal.\n\nAl Motalem was succeeded by Al Wathek Bilah, who the following year, being the 228th of the Hegira, invaded and conquered Sicily. Nothing remarkable happened during the rest of his reign; he died in the 232nd year of the Hegira, and was succeeded by his brother Al Motawakkil.\n\nThe new caliph began his reign with an act of the greatest cruelty. The late caliph's vizir having treated Al Motawakkil ill in his brother's lifetime, and opposed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> to the caliphate, was on that account now sent to prison. Here the caliph ordered him to be kept awake for several days and nights together; after this, being suffered to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> asleep, he slept a whole day and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>; and after he awoke was thrown into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a> lined with spikes or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAILS\">nails</a> heated red hot, where he was miserably burnt to death. During this reign nothing remarkable happened, except wars with the Greeks, which were carried on with various success. In the year 859 too, being the 245th of the Hegira, violent earthquakes happened in many provinces of the Moslem dominions; and the springs at Mecca failed to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, that the celebrated well Zemzem was almost dried up, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> sold for 100 dirhems a bottle.\n\nIn the 247th year of the Hegira, the caliph was assassinated at the instance of his son Al Montafer; who succeeded him, and died in six months after. He was succeeded by Al Mollan, who in the year of the Hegira 252 was forced to abdicate the throne by his brother Al Motazz, who afterwards caused him to be privately murdered. He did not long enjoy the dignity of which he had so iniquitously possessed himself; being deplored by the Turkish militia (who now began to set up and depose caliphs as they pleased) in the 255th year of the Hegira. After his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a>, he was sent under escort from Sarra Manray to Baghdad, where he died of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THIRST\">thirst</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>, after a reign of four years and about seven months. The fate of this caliph was peculiarly hard; the Turkish troops had mutinied for their pay; and Al Motazz, not having money to satisfy their demands, applied to his mother named Kabiha for 50,000 dinars. This she refused, telling him that she had no money at all, although it afterwards appeared that she was possessed of immense treasures. After his deposition, however, she was obliged to discover them, and even depose them in the hands of the new caliph Al Mokhtadi. They consisted of 1,000,000 dinars, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUSHEL\">bushel</a> of emeralds, and another of pearls, and three pounds and three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of rubies of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of fire.\n\nAl Mokhtadi, the new caliph, was the son of one of Baghdad. Al Wathek's concubines named Korb, or Karb, who is by some supposed to have been a Christian. The beginning of his reign is remarkable for the irruption of the Zenjians, a people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUBIA\">Nubia</a>, Ethiopia, and the jins in country of the Caffres, into Arabia, where they penetrated into the neighbourhood of Bafra and Cufa. The chief of this gang of robbers, who, according to some historians, differed but little from wild beasts, was Ali Ebn Mohammed Ebn Abdalrahman, who falsely gave himself out to be of the family of Ali Ebn Abu Taleb. This made such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> upon the Shites in those parts, that they flocked to him in great numbers; which enabled him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> upon the cities of Bafra and Ramla, and even to pass the Tigris at the head of a formidable army. He then took the title of Prince of the Zenjians, in order to ingratiate himself with those barbarians, of whom his army was principally composed.\n\nIn the 267th year of the Hegira, Al Mokhtadi was barbarously murdered by the Turks who had raised him to the throne, and was succeeded by Al Montafer, the son of Al Motawakkil. This year the prince of the Zenjians, Ali, or as he is also called Al Habib, made incursions to the very gates of Baghdad, doing prodigious mischief wherever he passed. The caliph therefore sent against him one Jolan with a considerable army; he was overthrown, however, with very great slaughter by the Zenjians, who made himself master of 24 of the caliph's largest ships in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of Bafra, put a vast number of the inhabitants of Obolla to the sword, and feasted upon the town. Not content with this, he set fire to it, and soon reduced it to ashes, the houses mostly consisting of the wood of a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> tree called by the Arabians Sag. From thence he marched to Abadan, which likewise surrendered to him. Here he found immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a>, which enabled him to possess himself of the whole district of Ahwaz. In short, his forces being now increased to 80,000 strong, most of the adjacent territories, and even the caliph's court itself, were struck with terror.\n\nIn the 257th year of the Hegira, Al Habib continued victorious, defeated several armies sent against him by the caliph, reduced the city of Bafra, and put 20,000 of the inhabitants to the sword. The following year, the caliph, supported by his brother Al Mowaffek, had formed a design of circumferring the power of the Turkish soldiery, who had for some time given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> to the caliphs themselves. But this year the Zenjians made so rapid a progress in Persia, Arabia, and Irak, that he was obliged to suspend the execution of his design, and even to employ the Turkish troops to assist his brother Al Mowaffek in opposing these robbers. The first of the caliph's generals who encountered Al Habib this year, was defeated in several engagements, and had his army at last entirely destroyed. After this Al Mowaffek and another general named Moheh advanced against him. In the first engagement Moheh being killed by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARROW\">arrow</a>, the caliph's troops retired; but Al Mowaffek put them afterwards in such a posture of defence, that the enemy durst not renew the attack. Several other sharp encounters happened this year, in which neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> gained great advantage; but, at last, some contagious distempers breaking out\nout in Al Mowaffek's army, he was obliged to conclude a truce, and retire to Walet to refresh his troops.\n\nIn the 259th year of the Hegira, commencing Nov. 7, 872, the war between the caliph and Al Habib still continued. Al Mowaffek, upon his arrival at Bagdad, sent Mohammed furnished Al Mowalled with a powerful army to act against the Zenjians; but he could not hinder them from ravaging the province of Ahwaz, cutting off about 50,000 of the caliph's subjects, and dismantling the city of Ahwaz; and notwithstanding the utmost efforts of all the caliph's generals, no considerable advantages could be gained either this or the following year.\n\nIn the 261st year of the Hegira, beginning October 16, 874, Mohammed Ebn Wafel, who had killed the caliph's governor of Pars, and afterwards made himself master of that province, had several engagements with Al Habib, but with what success is not known. The caliph, having been apprized of the state of affairs on that side, annexed the government of Pars, Ahwaz, and Bafra, to the prefecture he had given to Musa Ebn Baga, whom he looked upon as one of the best generals he had. Musa, soon after his nomination to that post, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> Abdalrahman Ebn Molleh as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a> to Ahwaz, giving him as a colleague and assistant one Tifam, a Turk. Mohammed Ebn Wafel, however, refusing to obey the orders of Abdalrahman and Tifam, a fierce conflict ensued, in which the latter was defeated, and Abdalrahman taken prisoner. After this victory, Mohammed advanced against Musa Ebn Boga himself; but that general finding he could not take possession of his new government without a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of blood, recalled the deputies from their provinces, and made the best of his way to Sarra Manray. After this, Yakub Ebn Al Leit, having taken Khorasan from the descendants of Thaher, attacked and defeated Mohammed Ebn Wafel, seizing on his palace, where he found a sum of money amounting to 40,000,000 dirhems.\n\nThe next year Yakub Ebn Leit being grown formidable by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> of Ahwaz and a considerable portion of Pars, or at least the Persian Irak, declared war against the caliph. Against him Al Motamed dispatched Al Mowaffek; who having defeated him with prodigious slaughter, plundered his camp, and pursued him into Khorasan; where meeting with no opposition, he entered Nifabur, and released Mahomet the Thaherian, whom Yakub had detained in prison three years. As for Yakub himself, he made his escape with great difficulty, though he and his family continued several years in possession of many of the conquests he had made. This war with Yakub proved a scataneous diversion in favour of Al Habib, who this year defeated all the forces sent against him, and ravaged the district of Walet.\n\nThe following year, being the 263d of the Hegira, beginning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> 24, 876, the caliph's forces, under the command of Ahmed Ebn Lehuna, gained two considerable advantages over Al Habib; but being at last drawn into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBUSCADE\">ambuscade</a>, they were almost totally destroyed, their general himself making his escape with the utmost difficulty; nor were the caliph's forces able, during the course of the next year, to make the least impression upon these rebels.\n\nIn the 265th year of the Hegira, beginning September 3, 878, Ahmed Ebn Tolun rebelled against the caliph, and set up for himself in Egypt. Having assembled a considerable force, he marched to Antioch, and besieged Sima the governor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEPPO\">Aleppo</a> and all the rebellious provinces known among the Arabs by the name of Al Egypt Awajem, in that city. As the beleaguered found that he whom they resolved to carry the place by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSAULT\">assault</a>, they thought not be sup- fit, after a short defense, to submit, and to put Sima prilled into his hands. Ahmed no sooner had that officer in his power, than he caused him to be beheaded; after which he advanced to Aleppo, the gates of which were immediately opened unto him. Soon after, he reduced Damascus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEMS\">Hems</a>, Hamath, Kinusfrin, and Al Rakka, situated upon the eastern bank of the Euphrates. This rebellion so exasperated Al Motamed, that he caused Ahmed to be publicly curled in all the mosques belonging to Bagdad and Irak; and Ahmed on his part ordered the same malediction to be thundered out against the caliph in all the mosques within his jurisdiction. This year also a detachment of Al Habib's troops penetrated into Irak, and made themselves masters of four of the caliph's ships laden with corn; then they advanced to Al Nomanic, laid the greatest part of it in ashes, and carried off with them several of the inhabitants prisoners. After this they possessed themselves of Jarfaraya, where they found many prisoners more, and destroyed all the adjacent territory with fire and sword.\n\nThis year there were four independent powers in the Four independent dominions, besides the house of Ommiyah in pendent Spain, viz. The African Moilems, or Aglabites, who bowers had for a long time acted independently; Ahmed in Syria and Egypt; Al Leit in Khorasan; and Al Ha-minions, bibr in Arabia and Irak.\n\nIn the 266th year of the Hegira, beginning August 23, 879, Al Habib reduced Ramhormoz, burnt the fatly mosque there to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, put a vast number of the inhabitants to the sword, and carried away great numbers, as well as a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of spoil.\n\nThis was his last successful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a>; for the following, Al Mowaffek, attended by his son Abul <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AD\">Ad</a>-bad succes bas, having attacked him with a body of 10,000 horse and death, and a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANTRY\">infantry</a>, notwithstanding the vast disparity of numbers (Al Habib's army amounting to 100,000 men), defeated him in several battles, recovered most of the towns he had taken, together with an immense quantity of spoil, and released 5000 women that had been thrown into prison by these barbarians. After these victories, Al Mowaffek took post before the city of Al Mabiya', built by Al Habib, and the place of his residence; burnt all the ships in the harbour; thoroughly pillaged the town; and then entirely dismantled it. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of this place, in which he found immense treasures, Al Mowaffek pursued the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> Zenjians, put several of their chiefs to the sword, and advanced to Al Mokhtara, a city built by Al Habib. As the place was strongly fortified, and Al Habib was posted in its neighbourhood, with an army, according to Abu Jafer Al Tabari, of 300,000 men, Al Mowaffek perceived that the reduction of it would be a matter of some difficulty. He therefore built a fortress opposite to it, where he erected a mosque, and coined money. The new city, from its founder, was called by the Arabs Al Mowaffekkia, and soon rendered considerable by the settlement of several wealthy merchants there. The city of Al Mokhtara being reduced to great straits was at last taken by storm, and given up to\nBagdad, be plundered by the caliph's troops; after which Al Mowafek defeated the numerous forces of Al Habib in such a manner, that they could no more be rallied during that campaign.\n\nThe following year, being the 268th of the Hegira, Al Mowafek penetrated again into Al Mabiya', and demolished the fortifications which had been raised since its former reduction, though the rebels disputed every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> of ground. Next year he again attacked Al Habib with great bravery; and would have entirely defeated him, had he not been wounded in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> with an arrow, which obliged him to find a retreat. However, as soon as he was cured of his wound, Al Mowafek advanced a third time to Al Mabiya', made himself master of that metropolis, threw down the walls that had been raised, put many of the inhabitants to the sword, and carried a vast number of them into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a>.\n\nThe 27th year of the Hegira, commencing July 11th 883, proved fatal to the rebel Al Habib. Al Mowafek made himself a fourth time master of Al Mabiya', burnt Al Habib's palace, seized upon his family, and sent them to Sarra Manam. As for the usurper himself, he had the good fortune to escape at this time; but being closely pursued by Al Mowafek into the province of Ahwaz, where the shattered remains of his forces were entirely defeated, he at last fell into the hands of the victor, who ordered his head to be cut off, and carried through a great part of that region which he had so long disturbed. By this complete victory Al Mowafek obtained the title of Al Najir Lidmilhab, that is, the protector of Mohommetanifin. This year also died Ahmed Ebn Tolun, who had feigned upon Egypt and Syria, as we have already observed: and was succeeded by his son Khamarawiyah.\n\nThe next year, a bloody engagement happened between the caliph's forces commanded by Al Mowafek's son, and those of Khamarawiyah, who had made an irruption into the caliph's territories. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> was fought between Al Ramla and Damascus. In the beginning, Khamarawiyah found himself so hard pressed, that his men were obliged to give way; upon which, taking for granted that all was lost, he fled with great precipitation, even to the borders of Egypt; but, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, his troops being ignorant of the flight of their general, returned to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>, and gained a complete victory. After this, Khamarawiyah, by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> and mild administration, gained the affections of his subjects, that the caliph found it impossible to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> the least advantage over him. In the 27th year of the Hegira, he overthrew one of the caliph's generals named Abul Saj, at Al Bathia near the city of Damascus; after which he advanced to Al Rakka on the Euphrates, and made himself master of that place. Having annexed several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> provinces to his former dominions, and left some of his friends in whom he could confide to govern them, he then returned into Egypt, the principal part of his empire, which now extended from the Euphrates to the borders of Nubia and Ethiopia.\n\nThe following year, being the 278th of the Hegira, was remarkable for the death of Al Mowafek. He died of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEPHANTIASIS\">elephantiasis</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LEPROSY\">leprosy</a>; and while in his last illness, could not help observing, that of 100,000 men whom he commanded, there was not one to mis-able as himself. This year is also remarkable for the first disturbances raised in the Moism empire by the Karmanians. The origin of this fact is not certainly known; but the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> opinion is, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> fellow, of some called Karmata, came from Khuzestan to the villages near Cufi, and there pretended great sanctity, and strictness of life, and that God had enjoined him to pray 50 times a day; pretending also to invite people to the obedience of a certain Imam of the family of Mahomet; and this way of life he continued till he had made a very great party, out of whom he chose twelve as his apostles to govern the rest, and to propagate his doctrines. He also assumed the title of prince, and obliged every one of his earlier followers to pay him a dinar a-year. But Al Haidam, the governor of that province, finding men neglected their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, and their husbandry in particular, to say those 50 prayers a-day, seized the fellow, and having put him in prison, swore that he should die. This being overheard by a girl belonging to the governor, she, out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPASSION\">compassion</a>, took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KEY\">key</a> of the dungeon at night from under her master's head, released the man, and restored the key to its place while her master slept. The next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> the governor found his prisoner gone; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a> being publicly known, raised great admiration; Karmata's adherents giving out that God had taken him into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>. After this he appeared in another province, and declared to a great number of people he got about him, that it was not in the power of any person to do him hurt; notwithstanding which, his courage failing him, he retired into Syria, and was never heard of any more. After his disappearance, the sect continued and increased; his disciples pretending that their matter had manifested itself to be a true prophet, and had left them a new law, wherein he had changed the ceremonies and form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a> used by the Moismans, &c. From this year, 278, these sectaries gave almost continual disturbance to the caliphs and their subjects, committing great disorders in Chaldea, Arabia, and Mesopotamia, and at length established a considerable principality.\n\nIn the 279th year of the Hegira died the caliph Al <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SULTAN\">Sultan</a> of Motamed; and was succeeded by Al Motaded, son to Al Mowafek. The first year of his reign, Al Motaded demanded in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Khamarawiyah, the caliph sultan, or caliph, of Egypt; which was agreed to by Al Motaded him with the utmost joy, and their nuptials were celebrated with great pomp in the 282nd year of the Hegira. He carried on a war with the Karmatians; but very unsuccessfully, his forces being defeated with great slaughter, and his general Al Abbas taken prisoner. This caliph also granted to Harun, son to Khamarawiyah, the perpetual possession of Awasam and Kinnifin, which he annexed to that of Egypt and Syria, upon condition that he paid him an annual tribute of 45,000 dinars. He died in the year of the Hegira 289, and was succeeded by his son Al Moctaffi.\n\nThis caliph proved a warlike and successful prince. He gained several advantages over the Karmatians, but was not able to reduce them. The Turks, however, having invaded the province of Mawaradnah, were defeated with great slaughter; after which, Al Moctaffi carried on a successful war against the Greeks, from whom he took Seleucia. After this he invaded Syria and\nBagdad, and Egypt, which provinces he recovered from the house of Ahmed Ebn Tolun.\n\nThe reduction of Egypt happened in the 292nd year of the Hegira, after which the war was renewed with success against the Greeks and Karmatians. The caliph died in the 295th year of the Hegira, after a reign of about six years and a half. He was the last of the caliphs who made any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> by their warlike exploits. His successors Al Moktader, Al Kaher, and Al Radi, were so distressed by the Karmatians and numberless usurpers who were every day starting up, that by the 325th year of the Hegira they had nothing left but the city of Bagdad. In the 324th year of the Hegira, commencing November 30, 935, the caliph Al Radi, finding himself distressed on all sides by usurpers, and having a vizir of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a>, instituted a new office superior to that of vizir, which he entitled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMIR\">Emir</a> Al Omra, or Commandant of commandants. This great officer was trusted with the management of all military affairs, and had the entire management of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINANCES\">finances</a> in a much more absolute and unlimited manner than any of the caliph's vizirs ever had. Nay, he officiated for the caliph in the great mosque at Bagdad, and had his name mentioned in the public prayers throughout the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. In short, the caliph was so much under the power of this officer, that he could not apply a single dinar to his own use without the leave of the Emir Al Omra. In the year 325, the Mollem empire, once so great and powerful, was shared among the following usurpers:\n\nThe cities of Wasit, Bafra, and Cufa, with the rest of the Arabian Irak, were considered as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the Emir Al Omra, though they had been in the beginning of the year seized upon by a rebel called Al Baridi, who could not be driven out of them.\n\nThe country of Pars, Farfelan, or Perfa properly so called, was possessed by Amado'ddawla Ali Ebn Buyla, who resided in the city of Shiraz.\n\nPart of the tract denominated Al Jabol, together with Persian Irak, which is the mountainous part of Perfa, and the country of the ancient Parthians, obeyed Rueno'ddowla, the brother of Amado'ddawla, who resided at Hipahan. The other part of that country was possessed by Wallmakin the Deylamite.\n\nDiyar Rahia, Diyar Becr, Diyar Modar, and the city of Al Mawcel, or Morul, acknowledged for their sovereigns a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of princes called Hamdanites.\n\nEgypt and Syria no longer obeyed the caliphs, but Mahomet Ebn Taj, who had formerly been appointed governor of these provinces.\n\nAfrica and Spain had long been independent.\n\nSicily and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRETE\">Crete</a> were governed by princes of their own.\n\nThe provinces of Khorsan and Mawaralnahr were under the dominion of Al Nafr Ebn Ahmed, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYNASTY\">dynasty</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SAMARITANS\">Samaritans</a>.\n\nThe provinces of Tabreitan, Jorjan, or Georgia, and Mazanderan, had kings of the first dynasty of the Deylamites.\n\nThe province of Kerman was occupied by Abu Ali Mahomet Ebn Eyila Al Sammani, who had made himself master of it a short time before.\n\nAnd,\n\nLastly, the provinces of Yamama and Bahrain, including the district of Hajar, were in the possession of Abu Thaher the Karmatian.\n\nThus the caliphs were deprived of all their dominions, and reduced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> pontiffs; in which light, though they continued for some time to be regarded by the neighbouring princes, yet their power never arrived to any height. In this low state the caliphs continued till the year of the Hegira 656, commencing January 8, 1238. This year was rendered remarkable by the taking of Bagdad by Hulaku the Mogul or Tartar; who likewise abolished the caliphate, putting the reigning caliph Al Mo'tafem Bilah to a most cruel death. These diabolical conquerors, after this, they had taken the city, massacred, according to custom, a vast number of the inhabitants; and after they had plundered it, set it on fire. The spoil they took from thence was prodigiously great, Bagdad being then looked upon as the first city in the world.\n\nBagdad remained in the hands of the Tartars or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOGULS\">Moguls</a> to the year of the Hegira 795, of Christ 1392, the city when it was taken by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TAMERLANE\">Tamerlane</a> from Sultan Ahmed since that time. Ibn Weis; who being incapable of making head against Tamerlane's numerous forces, found himself obliged to send all his baggage over the Tigris, and abandoned his capital to the conqueror. He was, however, hotly pursued by his enemy's detachments to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of Karbella, where several skirmishes happened, and a considerable number of men were lost on both sides. Notwithstanding this disaster, he found means to escape the fury of his pursuers, took refuge in the territories of the Greek emperor, and afterwards repossessed himself of the city of Bagdad. There he remained till the year of the Hegira 803, when the city was taken a second time by Tamerlane; who nevertheless restored it to him, and he continued sovereign of the place till driven from thence by Miram Shaw. Still, however, he found means to return; but in the 81st year of the Hegira was finally expelled by Kara Yulef the Turcman. The descendants of Kara Yulef continued masters of Bagdad till the year of the Hegira 875, of Christ 1470, when they were driven out by Ulun Cassim. The family of this prince continued till the year of the Hegira 914, of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> 1508, when Shah Ithmael, furred Sufi or Safi, the first prince of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> family reigning in Iran or Perfa, till the dethroning of the late Shah Hofeim, made himself master of it. From that time to this Bagdad has continued to be a bone of contention between the Turks and Persians. It was taken by Soliman furred the magnificent, and retaken by Shah Abbas the great, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Perfa; but being at length besieged by Amruth or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MORAD\">Morad</a> IV. with a formidable army, it was finally obliged to surrender to him in the year 1638; since which time the Persians have never been able to make themselves masters of it for any length of time.\n\nThe city is large and populous; and the advantage of the Tigris is so considerable, with regard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, that although the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> is excessively hot, and in other respects far from being agreeable, yet the number of its inhabitants is computed at 300,000; but before the plague broke out there, they were supposed to be four times that number. It is governed by a baishaw, whose authority extends as far as Curdistan. The revenues would be immense if the government were mild; but instead thereof, oppression rules here with the most despotic sway. The baishaw is continually extorting money from the poor inhabitants, and none <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a>.\nBagdad. suffer more than the unfortunate Jews and Christians, many of whom are put to the most cruel tortures in order to force their property from them. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of tyranny and oppression has almost entirely driven them out of the city; in consequence of which the trade must suffer very considerably, they being generally the principal merchants in the place. In the months of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, July, and August, the weather is so extremely hot, as to oblige the inhabitants to live for these months in subterranean apartments, which are arched over, to admit the freer circulation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. The houses are generally large, built of brick and cement, and are arched over. Many of the windows are made of elegant Venetian glass; the ceilings are usually ornamented with a kind of chequered work, which has generally a noble appearance; most of the houses have a court-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-YARD\">yard</a> before them, in the middle of which is a little plantation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a> trees, &c., that has a very pleasing effect. The soil, which would produce not only every convenience in life, but almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a>, is through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> indolence of the Turks, and the many faults in the government of the country, in a great measure uncultivated and neglected. The revenues are computed at 125 lacks of piastres, or \u00a3562,500 sterling; but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> part of this is not collected, owing to the slothfulness of the Turks, who suffer the Arabs to plunder them of the remainder. This in some measure accounts for the cruelties and extortions that are continually practised here. As the baihaw lives in all the splendour of a sovereign prince, and maintains a very large army, he could not be able to defray his expenses, was he not to have recourse to oppression and injustice; and he, by his extensive power, acting almost independent of the Porte, only acknowledges it to bring in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> from thence yearly in his favour.\n\nThe bazars or markets here are large and extensive; being covered over with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> built of masonry, and divided into different streets, filled with shops of all kinds of merchandise, to the number of 12,000. Everything a person can have occasion for may be had there. The number of houses in the city is computed at near 80,000; and each house and shop pay an annual tribute to the baihaw, which is calculated to produce the sum of 300,000 sterling. Besides these immense revenues that are collected, the baihaw pretends, that by repairs on the fortifications 30,000l. or 40,000l. are annually expended, when not so many hundreds are taken out of his coffers for that purpose. Likewise clearing the river and mending the bridge become a charge greater than their income, and probably not the value of an English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a> is expended.\n\nTo support the expense of the feraglio, their clothes, caparisons of their horses, and every outward pomp, the amount is considerable.\n\nOn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> side of the town stands the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITADEL\">citadel</a>, which commands the river; and consists of curtains and battlements, on which some very long cannon are mounted, with two mortars in each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTERY\">battery</a>, placed on no other beds than the ground, and in very bad condition. The carriages of the guns are likewise so unwieldy, and in such a shattered condition, that from their appearance they would not support one firing, but would be shaken in pieces. Their elevations were from 30 to 40 degrees, but they had no quoins to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> them. There are, besides, a number of small towers, and loop-holes for musketry, placed at certain distances, all well encompassed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DITCH\">ditch</a> of 25 feet deep, which can be filled at any time by the waters of the Tigris. The citadel is so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the houses, that it might be easily taken if possession was once gained of the town; but an attack made towards the land would not probably be successful, as sluices might with the greatest facility be cut into the ditch, and so overflow the country for miles round; but it is said an advantageous attack might be made from the water.\n\nThe city, which is fortified by lofty thick walls of brick covered with earth, and strengthened by great towers much resembling cavalier battions, the whole being surrounded by a deep ditch, is in the form of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>; but the walls in many places are broken down, occasioned by the disputes which happened on the death of Abdulla <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BASHAW\">Bashaw</a> a few years ago, when two competitors arose in Bagdad for the baihawic, who fought several times in the town and citadel, and laid great part of it in ruins. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERIM\">interim</a>, the governor of Mouful and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINEVEH\">Nineveh</a> being appointed bashaw by the Porte, came hither with a considerable army, and took possession of the sovereignty, vanquishing his two opponents. Opposite to the city, on the other side of the river, are very extensive suburbs, from whence shells might be thrown into the town, which would have a dreadful effect on a place so closely built. There is a communication between the city and suburbs by a bridge of boats; the only kind of bridge which that river will admit of, as it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> and deep, and in its ordinary course very rapid. At certain seasons it swells to a prodigious height, and overflowing the country occasions many miseries on that side opposite to the city. Among these are several towns and villages, whose inhabitants are said to be the ancient Chaldeans: they are of a particular religion, which they pretend is that of Seth. The inhabitants of this city are composed chiefly of Persians, Armenians, Turks, Arabs, and Jews, which last act in the capacity of schroffs, or bankers, to the merchants. The Jews, notwithstanding the severe treatment they meet with from the government, are induced to live here from a reverence to the prophet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EZEKIEL\">Ezekiel</a>, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAUSOLEUM\">mausoleum</a> they pretend is a day's journey from the city. Besides the Jews who reside here, there are many that come every year out of devotion to visit the prophet's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a>. There are also two European gentlemen, a Venetian and a Frenchman, with five Romish priests, who are Frenchmen and Italians. Two chapels are permitted for those of the Romish and Greek persuasions; at the former the five priests officiate. In the city are several large beautiful mosques, but into which Christians are never suffered to enter if known to be such, for fear it should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFILE\">defile</a> them. The Mahometan women are very richly dressed, wearing bracelets on their arms and jewels in their ears: the Arabian women have the partition between their nostrils bored, wherein they wear rings.\n\nThere are also a number of antique buildings. At the distance of about ten miles stand the ruins of an ancient tower called the Tower of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIMROD\">Nimrod</a>. Whether this tower was at first of a square or round form is now difficult to determine; though the former is most probable,\nBaggage, babble, because all the remaining bricks are placed square, and not in the least circular. The bricks are all twelve inches square and four and a half thick.\n\nThe cement is of mud or lime, mixed with broken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REED\">reed</a>, as we mix hair with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a>; which flume might either have been had from one of the great rivers, or taken out of one of the swamps in the plain, with which the country hereabout very much abounds. The height of the ruin is 126 feet; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> of the largest and middle part about 100 feet. It would appear to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> to the centre; yet near the top there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> opening of an oval form. The circumference of that part of the tower which remains, and is above the rubbish, is about 300 feet; but probably could the foundation be come at, it would be found of far greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>.

The lesser was carried by the soldier <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> his back, and called sarcina; consisting of the things most necessary to life, and which he could not do without. Hence colligere sarcinam, packing up the baggage, is used for decamping, edtra movere. The greater and heavier was carried on horses and vehicles, and called onera. Hence onera vehiculorum, sarcinae hominum. The baggage-horses were denominated fagmentarii equi.\n\nThe Roman soldiers in their marches were heavy loaded; insomuch, that they were called by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of jest muli mariani, and cervus. They had four sorts of luggage, which they never went without, viz. corn or baccellatum, utensils, valli, and arms.

'Alas!' (said the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>), the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> of fate is now accomplished by your own fault: it is the web which you have woven, the thorns of the tree which yourself have planted. I wished to spare, and even to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFIX\">affix</a>, the champion of the Molems; you braved our threats, you despised our friend-\nBajazet, ship; you forced us to enter your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> with our invincible armies. Behold the event. Had you vanquished, I am not ignorant of the fate which you reserved for myself and my troops. But I diddian to retaliate: your life and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> are secure; and I shall express my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> to God by my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLEMENCY\">clemency</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>.\" The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> captive showed some signs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPENTANCE\">repentance</a>, accepted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMILIATION\">humiliation</a> of a robe of honour, and embraced with tears his son Moufa, who, at his request, was sought and found among the captives of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>.\n\nThe Ottoman princes were lodged in a splendid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAVILION\">pavilion</a>; and the respect of the guards could be surpassed only by their vigilance. On the arrival of the haram from Bourfa, Timour restored the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> Despina and her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> to their father and husband; but he privately requested, that the Servian princes, who had hitherto been indulged in the profession of Chritianity, should embrace without delay the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of the prophet. In the feast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a>, to which Bajazet was invited, the Mogul emperor placed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCEPTRE\">sceptre</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, with a solemn assurance of restoring him with an increase of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> to the throne of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>. But the effect of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> was disappointed by the sultan's untimely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; amidst the care of the most skilful physicians, he expired of an apoplexy at Akkhehr, the Antioch of Piidria, about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> months after his defeat. The victor dropped a tear over his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>; his body, with royal pomp, was conveyed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAUSOLEUM\">mausoleum</a> which he had erected at Bourfa; and his son Moufa, after receiving a rich present of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> and jewels, of horses and arms, was invested by a patent in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INK\">ink</a> with the kingdom of Anatolia.\n\n\"Such is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> of a generous conqueror, which has been extracted from his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a>, and dedicated to his son and grandson, 19 years after his decease; and, at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> was remembered by thousands, a manifest falsehood would have implied a satire on his real conduct. On the other hand, of the harsh and ignominious treatment of Bajazet there is also a variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>. The Turkish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANNALS\">annals</a> in particular, which have been consulted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> transcribed by Leucavius, Pocock, and Cantemir, unanimously deplore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a> of the iron cage; and some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> may be allowed to national historians, who cannot stigmatize the Tartar without uncovering the shame of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>.\" From these opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREMISES\">premises</a>, Mr Gibbon thinks a fair and moderate conclusion may be deduced. He is satisfied that Sherefeddin Ali has faithfully described the first oftentimes interview, in which the conqueror, whose spirits were harmonized by success, affected the character of generosity. But his mind was insensibly alienated by the unfeigned arrogance of Bajazet; the complaints of his enemies, the Anatolian princes, were just and vehement; and Timour betrayed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of leading his royal captive in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMARCAND\">Samarcand</a>. An attempt to facilitate his escape by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a> a mine under the tent, provoked the Mogul emperor to impose a harsher restraint; and in his perpetual marches, an iron cage on a waggon might be invented, not as a wanton insult, but as a rigorous precaution. Timour had read in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol8.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a> history a similar treatment of one of his predecessors, a king of Peria; and Bajazet was condemned to represent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> and expiate the guilt of the Roman Caesar. But the strength of his mind and body fainted under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, and his premature death might without injustice be ascribed to the severity of Timour. He warred not, however, with the dead; a tear and a sepulchre were all that he could bestow on a captive who was delivered from his power; and if Moufa, the son of Bajazet, was permitted to reign over the ruins of Bourfa, the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Anatolia had been restored by the conqueror to their lawful sovereigns.","sp":383,"ep":384},{"h":"BAIKAL","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> lake in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>, lying between 52 and 55 degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>.

And, lest the intention of the law should be frustrated by the justices requiring bail to a greater amount than the nature of the case demands, it is expressly declared by statute 1 W. and M. st. 2, c. 1, that excessive bail ought not to be required; though what bail shall be called excessive, must be left to the courts, on considering the circumstances of the case, to determine.

In case of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANSLAUGHTER\">manslaughter</a>, if the prisoner be clearly the slayer, and not barely suspected to be so; or if any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDICTMENT\">indictment</a> be found against him; nor, 4. Such as, being committed for felony, have broken prison; because it not only carries a presumption of guilt, but is also superadding one felony to another: 5. Persons outlawed: 6. Such as have abjured the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALM\">realm</a>: 7. Persons taken with the mainour, or in the fact of felony: 8. Persons <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with arson: 9. Excommunicated persons, taken by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRIT\">writ</a> de excommunicato capiendo: all which are clearly not admissible to bail by the justices. Others are of a dubious nature; as, 10. Thieves openly defamed and known: 11. Persons charged with other felonies, or manifest and enormous offences, not being of good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>: and, 12. Accessories to felony, that labour under the same want of reputation. These seem to be in the discretion of the justices, whether bailable or not. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> are such as may be bailed upon offering sufficient surety; as, 13. Persons of good fame, charged with a bare suspicion of manslaughter, or other infamous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOMICIDE\">homicide</a>: 14. Such persons being charged with petit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARCENY\">larceny</a> or any felony, not before specified: or, 15. With being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCESSORY\">accessory</a> to any felony. Lastly, it is agreed, that the court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENCH\">bench</a> (or any judge thereof in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of vacation) may bail for any crime whatsoever, be it treason, murder, or any other offence, according to the circumstances of the case. And herein the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> of the law is very manifest. To allow bail to be taken commonly for such enormous crimes, would greatly tend to elude the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>: and yet there are cases, though they rarely happen, in which it would be hard and unjust to confine a man in prison, though accused even of the greatest offence. The law has therefore provided one court, and only one, which has a discretionary power of bailing in any case: except only, even to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> jurisdiction, and of course to all inferior ones, such persons as are committed by either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of parliament, so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SESSION\">session</a> lasts; or such as are committed for contempts by any of the king's superior courts of justice.

As the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALM\">realm</a> is divided into counties, so every county is divided into hundreds; within which in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> times the people had justice ministered to them by the officers of every hundred. But now the hundred courts, except certain franchises, are swallowed in the county-courts; and the bailiff's...\nbailiff's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> and office is grown into contempt, they being generally officers to serve writs, &c., within their liberties. Though, in other respects, the name is still in good esteem; for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> magistrates in divers towns are called bailiffs or baillies; and sometimes the persons to whom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s cattle are committed are termed bailiffs, as the bailiff of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a> Castle, &c.\n\nOf the ordinary bailiffs there are several sorts, viz. sheriff's bailiffs, bailiffs of liberties, &c.\n\nSheriff's bailiffs, or sheriff's officers, are either bailiffs of hundreds, or special bailiffs. Bailiffs of hundreds are officers appointed over those respective districts by the sheriffs, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> fines therein; to summon jurors; to attend the judges and justices at the assizes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>-sessions; and also to execute writs and processes in the several hundreds. But as they are generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> men, and not thoroughly skilful in this latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of their office, that of serving writs, and making arrests and executions, it is now usual to join special bailiffs with them; who are generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> persons employed by the sheriffs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> only of their adroitness and dexterity in hunting and seizing of their prey.\n\nBailiffs of liberties are those bailiffs who are appointed by every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> within his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, to execute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, and do such offices therein as the bailiff errant doth at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> in the county; but bailiffs errant or itinerant, to go up and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the county to serve process, are out of use.\n\nThere are also bailiffs of forests, and bailiffs of manors, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> husbandry, fell trees, gather rents, pay quit-rents, &c.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">Water</a>-Bailiff, an officer appointed in all ports, towns, for the searching of ships, gathering the toll for anchorage, &c., and arresting persons for debt, &c., on the water.\n\nBailii, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>, painter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a> views and portraits, was the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> Bailii, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol3.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>; and was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a> in 1584. From his father he learned to draw and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>; but he was afterwards placed under the care of Adrian Verburg, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> with him for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; and when he quitted that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, he studied to much greater advantage with Cornelius Vandervoort, an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a>-painter, and with him he spent about five years. As Vandervoort possessed many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> paintings of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> masters, Bailii, for his own improvement, copied them with critical care and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>; and particularly copied one perspective view of the inside of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, originally painted by Steenwyck, which he finished with such accuracy, that even Steenwyck himself could scarce determine which was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>, or which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a>, when both were placed before him.

In the latter part of his life he discontinued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>, and only drew portraits on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELLUM\">vellum</a> with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEN\">pen</a>, which he heightened with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, and gave them wonderful force and roundness.

In 1683 he was appointed librarian to M. de Lamoginon, advocate-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> to the parliament of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>; of whose library he made a copious index in 35 vols. folio, all written with his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. He died in 1766, after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> many works, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> of which are, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> from 1609, to the peace of Nimeguen in 1679, 4 vols 12mo; Lives of the Saints, 3 vols folio, which he professed to have purged from fables; Jugesmens des Savants, which he extended to 9 vols 12mo; and The life of Des Cartes, 2 vols 4to, which he abridged, and reduced to one vol. 12mo.\n\nBaillieul, a town of France, in the department of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a>, formerly very strong, but now without any fortifications.

Lat. 40. 35.\n\nBailly, Jean Sylvain, a celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> and astronomer, was born at Paris on the 15th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> 1736. He was originally intended for the profession of painting, which his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> had pursued for several generations, and he even had made some progress in the art. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIAS\">bias</a> of his mind leaned too much to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> pursuits, especially to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, and works of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, to permit him to give that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> which is necessary to secure success and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> in any profession.\n\nThe friends of Bailly, who had witnessed the early dawn of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> that it was equally fitted to appear with advantage in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of polite literature, or to shine in the walks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>; and recommended the latter chiefly to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. His acquaintance with La Caille the celebrated geometer commenced, and this at once decided the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his studies, which were now almost entirely devoted to scientific investigations. The first of his labours was the calculation of the comet which appeared in the year 1759. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1763, he was admitted a member of the Academy of Sciences; and in the same year he published a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of the observations made by La Caille in 1760 and 1761 on the zodiacal stars, an elaborate compilation, and of extensive utility. His attention was afterwards directed to the consideration of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>'s satellites. La <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRANGE\">Grange</a>, who now promised to be the first mathematician in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, was the formidable rival of Bailly in the competition for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> question in 1764. The results of his investigations were collected into a treatise, which also contained the history of that part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, and were published in 1766. In 1771 appeared his interesting and important memoir on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">Light</a> of the satellites, which was marked with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of precision and accuracy, till that time altogether unknown in the observations of their eclipses.\n\nThe studies of Bailly were not entirely limited to the cultivation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> science, or to profound physical\nBailly's fysical speculations; his genius shone with equal lustre in those departments of literature which require the rare <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> of nice discrimination of characters, and no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> power of eloquence, to reach excellence. The eloges which he composed for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. Corneille, Leibnitz, Moliere, Cook, La Caille, and Gr\u00e9zet, were universally admired as valuable specimens of fine writing, and added much to his reputation. The distinguished place of secretary of the Academy of Sciences became vacant in 1771; and, supported by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> and influence of Buffon, he offered himself a candidate. But here he was unsuccessful. Condorcet, who was then rising into reputation, and was supported by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> influence of D'Alembert, was preferred to the office.\n\nIn the year 1775, he published at Paris the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the \"History of Ancient Astronomy.\" The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> volume of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> appeared in 1787. In 1779 he gave to the world his \"History of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">Modern</a> Astronomy,\" from the foundation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALEXANDRIAN\">Alexandrian</a> school to the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. These works are of ineffable value, distinguished by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NARRATION\">narration</a>, and interesting detail. He also published a work entitled, \"Letters on the Origin of the Sciences, and of the People of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>;\" which was afterwards followed by another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of \"Letters on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATLANTIS\">Atlantis</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>, and the Ancient History of Asia,\" as a continuation of the same work. These volumes were addressed to Voltaire, with whom he had commenced an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> correspondence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> on this curious subject. The coincidence of his opinions with those of Buffon in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> respecting some of the favourite theories of the latter, brought him into an intimate acquaintance and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> friendship with that celebrated naturalist, which, however, declined and was entirely dissolved, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the opposition which Bailly made to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of the Abb\u00e9 Maury into the French Academy. Bailly had been chosen secretary of this academy in 1784; and in the following year he was admitted into the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres. This was the only instance, since the time of Fontenelle, of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> being at once a member of all the three academies.\n\nIn the year 1784 he was nominated one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> to investigate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGNETISM\">magnetism</a> of Mesmer, which was practised by Delon; and he drew up an elegant report, which was presented to the Academy of Sciences. This report, which was soon afterwards translated into English, not only marked the acuteness and discernment of the author, and contained the most satisfactory and decisive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> with regard to its object, but may be held up as an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> for those who are engaged in similar investigations. In developing the physical effects produced by moral causes, it is of the greatest value; and it is particularly interesting when we consider the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> influence which causes of this nature have impeded on the general opinions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, and even on the destiny of nations.\n\nHitherto we have contemplated Bailly in the shades of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RETIREMENT\">retirement</a>, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> undisturbed retreats of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, employing the energy of a vigorous and comprehensive mind in the profound researches of physical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>: we are now to follow him in his political <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>, and behold him struggling with the adverse interests of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a>, and contending with the unbridled fury of a lawless mob, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of a people whose minds were not prepared to understand, and whose habits were not yet formed to enjoy, the blessings of rational liberty. He was one of the first and most zealous promoters of the revolution in France,\u2014a revolution which not only astonished and convulsed all Europe, but of which the immediate consequences to themselves, and to their country, were neither foreseen nor imagined by those who embarked in it, nor can its ultimate effects even at the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> be appreciated or conjectured,\u2014a revolution which holds out an awful lesson to the leaders of popular faction to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CURB\">curb</a> and repress, rather than to excite and encourage, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of tumult and disorder among a people thrown loose from the necessary restraints of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, which bursts forth with ungovernable fury, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> involves all in one general ruin. In the part which he acted in this bloody struggle, Bailly has had the good fortune to be well spoken of by opposite parties. He has not been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with want of integrity or selfish designs in any part of his conduct; but actuated by a misguided zeal, and dazzled with the prospect of freedom which the warmth of imagination held out, he rashly stepped forward in a cause which he espoused with enthusiasm, and supported with his utmost exertions. But in that cause he fell a sacrifice to the unrelenting spirit of violence and party faction which had been roused, and which could neither be subdued nor regulated. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>-general of France were assembled in 1789, he was elected a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a> to the Tiers \u00c9tat, was afterwards chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a>; and when the national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> was constituted, he continued in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol5.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a>, and was president at the time that the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a> was issued ordering them to disperse. During the struggle which took place between the popular part of the assemblies and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, Bailly was among the most forward in afflicting those popular rights which were then new in France; and he dictated the famous oath to the members of the Tiers \u00c9tat, \"to resist tyrants and tyranny, and never to separate till they had obtained a free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>.\" On the 14th of July following, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> on which the Batte was stormed and taken by the people, he was appointed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> consent, mayor of Paris. In this high office, he is allowed to have discharged the arduous and difficult duties of it with great integrity, courage, and moderation. And while he held this conspicuous situation, he was a powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> in promoting the various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> by which the popular party prevailed over that of the court; and for this, and various other popular actions, he obtained a high degree of favour among the people. But the tide of public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> now swelled beyond all bounds; no restraint could oppose its violent course. The multitude, unhackled by the fetters of despotism, fond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>, and with enthusiastic and unsettled notions of freedom, daily panting for change, could bear no opposition. Bailly, who perhaps now saw when it was too late the general disposition of the people to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a>, still wished the laws to be respected, and hoped by their vigorous execution to restore and preserve tranquillity. He ordered some deputies from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> insurgents at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NANCY\">Nancy</a> to be arrested, and he firmly opposed the rash proceedings of Marat and Hubert; he be-\nBailly came a member of a less promiscuous club than that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JACOBINS\">Jacobins</a>; and exerted himself strongly to persuade the populace to permit the king and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> family to depart to St Cloud. By these measures, which were little relished by a frantic and lawless people, he lost their confidence and favour. But what finally destroyed his popularity, was the tumultuous meeting of the populace on the 17th of July 1791, to demand the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABOLITION\">abolition</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>, when, being called by the national assembly to disperse the mob, who had assaulted the soldiery, he ordered the latter to fire, by which 40 persons were killed and above 100 wounded. Thus become obnoxious to the people whom he had faithfully served, it was no longer desirable for him to hold his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>. He therefore resigned his office at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of the constituent assembly in the end of the year 1791. After this period he lived in retirement, having resumed his philosophical researches. But the times of bloody proscription approached, and he must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> a sacrifice to the ferocious vengeance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a> who now bore unlimited sway. He was accordingly denounced as an enemy to the republic, apprehended and thrown into prison. He was arraigned before a fangirninary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a>, summarily condemned to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> as a conspirator, and was executed the day following, near the spot where he had given the order for the military to fire on the people. On the day of execution, his sufferings, which he bore with the utmost calmness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a>, were ludicrously protracted. Instead of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYMPATHY\">sympathy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPASSION\">compassion</a> which even the worst and the lowest criminal often experiences when he is about to expiate his offences with his life, he was treated by an incensed and barbarous populace, with the most ignominious indignity and cruelty. He wore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> shirt, or badge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a>, and was placed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CART\">cart</a>, with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> tied behind his back. During the whole time of his progress to the place of execution, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> poured incessantly on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. The populace as he passed threw mud at him, and cruelly insulted him with every kind of opprobrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. It was found necessary to remove the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUILLOTINE\">guillotine</a> from the place where it was first erected to firmer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>. During this time he was forced to get out of the cart, and walk round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>, to gratify more fully the implacable and unrelenting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALICE\">malice</a> of the mob. When he was ascending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PLATFORM\">platform</a>, a spectator who was near him, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> of insult exclaimed, \"Bailly, you tremble?\" \"Yes (he instantly replied), but not with fear.\"\n\nThus perished Bailly in the 57th year of his age. In his person he was tall, and of a sedate but striking countenance. He possessed great firmness and decision of character, but far removed from fulness or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APATHY\">apathy</a>. Few philosophers have been more distinguished in so many various departments of science and literature, or have acquired such deserved reputation. In his public stations, as well as in the retirement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> life, his integrity and disinterestedness remained pure and untainted. In the time of his magistracy he spent part of his fortune in relieving the wants of the poor. His wife, whom he married in 1787, survived him. She was the widow of Raymond Gaye, who had been his intimate friend 25 years.","sp":385,"ep":388},{"h":"BAILMENT","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">Law</a>, is a delivery of goods in trust, upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a>, expressed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> implied, that the trust shall be faithfully executed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the bailee.

He died at Bishop's Nymmet on the 5th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1690.\n\nBaker, Thomas, a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> and learned antiquary, descended from a family <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> esteemed, distinguished by its loyalty and affection for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, was born at Crook in 1656. He was educated at the free school at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DURHAM\">Durham</a>, and thence removed to St John's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a> in 1674. He proceeded B.A. 1677; M.A. 1681; was elected fellow, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1679-80; ordained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEACON\">deacon</a> by Bishop Compton of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 20. 1685; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> by Bishop Barlow of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a>, December 19. 1686. Dr Watson, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> of the college, who was nominated, but not yet consecrated, bishop of St David's, offered to take him for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHAPLAIN\">chaplain</a>, which he declined, probably on the prospect of a like offer from Lord Crew bishop of Durham, which he soon after accepted. His lordship collated him to the rectory of Long-Newton in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a>, and the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a>, June 1687; and, as Dr Grey was informed by some of the bishop's family, intended to have given him that of Sedgefield, worth \u00a3600l. or \u00a3700l. a-year, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREBEND\">prebend</a>, had he not incurred his displeasure and left his family for refusing to read King James II.'s declaration for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>. The bishop, who disgraced him for this refusal, and was excepted out of King William's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a>, took the oaths to that king, and kept his bishopric till his death. Mr Baker resigned Long-Newton August 1. 1693, refusing to take the oaths; and retired to his fellowship at St John's, in which he was protected till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 20. 1716-17, when, with one-and-twenty others, he was disfranchised of it. After the passing the Registering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">Act</a> 1723, he was desired to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> his annuity of \u00a340, which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> act required before it was amended and explained. Though this annuity, left him by his father for his fortune, with \u00a320 per annum out of his collieries by his elder <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of his death August 1699, for the remaining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the leafe, which determined at Whitcombide 1722, was now his whole subsistence, he could not be prevailed on to secure himself against the act. He retained a lively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a> of his deprivations; and wrote himself in all his books, as well as in those which he gave to the college library, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> ejectus, and in some ejectus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTOR\">rector</a>. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to reside in the college as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMONER\">commoner</a>-master till his death, which happened July 2. 1740, of a paralytic stroke, being found on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> of his chamber. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a> of June 29, being alone in his chamber, he was struck with a slight apoplectic fit; which abating a little, he recovered his senses, and knew all about him, who were his nephew Burton, Drs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEDFORD\">Bedford</a> and Heberden. He seemed perfectly satisfied and resigned; and when Dr Bedford desired him to take some medicine then ordered, he declined it, saying, he would only take his usual sustenance, which his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BED\">bed</a>-maker knew the times and quantities of giving; he was thankful for the affection and care his friends showed him; but, hoping the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, would by no means endeavour to retard it. His disorder increased, and the third day from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEIZURE\">seizure</a> he departed. Being appointed one of the executors of his elder brother's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, by which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> sum was bequeathed to pious uses, he prevailed on the other two executors, who were his other brother Francis and the Hon. Charles Montague, to lay out \u00a3130l. of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> upon an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> to be settled upon St John's college for six exhibitioners. He likewise gave the college \u00a3100l. for the consideration of \u00a31. a year (then only legal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>) for his life; and to the library several choice books, both printed and MS. medals, and coins; besides what he left to it by his will); which were \"all such books, printed and MS. as he had, and were wanting there.\" All that Mr Baker printed was, 1. \"Reflections on Learning, shewing the insufficiency thereof in its several particulars, in order to evince the usefulness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">Revelation</a>,\" Lond. 1759-1760\" (which went through eight editions: and Mr Boivin, in his \"Method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">Study</a>,\" ranks it among the English classics for purity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>); and, 2. \"The preface to Bishop Fisher's Funeral Sermon for Margaret Countess of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RICHMOND\">Richmond</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DERBY\">Derby</a>, 1758; both without his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>. Dr Grey had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> MS of both in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>. The latter piece is a sufficient specimen of the editor's skill in antiquities to make us regret that he did not live to publish his \"History of St John's College from the foundation of old St John's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> to the present time; with some occasional and incidental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the affairs of the university, and of such private colleges as held <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> or intercourse with the old house or college; collected principally from MSS. and carried on through a succession of matters to the end of Bishop Gunning's mastership, 1670.\" The original, fit for the press, is among the Harleian MSS. No. 7228. His MS. collections relative to the history and antiquities of the university of Cambridge, amounting to 49 volumes in folio and three in quarto, are divided between the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a> and the public library at Cambridge; the former possesses 23 volumes, which he bequeathed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Oxford, his friend and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a>; the latter 16 in folio and three in quarto, which he bequeathed to the university. Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIGHT\">Knight</a> styles him \"the greatest master of the antiquities of this our university;\" and Hearne says, Optandum est ut sive quoque collectanea de antiquitatibus Cantabrigiensibus juris faciatur publici Cl. Bakerus, quippe qui eruditione summa jucundique acri et subaeque pollet. Mr Baker intended something like an Athena Cantabrigiensis, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of the Athena Oxoniensis.\n\nBaker, Henry, an ingenious and diligent naturalist, was born in Fleet-street London, either near the end of the last, or very early in the beginning of the present, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>. His father's profession is not known; but his mother was, in her time, a midwife of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> practice. He was brought up under an eminent bookbinder, who preceded the elder Dodley, to the business of a bookbinder; in which, however, he appears\nBaker pears not to have engaged at all after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPRENTICESHIP\">apprenticeship</a>; or, if he did, it was soon relinquished by him: for though it was in his power to have drawn away all his master's best customers, he would not set up against him. Mr Baker being of a philosophical turn of mind, and having diligently attended to the methods which might be practicable and useful in the cure of stammering, and especially in teaching <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAF_AND_DUMB\">deaf and dumb</a> persons to speak, he made this the employment of his life. In the prosecution of so valuable and difficult an undertaking, he was very successful; and several of his pupils, who are still living, bear testimony to the ability and good effect of his instructions. He married Sophia, youngest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of the famous Daniel Defoe, who brought him two sons, both of whom he survived. On the 29th of January 1740 Mr Baker was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries; and, on the 12th of March following, the same honour was conferred upon him by the Royal Society. In 1744, Sir Godfrey Copley's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> medal was bestowed upon him, for having, by his microscopical experiments on the crystallizations and configuration of saline particles, produced the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> discovery during that year. Having led a very useful and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> life, he died at his apartments in the Strand on the 25th of November 1774, being then above 70 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. His wife had been dead some time before; and he only left one grandson, William Baker, who was born February 17, 1763, and to whom, on his living to the age of 21, he bequeathed the bulk of his fortune, which he had acquired by his profession of teaching deaf and dumb persons to speak. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a>, printed books (but not MSS.), curiosities, and collections of every sort, he directed should be sold, which was accordingly done. His fine collection of native and foreign fossils, petrifications, shells, corals, vegetables, ores, &c., with some antiquities and other curiosities, were sold by auction March 13, 1775, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> following days. He was buried, as he desired, in an inexpensive manner, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCHYARD\">churchyard</a> of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>-le-Strand; within which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, on the south wall, he ordered a small tablet to be erected to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>. \"An inscription for it (he said) would probably be found among his papers; if not, he hoped some learned friend would write one agreeable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>.\" This friendly office, however, remains as yet to be performed. Mr Baker was a constant and useful attendant at the meetings of the Royal and Antiquarian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">Societies</a>, and in both was frequently chosen one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>. He was peculiarly attentive to all the new improvements which were made in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, and very solicitous for the prosecution of them. Several of his communications are printed in the Philosophical Transactions; and, besides the papers written by himself, he was the means, by his extensive correspondence, of conveying to the society the intelligence and observations of other inquisitive and philosophical men, both at home and abroad. The Society for the encouragement of arts, manufactures, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, is under singular obligations to our worthy naturalist. As he was one of the earliest members of it, so he contributed in no small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> to its rise and establishment. At its first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> he officiated for some time gratis as secretary. He was many years chairman of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> of accounts; and he took an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> part in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> deliberations of the society. He drew up a short account of the original of this society, and of the concern he himself had in forming it; which was read before the society of antiquaries, and would be a pleasing present to the public. Mr Baker was a poetical writer in the early part of his life. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVOCATION\">Invocation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">Health</a> got abroad without his knowledge; but was reprinted by himself in his Original Poems, serious and humorous, Part I. 8vo. 1725. Part II. came out in 1726. Among these poems are some tales as witty and as loose as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIOR\">Prior</a>'s. He was the author likewise of The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">Universe</a>, a poem intended to restrain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; which has been several times reprinted. His account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>-pot, which was originally published in the Philosophical Transactions, was afterwards enlarged into a separate treatise, and hath gone through several editions. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> publications are, The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">Microscope</a> made Easy, and Employment for the Microscope. The first of these, which was originally published in 1742 or 1743, hath gone through six editions. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> edition of the other, which, to say the least of it, is equally pleasing and instructive, appeared in 1764. These treatises, and especially the latter, contain the most curious and important of the observations and experiments which Mr Baker either laid before the Royal Society or published separately. It has been said of Mr Baker, that he was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> in little things. If it was intended by this language to lessen his reputation, there is no propriety in the stricture. He was an intelligent, upright, and benevolent man, much respected by those who knew him best. His friends were the friends of science and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>: and it will always be remembered by his contemporaries, that no one was more ready than himself to afford those with whom he was conversant in their various researches, and endeavours for the advancement of knowledge and the benefit of society.\n\nBaker, David-Erskine, son to the former, was a young man of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> and learning. Having been adopted by an uncle, who was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>-throwster in Spitalfields, he succeeded him in the business; but wanted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> which are necessary to secure prosperity in trade. He married the daughter of Mr Clendon, a reverend empiric. Like his father, he was both a philosopher and a poet; and wrote several occasional poems in the periodical collections, some of which were much admired at the time; but so violent was his turn for dramatic performance, that he repeatedly engaged with the lowest strolling companies, in spite of every effort of his father to reclaim him. The public was indebted to him for \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPANION\">Companion</a> to the Play-house,\" in two volumes, 1764, 12mo; a work which, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>, had considerable merit, and showed that he possessed a very extensive knowledge of our dramatic authors; and which has since (under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of \"Biographia Dramatica\") been considerably improved by the attention of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> in every respect well qualified for the undertaking.\n\nBaker, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a> or business is to bake <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>. See the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAKING\">Baking</a> and Bread. The learned are in great doubt about the time when baking first became a particular profession and bakers were introduced. It is however generally agreed, that they had their rise in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a>, and passed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>\nBAK\n\nto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PYRRHUS\">Pyrrhus</a>, about the year of Rome 583. Till which time every housewife was her own baker; for the word pifior, which we find in Roman authors before that time, signified a person who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> or pounded the grain in a mill or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a> to prepare it for baking, as Varro observes. According to Athen\u00e6us, the Cappadocians were the most applauded bakers, after them the Lydians, then the Ph\u0153nicians.\u2014To the foreign bakers brought into Rome, were added a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of freed men, who were incorporated into a body, or, as they called it, a college; from which neither they nor their children were allowed to withdraw. They held their effects in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>, and could not dispose of any part of them. Each bake-house had a patronus, who had the superintendency thereof; and these patroni elected one out of their number each year, who had superintendence over all the rest, and the care of the college. Out of the body of the bakers every now and then one was admitted among the senators.\u2014To preserve honour and honesty in the college of bakers, they were expressly prohibited all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with comedians and gladiators; each had his shop or bake-house, and they were distributed into fourteen regions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>. They were excluded from guardianships and other offices, which might divert them from their employment.\u2014By our own statutes bakers are declared not to be handicrafts. No man for using the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> or sciences of baking, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREWING\">brewing</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SURGERY\">surgery</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, shall be interpreted a handicraft. The bakers were a brotherhood in England before the year 1155, in the reign of King Henry II. though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> bakers were not incorporated till 1427, by King Edward III. and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> bakers not till 1621, in King James I.'s time. Their hall is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HARP\">Harp</a>-lane, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a>-street; and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>-day on the first Monday of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>.\u2014They make the 19th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>; and consist of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARDEN\">warden</a>, 4 maters, 30 assistants, and 140 men on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIVERY\">livery</a>, besides the commonalty.\u2014The French had formerly a great baker, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> panetier de France, who had the superintendency of all the bakers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>.

Put your flour into your kneading-trough or trendle; then take about three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of a pint of warm water, and take the tea-spoonful of thick fleady barm and put it into the water, stir it until it is thoroughly mixed with the water; then make a hole in the middle of the flour <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> enough to contain two gallons of water; pour in your small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>; then take a stick about two feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, (which you may keep for that purpose,) and stir in some of the flour, until it is as thick as you would make batter for a pudding; then throw some of the dry flour over it, and go about your usual businels for about an hour: then take about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUART\">quart</a> of warm water more, and pour in; for in one hour you <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> find that small quantity raised so, that it will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> through the dry flour which you throw over it; and when you have poured in the quart of warm water, take your stick as before, and stir in some more flour, until it is as thick as before; then shake some more dry flour over it, and leave it for two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> more, and then you will find it rise and break through the dry flour again; then you may add three quarts or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GALLON\">gallon</a> of water more, and stir in the flour and make it as thick as at first, and cover it with dry flour again; in about three or four hours more you may mix up your dough, and then cover it up warm; and in four or five hours more you may put it into the oven, and you will have as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> bread as though you had put a pint of barm. It does not take above a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an hour more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> than the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of baking, for there is no time lost but that of adding water three or four times.\n\nThe author of this method affirms us that he constantly bakes this way in the morning about six or seven o'clock, puts the flour out, and puts this small quantity of barm into the before-mentioned quantity of water, in an hour's time some more, in two hours more a greater quantity, about noon makes up the dough, and about six in the evening it is put into the oven, and he has always good bread, never heavy nor bitter.\n\nWhen you find, he says, your body of flour spunged large enough, before you put in the rest of your water, you should, with both your hands, mix that which is spunged and the dry flour altogether, and then add the remainder of warm water, and your dough will rise the better and easier.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> he affirms why people make heavy bread is, not because they have not barm enough, but because they do not know that barm is the same to flour\nBAK\n\nas fire is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>; that, as a spark of fire will kindle a large body by only blowing of it up, so will a thimble-full of barn, by adding of warm water, raise or spunge any body of flour; for warm water gives fresh life to that which is before at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>; so that the reason of making bread heavy is, because the body spunged is not large enough, but was made up and put into the oven before it was ripe.\n\nIn regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of seasons, he prescribes, that in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> you should put your water blood-warm; and in winter, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> frosty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, as warm as you can bear your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> in it without making it smart; being sure you cover up your dough very warm in the winter, and your covering of it with dry flour every time you add warm water, will keep in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>; when you have added six or eight quarts of warm water, as before-mentioned, in such a gradual way, you will find all the body of flour which is mixed with the warm water, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of that one tea-spoonful of barn, brought into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a>, waxing or fermenting; for it is to the flour what the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> is to the body.

Baku is a fortress surrounded with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> brick walls; its inhabitants, like those of Derbent, are Persians, Tartars, and a few Armenian merchants. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a> which support the trade of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPHTHA\">naphtha</a>, and the finest rock <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, of both which there are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> side of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>. The inhabitants cultivate saffron and the cotton tree, but not to any considerable advantage. The trade of Baku, though more valuable than that of Derbent, is still inconsiderable, and chiefly carried on with Shamakiee, from whence it draws raw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> and filken stuffs. A Russian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a> is resident at this place. In 1777 Baku belonged to Melik-Mehmed, who was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIBUTARY\">tributary</a> to Feth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALI\">Ali</a> khan of Kuba; the latter possessed the whole province of Shirvan, and was the most powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, next to the khan of Ghilan, upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of the Caspian.

It owed its former commercial importance to the silk which is cultivated in the neighbouring district; this rich production still preserves the town from ruin; though its traffic is greatly reduced by the exorbitant exactions of the khan of Kuba. Formerly the Russians had a factory at this place; and it was also crowded with Turkish and Greek merchants; but at present there are only a few Armenian and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> traders.

It is a question much debated among divines, whether Balaam was a true prophet of God, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> no more than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGICIAN\">magician</a> or fortune-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TELLER\">teller</a>. The Jews indeed are generally of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that he was a busy and pretended astrologer, who, observing when men were under a bad aspect of the stars, pronounced a curse upon them; which sometimes coming to pass, gained him in some neighbouring nations a reputation in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>. Several of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> fathers suppose him to be no more than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> soothsayer, who undertook to tell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> events, and discover secrets, and by no very justifiable arts. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-ORIGEN\">Origen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> needs have it, that he was no prophet, but only one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a>'s sorcerers, and that of him he went to inquire; but that God was pleased to prevent him, and put what answers he pleased into his mouth. It cannot be denied, however, that the scripture expressly calls him a prophet (Pet. ii. 5.) and therefore some later writers have imagined that he had once been a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> and true prophet, till loving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> of iniquity, and profiting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of his office to covetousness, he apostatized from God, and betaking himself to idolatrous practices, fell under the delusion of the devil, of whom he learned all his magical enchantments, though at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a>, when the preservation of his people was concerned, it might be consistent with God's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> to appear to him, and vouchsafe his revelations. As to what passed between him and his ass, when that animal was miraculously enabled to speak to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, commentators are divided in their opinions concerning this fact, whether it really and literally happened as Moses relates it; or whether it be an allegory only, or the mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> or vision of Balaam. This indeed is so wonderful an instance, that several of the Jewish doctors, who upon other occasions are fond enough of miracles, seem as if they would hardly be induced to assent to this. Philo, in his Life of Moses, passes it over in silence; and Maimonides pretends that it happened to Balaam in a prophetic vision only. But St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> (2 Pet. ii. 16.) speaks of this fact as literal and certain, and so all interpreters explain it. St Austin, who understands it exactly according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>, finds nothing in the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> more surprising than the stupidity of Balaam, who heard his ass speak to him, and answered it as if he talked with a reasonable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>. He is of opinion, that this diviner was accustomed to prodigies like this, or that he was strangely blinded by his avarice not to be stopped by an event of so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. Le Clerc thinks, that Balaam might probably have imbibed the doctrine of transmigration of souls, which was certainly very common in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a>; and from thence he might be the less astonished at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> a brute speak. And Dr Patrick thinks that Balaam was in such a rage and fury at the supposed perverseness of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a> crushing his foot, that for the present he could think of nothing else; though the conciseness of Moses's relation, who must be presumed to have omitted many circumstances, which if rightly known would dispel this and many more difficulties that may be imagined in this transaction, does certainly furnish us with a better and more satisfactory answer. St Austin is of opinion, that God had not given the ass a reasonable foul; but permitted it to pronounce\nnounce certain words, in order to reprove the prophet's covetousness. Gregory of Nyssa seems to think that the afs did not utter any word articulately or distinctly; but that, having brayed as usual, the diviner, whose practice it had been to draw preludes from the cries of beasts and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SINGING\">singing</a> of birds, comprehended easily the afs's meaning by its noise; Moses, deigning to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> this superstitious art of augurs and footstaplers, as if the afs really spoke in words articulate.\n\nWe must own, says Calmet, that this is a miraculous fact related by an inspired writer, whose authority we are not allowed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> in question in the least particular: but we should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> such ways of explaining it as are most conformable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, and most proper to solve the difficulties of it, without attacking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>.

The ancient or Roman, called also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PATERA\">patera</a> Romana, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-YARD\">yard</a>, consists of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a> or beam, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> a centre, and suspended near one of its extremities; the bodies to be weighed are applied on one side of the centre; and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> is shown by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> marked on the beam, where the weight, which is moveable along the lever, keeps the steel-yard in equilibrium. This balance is still frequently used in weighing heavy bodies.\n\nThe modern balance now generally used consists of a lever or beam suspended exactly in the middle, having scales or basins hung to each extremity. The lever is called the jugum or beam; and the two moieties thereof on each side the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a>, the brachia or arms. The line on which the beam turns, or which divides its brachia, is called the axis; and when considered with regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of the brachia, is esteemed a point only, and called the centre of the balance; the handle whereby it is held, or by which the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> is suspended, is called trutina; and the slender <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to the beam, whereby either the equilibrium or preponderancy of bodies is indicated, is called the tongue of the balance. Thus in fig. 1. Pl. 84. ab is the beam, divided into two equal brachia or arms by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> spot in the centre, which is the axis or centre of the balance, and c is the tongue. The trutina, on which the axis is suspended, is not represented in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, in order to render the other parts more conspicuous.\n\nIt follows, from what has been observed, therefore,\nthat in the Roman balance, the weight used for a counterpoise is the same, but the point of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> varies; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> balance the counterpoise is various, and the point of application the same. The principle on which each is founded, may be very easily understood from the following observations, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> properties of the lever. See Lever.\n\nThe beam A B (fig. 2.), is a lever of the first kind; but instead of resting on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FULCRUM\">fulcrum</a>, is suspended by something fastened to its centre of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>: consequently the mechanism of the balance depends on the same theorems as the lever.\n\nHence as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of matter in a known weight is to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from the centre of motion, so is the distance of the unknown weight to its quantity of matter. Hence the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and use of the steel-yard is easily known. Let AB (fig. 2.) represent an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of this kind; a, the trutina, or handle on which the beam turns; k, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a> on which the balance may be suspended on a nail or hook; f, the hook on which the body to be weighed is hung; e, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLAR\">collar</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> by which the hook f is fastened to the beam; g, a moveable collar; b, a swivel; i, the counterpoise.\n\nFrom what has been said it evidently follows, that if the body to be weighed be fastened to the hook f, and the whole suspended by the ring k, the division on which the counterpoise is placed to maintain an equilibrium in the balance, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> show the weight of the body required; provided the weight of the counterpoise i be known, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> divisions, 1, 2, 3, &c., be equal to the distance between the centre of the balance and the screw which fastens the guard e to the shorter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> of the balance. It will also be necessary that the steel-yard itself, with its whole apparatus, exclusive of the counterpoise, be in equilibrium, when suspended on the ring k. If the body to be weighed be heavier than the divisions on the longer arm will indicate, the balance is turned the lower side upwards, and suspended on the other ring b; by which means the divisions become shorter, because the distance between the trutina d, and the screw on which the guard e moves, is less; the divisions in the figure on this side extending to 17, whereas they extend only to 6 on the other. It will be unnecessary perhaps to observe, that the same precaution, with regard to the centre of gravity when the balance is suspended, is also necessary when this side of the balance is used, as we before mentioned with regard to the other.\n\nWe have already observed, that in the common scales the two brachia or arms of the balance, e f, e g, fig. 3, are equal to each other, and consequently equal weights placed in the scales d, d, will be in equilibrium when the balance is suspended on its centre e, as in the figure, where the ring at the extremity of the trutina is hung on the tapering rod a b, fixed in the foot or base c.\n\nThe Deceitful Balance, or that which cheats by the inequality of its brachia, is founded on the same principle as the steel-yard. Let there be, for example, a balance so constructed, that both the brachia with their scales shall equiponderate, but that the length of the one arm shall be to that of the other as 10 to 9. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, a weight of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> pounds put into the longest arm, will counterpoise one of ten pounds put into the shorter one; but the cheat is immediately discovered by shifting the weight from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> to the other; in which case, the balance will no longer remain in equilibrium.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSAY\">Assay</a>-Balance, a very nice balance used in documentary operations, to determine exactly the weight of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> bodies; see fig. 4. This balance should be made of the best steel, and of the hardest kind; because that metal is not so easily spoiled with rust as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>; and it is more apt than any other to take a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> polish, which at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> prevents the rust.\n\nThe structure of the assayist's scale is little different from that of common scales, otherwise than by its nicety and smallness. The longer the beam of it is, the more exact may the weight of a body be found; however, 10 or 12 inches are sufficient length. Let the thickness of it be so little, that two drachms may hardly be hung at either of its extremities without its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a>; for the largest weight put upon it seldom exceeds one dram. The whole surface of this beam must be altogether without ornaments, which only increase the weight and gather dust, &c. The beam is suspended in a fork, the two legs of which are steel springs joined at top, but kept together below with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> plate clasp, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a>, and two lines and a half distant from each other. This clasp being taken off, and the legs of the fork being stretched out, the axis of the beam may be put into two holes made for that purpose at the ends of the legs, or be taken away from them. Let a very sharp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a> be fixed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the fork, standing perpendicularly downwards, if the fork is suspended, and so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, as that it may almost touch the top of the tongue of the beam put into the fork when in equilibrium. This needle is the mark of the equilibrium; and that the artists may be able to observe this, the legs of the fork must be broader in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and have an opening two or three lines wide; this fork may be adorned at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, provided the motion of the balance is not hindered by such ornaments: then take two scales made of thin plate of silver, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> and a half in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, hanging on three small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> strings, almost as long as the beam, tied together at top, with a silver hook in form of an S, and hang them to the extremities of the beam: a smaller silver <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISH\">dish</a> or blued steel, somewhat less than one inch in diameter, belongs to each of these scales. You first put into these dishes, with a pair of pincers, the bodies to be weighed, or with a spoon or a small shovel, when they are pounded, and then you put them into the scales; therefore the small dishes must be perfectly equal in weight. We use them, that bodies may be more conveniently put into and taken out of the scales, and that those which are vastly thin may not be bent or spoiled, and thence rendered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> by wiping.\n\nThis balance is suspended on a moveable brass or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> support, which consists of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEDESTAL\">pedestal</a>, and of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> set upon it about 20 inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, at the top of which comes out at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> an arm one inch long. At the extremity of this arm, put a small pulley three lines in diameter, another at the top of the column, and a third near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of it; all which pulleys must turn very easily on their axes. At the distance of one inch and a half below the upper arm, let another arm one inch and a half long come out of the column at right angles, having a hole through it two lines long, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of a line <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and placed perpendicularly...\npendicularly below the pulley of the upper arm, to receive a small plate, one inch and a half long; and of such breadth and thickness, as that it may freely move up and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, and yet not have too much play within the hole. This plate must also have a small hook at each extremity.\n\nAnd as such a balance will hardly stand still in the open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and becomes false when spoiled with dust, it must be put, together with its support, into a small case as represented in fig. 4, having glasses, \\(a\\), \\(a\\), at top, and all round it, that you may see what is within.\n\nManner of using the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLOY\">Alloy</a>-Balance.\u2014Pass a silk string over the three pulleys of the support, and tie it at its upper extremity to the small hook introduced into the hole of the inferior arm; then put the support in the middle of the small case, and pass the other extremity of the silk string below, through a hole bored in the middle of the lower part of the frame, containing the window in the fore-part of the case, and fasten it to a small weight of a cubic form. Suspend the fork of the balance on the inferior hook of the plate. By this means if you move backwards and forwards the weight fastened to the string, placed upon the top of the drawer jutting out beyond the fore-part of the case, the balance within is either lifted up or let down. But you must put the bodies to be weighed, and the weights themselves, into the small silver dishes; and these, when loaded, into the scales, through the side-windows, which must be opened for that purpose. When any thing is to be added to or taken out of them, you do it with the small pincers; or, if it is powder, with the small shovel or spoon; but you must let the balance down every time anything is to be added or taken away, that the scales may rest upon the bottom of the case; and thus the windows before the balance is lifted up again, especially if the air is not perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALM\">calm</a>.\n\nHydrostatic Balance, an instrument contrived to determine accurately the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> gravity of both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> and fluid bodies. It is constructed in various forms; but we shall content ourselves here with describing that which appears of all others the most accurate.\n\nVCG (fig. 5.) is the stand or pillar of this hydrostatic balance, which is to be fixed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>. From the top A hangs, by two silk strings, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> BB, from which it is suspended by a ring i, the fine beam of a balance b; which is prevented from descending too low on either side by the gently springing piece txyz, fixed on the support M. The harness is annulated at o, to show distinctly the perpendicular position of the examen, by the small pointed index fixed above it.\n\nThe strings by which the balance is suspended, passing over two pulleys, one on each side the piece at A, go down to the bottom on the other side, and are hung over the hook at v; which hook, by means of a screw P, is moveable about one inch and a quarter, backward and forward, and therefore the balance may be raised or depressed so much. But if a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> or depression be required, the sliding piece S, which carries the screw P, is readily moved to any part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> brass rod VK, and fixed by means of a screw.\n\nThe motion of the balance being thus adjusted, the rest of the apparatus is as follows. HH is a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOARD\">board</a>, fixed upon the piece D, under the scales d and e, and is moveable up and down in a low slit in the pillar above C, and fastened at any part by a screw behind. From the point in the middle of the bottom of each scale hangs, by a fine hook, a brass wire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AD\">ad</a> and ac. These pass through two holes mm in the table. To the wire ad is fastened a curious cylindrical wire r, perforated at each end for that purpose: this wire r is covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, graduated by equal divisions, and is about five inches long.\n\nIn the corner of the board at E, is fixed a brass tube, on which a round wire b l is adapted so as to move neither too tight nor too free, by its flat head I. Upon the lower part of this moves another tube Q, which has sufficient friction to make it remain in any position required: to this is fixed an index T, moving horizontally when the wire b l is turned about, and therefore may be easily set to the graduated wire r s. To the lower end of the wire r s hangs a weight L; and to that a wire pn, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> brass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> g about one-fourth of an inch diameter. On the other side, to the wire ac, hangs a large glass bubble R, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>.\n\nLet us first suppose the weight L taken away, and the wire pn suspended from S: and, on the other side, let the bubble R be taken away, and the weight F, suspended at c, in its room. This weight F we suppose to be sufficient to keep the several parts hanging to the other scale in equilibrium; at the same time that the middle point of the wire pn is at the surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> in the vessel N. The wire pn is to be of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, that the length of one inch shall weigh four grains.\n\nNow it is evident, since brass is eight times heavier than water, that for every inch the wire sinks in the water it will become half a grain lighter, and half a grain heavier for every inch it rises out of the water: consequently, by sinking two inches below the middle point, or rising two inches above it, the wire will become one grain lighter or heavier. Therefore, if, when the middle point is at the surface of the water in equilibrium, the index T be set to the middle point a of the graduated wire r s, and the distance on each side ar and ac contains 100 equal parts: then, if in weighing bodies the weight is required to the hundredth part of a grain, it may be easily had by proceeding in the following manner.\n\nLet the body to be weighed be placed in the scale d. Put the weight X in the scale e; and let this be so determined, that one grain more shall be too much, and one grain less too little. Then the balance being moved gently up or down, by the screw P, till the equilibrium be nicely shown at o; if the index T be at the middle point a of the wire r s, it shows that the weights put into the scale e are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> equal to the weight of the body. By this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> we find the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> weight of the body; the relative weight is found by weighing it hydrostatically in water, as follows.\n\nInstead of putting the body into the scale e, as before, let it hang with the weight F, at the hook c, by a horse-hair, as at R, supposing the vessel O of water were away. The equilibrium being then made, the index T standing between a and r, at the 36 division,\nBalancerion shows the weight of the body put in to be 1095.36 grains. As it thus hangs, let it be immersed in the water of the vessel O, and it will become much lighter: the scale will descend till the beam of the balance rest on the support Z. Then suppose 100 grams put into the scale before the equilibrium precisely, so that the index T stand at the 36 division above A; it is evident that the weight of an equal bulk of water would, in this case, be exactly 100 grams.\n\nAfter a like manner this balance may be applied to find the specific gravity of liquids, as is easy to conceive from what has been said.\n\nBalance of Trade. That which is commonly meant by the balance of trade, is the equal importing of foreign commodities with the exporting of the native. And it is reckoned that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> has the advantage in the balance of trade, which exports more of the native commodities, and imports less of the foreign. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> of this is, that, if the native commodities be of a greater value than are imported, the balance of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> must be made up in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BULLION\">bullion</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>; and the nation grows so much richer, as the balance of that account amounts to.\n\nBalance of a Clock, or Watch, is that part which regulates the beats.

As we arrive from the south we discover the city only at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> and a half, behind a hedge of trees, over the verdant tops of which appears a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> edging of domes and minarets. After an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>'s journey we reach these trees, which are very fine walnuts; and soon after, crossing some ill cultivated gardens, by winding paths, arrive at the entrance of the city. We there perceive a ruined wall, flanked with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> towers, which ascends the declivity to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, and traces the precincts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> city. This wall, which is only ten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> twelve feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, permits us to have a view of those void spaces and heaps of ruins which are the invariable appendage of every Turkish city; but what principally attracts our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> edifice on the left, which, by its lofty walls and rich columns, manifestly appears to be one of those temples which antiquity has left for our admiration. These ruins, which are some of the most beautiful and best preserved of any in Asia, merit a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>.\n\nTo give a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> idea of them, we must suppose ourselves descending from the interior of the town. After having crossed the rubbish and huts with which it is filled, we arrive at a vacant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> which appears to have been a square; there, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FRONT\">front</a>, towards the west, we perceive a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> ruin, which consists of two pavilions ornamented with pilasters, joined at their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> by a wall 160 feet in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>. This front commands the open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> from a fort of terrace, on the edge of which we distinguish with difficulty the bases of twelve columns, which formerly extended from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAVILION\">pavilion</a> to the other, and formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PORTICO\">portico</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> gate is obstructed by heaps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>; but, that obstacle surmounted, we enter an empty space, which is a hexagonal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of 180 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>. This court is fired with broken columns, mutilated capitals, and the remains of pilasters, entablatures, and cornices; around it is a row of ruined edifices, which display all the ornaments of the richest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>. At the end of this court, opposite the west, is an outlet, which formerly was a gate, through which we perceive a still more extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of ruins, whose magnificence strongly excites curiosity. To have a full prospect of these, we must ascend a slope, up which were the steps to this gate; and we then arrive at the entrance of a square court, much more spacious than the former, being 350 feet wide and 336 in length. The eye is first attracted by the end of this court, where six enormous and majestic columns render the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> astonishingly grand and picturesque. Another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> not less interesting is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> range of columns to the left, which appear to have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PERISTYLE\">peristyle</a> of a temple; but before we pass thither, we cannot refuse particular attention to the edifices which enclose this court on each side. They form a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GALLERY\">gallery</a>.\ngallery which contains various chambers, seven of which may be reckoned in each of the principal wings, viz. two in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a> and five in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> square. The bottom of these apartments still retains pediments of niches and tabernacles, the supports of which are destroyed. On the side of the court they are open, and present only four and six columns totally destroyed. It is not easy to conceive the use of these apartments; but this does not diminish our admiration at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of their pilasters and the richness of the frieze of the entablature. Neither is it possible to avoid remarking the singular effect which results from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of the garlands, the large foliage of the capitals, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a> of wild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> with which they are everywhere ornamented. In traversing the length of the court, we find in the middle a little square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESPLANADE\">esplanade</a>, where was a pavilion, of which nothing remains but the foundation. At length we arrive at the foot of the six columns; and then first conceive all the boldness of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> and the richness of their workmanship. Their shafts are 21 feet eight inches in circumference and 58 high; so that the total height, including the entablature, is from 71 to 72 feet. The sight of this superb ruin, thus solitary and unaccompanied, at first strikes us with astonishment; but, on a more attentive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, we discover a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of foundations, which mark an oblong square of 268 feet in length and 146 wide, and which, it seems probable, was the peristyle of a grand temple, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> purpose of this whole structure. It presented to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> court, that is to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a>, a front of ten columns, with 19 on each side, which, with the other six, make in all 54. The ground on which it stood was an oblong square, on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with this court, but narrower than it, so that there was only a terrace of 27 feet wide round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLONNADE\">colonnade</a>; the esplanade this produces fronts the open country toward the west, by a sloping wall of about 30 feet. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>, as you approach the city, becomes less steep, so that the foundation of the pavilion is on a level with the termination of the hill; whence it is evident that the whole ground of the courts has been artificially raised. Such was the former state of this edifice; but the southern side of the grand temple was afterwards blocked up to build a smaller one, the peristyle and walls of which are still remaining. This temple, situated somewhat lower than the other, presents a side of 13 columns by eight in front (in all 34), which are likewise of the Corinthian order; their shafts are 15 feet eight inches in circumference, and 44 in height. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> they surround is an oblong square, the front of which, turned towards the east, is out of the line of the left wing of the great court. To reach it you must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> trunks of columns, heaps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, and a ruinous wall by which it is now hid. After surmounting these obstacles you arrive at the gate, where you may survey the enclosure which was once the habitation of a god; but instead of the awful scene of a prostrate people and sacrifices offered by a multitude of priests, the sky is seen through the open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a>, which lets in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> to show a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAOS\">chaos</a> of ruins covered with dust and weeds. The walls, formerly enriched with all the ornaments of the Corinthian order, now present nothing but pediments of niches and tabernacles, of which almost all the supports are fallen to the ground. Between these niches is a range of fluted pilasters, whose capitals support a broken entablature; but what remains of it displays a rich frize of foliage resting on the heads of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATYRS\">satyrs</a>, horses, bulls, &c. Over this entablature was the ancient roof, which was 57 feet wide and 110 in length. The walls which supported it are 31 feet high, and without a window. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to form any idea of the ornaments of this roof, except from the fragments lying on the ground; but it could not have been richer than the gallery of the peristyle: the principal remaining parts contain tablets in the form of lozenges, on which are represented <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> seated on his eagle; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEDA\">Leda</a> carried by the swan; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIANA\">Diana</a> with her bow and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRESCENT\">crescent</a>; and several busts which seem to be figures of emperors and empresses. It would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us too far to enter more minutely into the description of this astonishing edifice. The lovers of the arts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> find it described with the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and accuracy in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> in 1757, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Ruins of Balbec. This work, compiled by Mr Robert Wood, the world owes to the attention and liberality of Mr Dawkins, who in 1757 visited Balbec and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PALMYRA\">Palmyra</a>. But several changes, however, have taken place since their journey; for example, they found <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> large columns standing, and in 1784 Mr Volney found but six. They reckoned 29 at the lesser temple, but there now remain but 20; the others have been overthrown by the earthquake of 1759. It has likewise shaken the walls of the lesser temple, that the stone of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SOFFIT\">soffit</a>, or cross stone at the top of the gate, has slid between the two adjoining ones, and descended eight inches; by which means the body of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> sculptured on that stone is suspended, detached from its wings and the two garlands which hang from its beak, and terminated in two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENII\">genii</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> alone has not effected this devastation; the Turks have had their share in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of the columns. Their motive is to procure the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> cramps, which serve to join the several blocks of which each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> is composed. These cramps answer so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> the end intended, that several of the columns are not even disjointed by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>; one, among others, as Mr Wood observes, has penetrated a stone of the temple wall without giving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>; nothing can surpass the workmanship of these columns; they are joined without any cement, yet there is not room for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLADE\">blade</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a> between their interstices. After so many ages, they in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> still retain their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> whiteness. But what is still more astonishing, is the enormous stones which compose the sloping wall. To the west the second layer is formed of stones which are from 28 to 35 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, by about nine in height. Over this layer, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west angle, there are three stones which alone occupy a space of 175\u00bd feet; viz. the first 58 feet seven inches, the second 58 feet 11, and the third exactly 58 feet; and each of these is 12 feet thick. These stones are of a white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a>, with large thinning flakes like gypsum; there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARRY\">quarry</a> of this kind of stone under the whole city and in the adjacent mountain, which is open in several places, and among others on the right, as we approach the city. There is still lying there a stone, hewn on three sides, which is 69 feet two inches long, 12 feet 10 inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and 13 feet three in thickness. By what means could the ancients move these enormous masses? This is doubt-\nBalbec, lefs a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a> curious to resolve. The inhabitants of Balbec have a very commodious manner of explaining it, by supposing these edifices to have been constructed by Dioneus, or genii, who obeyed the orders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">King</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a>; adding, that the motive of such immense works was to conceal in subterraneous caverns vast treasures, which still remain there. To discover these, many have descended into the vaults which range under the whole edifice: but the utility of their researches, added to the oppressions and exactions of the governors, who have made their supposed discoveries a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a>, have at length disheartened them; but they imagine the Europeans would be more successful, nor would it be possible to persuade them but that we are possessed of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGIC\">magic</a> art of destroying talismans. It is in vain to oppose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>: and it would be no less ridiculous to attempt to prove to them that Solomon never was acquainted with the Corinthian order, which was only in use under the Roman emperors. But their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> on the subject of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> may suggest three important observations. First, That all tradition relative to high antiquity is as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> among the Orientals as the Europeans. With them, as with us, facts which happened 100 years before, when not preserved in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, are altered, mutilated, or forgotten. To expect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> from them with respect to events in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> or Alexander, would be as absurd as to make inquiries of the Flemish peasants concerning Clovis or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLEMAGNE\">Charlemagne</a>. Secondly, That throughout Syria, the Mahometans, as well as the Jews and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> every great work to Solomon: not that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of him still remains by tradition in those countries, but from certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> in the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>; which, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOSPEL\">gospel</a>, is the source of almost all their tradition, as these are the only historical books read or known; but as their expounders are very ignorant, their applications of what they are told are generally very remote from truth. By an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of this kind they pretend Balbec is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of the forest of Lebanon built by Solomon: nor do they approach nearer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, when they attribute to that king the well of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRE\">Tyre</a> and the buildings of Palmyra. Thirdly, That the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> in hidden treasures has been confirmed by discoveries which have been really made from time to time. It is not many years since a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COFFIN\">coffin</a> was found at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEBRON\">Hebron</a> full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> and silver medals, with an ancient Arabic book on medicine. In the country of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRUSES\">Druses</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> discovered likewise, some time since, a jar with gold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-COIN\">coin</a> in the form of a crescent; but as the chiefs and governors claim a right to these discoveries, and ruin those who have made them, under pretext of obliging them to make reformation, those who find anything endeavour carefully to conceal it; they secretly melt the antique coins, nay frequently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> them again in the same place where they found them, from the same fears which caused their first concealment, and which prove the same tyranny formerly existed in these countries.\n\nWhen we consider the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> magnificence of the temple of Balbec, we cannot but be astonished at the silence of the Greek and Roman authors. Mr Wood, who has carefully examined all the ancient writers, has found no mention of it except in a fragment of John of Antioch, who attributes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of this edifice to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTONINUS_PIUS\">Antoninus Pius</a>. The inscriptions which remain corroborate this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, which perfectly accounts for the constant use of the Corinthian order, since that order was not in general use before the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of Rome; but we ought by no means to allege as an additional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> the bird sculptured over the gate; for if his crooked beak, large claws, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CADUCEUS\">caduceus</a> he bears, give him the appearance of an eagle, the tuft of feathers on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, like that of certain pigeons, proves that he is not the Roman eagle: besides that the same bird is found in the temple of Palmyra; and is therefore evidently an Oriental eagle, consecrated to the sun, who was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> adored in both these temples. His worship existed at Balbec in the most remote antiquity. His statue, which resembled that of Oliris, had been transported there from the Heliopolis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, and the ceremonies with which he was worshipped there have been described by Macrobius, in his curious work entitled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURNALIA\">Saturnalia</a>. Mr Wood supposes with reason, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Balbec, which in Syriac signifies City of Bal, or of the sun, originated in this worship. The Greeks, by naming it Heliopolis, have in this instance only given a literal translation of the oriental word: a practice to which they have not always adhered. We are ignorant of the state of this city in remote antiquity; but it is to be presumed, that its situation on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> from Tyre to Palmyra, gave it some part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> of these opulent capitals. Under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, in the time of Augustus, it is mentioned as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARRISON\">garrison</a> town; and there is still remaining, on the wall of the southern gate, on the right, as we enter, an inscription which proves the truth of this, the words KENTURIA PRIMA, in Greek characters, being very legible. One hundred and forty years after, Antoninus built there the present temple, instead of the ancient one, which was doubtless falling into ruins: but Christianity having gained the ascendancy under Constantine, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> temple was neglected, and afterwards converted into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>; a wall of which is now remaining, that hid the sanctuary of the idols. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> thus until the invasion of the Arabs, when it is probable they envied the Christians so beautiful a building. The church being less frequented fell to decay; wars succeeded; and it was converted into a place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>; battlements were built on the wall which surrounded it, on the pavilions and at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> which still subsist; and from that time, the temple, exposed to the fate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, fell rapidly to ruin. The state of the city is not less deplorable. The wretched <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the emirs of the house of Harfouche had already greatly impaired it, and the earthquake of 1739 completed its destruction. The wars of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMIR\">Emir</a> Youlef and Djezzar have rendered it still more deserted and ruinous. Of 5000 inhabitants, at which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> they were estimated in 1751, not 1200 are now remaining; and all these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, without industry or commerce, and cultivating nothing but a little cotton, some maize, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>-melons.","sp":399,"ep":401},{"h":"BALBINUS","t":"Decimus Coelius, the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>, being chosen by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> in 237, was assassinated by the soldiers, who had a dislike to such emperors as were elected only by the senators.

Baise was this place in the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>; its easy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with Rome was also a point of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>. Hither at first retired for a temporary relaxation the mighty rulers of the world, to stings anew their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a> and revive their spirits, fatigued with bloody campaigns and civil contests.

From being a place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> for a season, Baise now grew up to a permanent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>: whoever found himself disqualified by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> infirmity, for sustaining any longer an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>; whoever, from an indolent disposition, sought a place where the pleasures of a town were combined with the sweets of a rural life; whoever wished to withdraw from the dangerous neighbourhood of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, and the baneful eye of informers, flocked hither to enjoy life untainted with fear and trouble. Such influence of wealthy inhabitants rendered Baise as much a miracle of art as it was before of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; its splendour may be inferred from its innumerable ruins, heaps of marbles, mosaics, stucco, and other precious fragments of taff.\u2014It flourished in full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the days of Theodoric the Goth; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of these enchanted palaces followed quickly upon the irruption of the northern conquerors, who overturned the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, sacked and burnt all before them, and destroyed or dispersed the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>. Lots of fortune left the Romans neither the means, nor indeed the thought, of supporting such expensive establishments, which can only be enjoyed in perfection during peace and prosperity. No sooner had opulence withdrawn her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, than the unbridled sea rushed back upon its old domain; moles and buttresses were torn asunder and washed away; whole promontories, with the proud towers that once crowned their brows, were undermined and tumbled headlong into the deep, where, many feet below the surface, pavements of streets, foundations of houses, and masses of walls, may still be descried.

At 12 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> he was entered in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONASTERY\">monastery</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARMELITES\">Carmelites</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWICH\">Norwich</a>, and was thence sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>.

Soon after the accession of Edward VI. he was recalled; and being first presented to the living of Bishop's Stocke in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAMPSHIRE\">Hampshire</a>, in 1552, he was nominated to the see of Offory. During his residence in Ireland he was remarkably industrious in propagating the Protestant doctrines; but to very little purpose, and frequently at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAZARD\">hazard</a> of his life. Once, in particular, they murdered five of his domestics, who were making hay in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a> near his\nhis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>; and would probably have done the same by him, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KILKENNY\">Kilkenny</a> had not come to his assistance with 100 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> and 300 foot. On the accession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, the tide of opposition became so powerful, that, to avoid affiliation, he embarked for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, but was very unfortunate in his escape. First he was taken by a Dutch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, and robbed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a> of all his effects. Then, being forced by tempests of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> into St Ives's in Cornwall, he was confined on suspicion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a>. Being, however, released after a few days confinement, the ship anchored in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, where he was again seized on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a>. After his arrival in Holland, he was kept prisoner for three weeks, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> obtained his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> on paying 30l.

He died in November 1563, at Canterbury, in the 68th year of his age. He was so severe a writer against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Rome, that his books are particularly prohibited in the expurgatory index published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MADRID\">Madrid</a>, in folio, in the year 1667.

To make these balls, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of filings of iron and two parts powdered cream of tartar are mixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> together, and put into an earthen or iron vessel with some water. This mixture is to be stirred from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to time, till it becomes almost dry; and then it is to receive more water, and to be stirred as before. This treatment is to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till it acquires, when nearly dry, somewhat of the confluence and tenacity of softened rosin. Then it is rolled up in the form of a ball, which is generally kept tied up in rag; and when intended to be used, it is to be infused in water, till it gives some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> to that liquid. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFUSION\">infusion</a> of martial balls is tonic, vulnerary, diuretic, and aperitive; and is employed both internally and externally.

The preparations of fire-balls, among the moderns, consist of several operations, viz. making the bag, preparing the composition, tying, and, lastly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIPPING\">dipping</a> the ball. 1. The bags for this purpose are either oval or round. 2. The composition wherewith fire-balls are filled is various: To ten pounds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>-gunpowder add two of saltpetre, one of sulphur, and one of colophony; or to five pounds of gunpowder, add four of saltpetre, four of sulphur, one of powdered glass, half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a>, as much camphor, an ounce of sal-ammoniac, and four of common salt, all pulverised. Sometimes they even fill fire-balls with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> grenades. 3. For tying the fire-balls, they prepare two iron rings, one fitted round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a>,\nLight-Balls aperture, where the ball is to be lighted, the other near its base. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> is tied to these rings in such a manner, as that the several turns represent semicircles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> the globe through the poles; over the cords, extended according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of the ball, others are tied, cutting the former at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to each other, making a knot at each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERSECTION\">intersection</a>: lastly, after putting in a leaden bullet, the reft of the space is filled with tow or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>. 4. Thus completed, the fire-ball remains to be dipped in a composition of melted pitch four pounds, colophony two, and linseed oil or oil of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TURPENTINE\">turpentine</a> two; after dipping, they cover it round with tow, and dip again, till it be brought to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> required.\n\nLight-Balls, are such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a> an intense light around; or they are balls which, being cast out of the hand or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a>, burn for some time, and illuminate the adjacent parts. 1. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUMINOUS\">Luminous</a> or light-balls for the hand are made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> powder, saltpetre, brimstone, camphor, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BORAX\">borax</a>, all sprinkled with oil, and moulded into a mass with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>; and this is wrapped up in tow, with a sheet of strong paper over it. To fire it, they make a hole into it with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BODKIN\">bodkin</a>, into which they put some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMING\">priming</a> that will burn slow. Its use is to be cast into any works they would discover in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>-time. 2. For the larger light-balls, or those to be thrown to a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, they melt equal quantities of sulphur, turpentine, and pitch; and therein dip an earthen or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> ball, of a diameter much less than that of the mortar out of which the fire-ball is to be cast; then rolling it in gunpowder, and covering it round with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAUZE\">gauze</a>, they dip it again, and repeat the rest till it come to fit the cavity of the mortar: lastly, they sprinkle it around with gunpowder. This, being once kindled, will strongly illuminate all around the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where it is thrown, and give opportunity to examine the state and condition thereof.\n\nSmoke or Dark-Balls, those which fill the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> with smoke, and thus darken a place to prevent discoveries. To prepare a darkening ball, make an oval or spherical bag; melt rosin over the coals, and add an equal part of saltpetre not purified, also of sulphur, and a fifth part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a>. The whole being well incorporated, put in tow first shred, and fill the bags with this composition, and dip it after the same manner as a fire-ball.\n\nStink-Balls, those which yield a great stench when fired to annoy the enemy. Their preparation is thus: Melt ten pounds of pitch, six of rosin, twenty of saltpetre, eight of gunpowder, and four of colophony; to these add two of charcoal, six of horlic-roots cut small, three of asafoetida, one of stinking-fenacen, and any other offensive ingredients. The rest as in the former.\n\nSky-Balls, those cast on high out of mortars, and which, when arrived at their height, bursting like rockets, afford a spectacle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECORATION\">decoration</a>. Sky-balls are made of a wooden shell, filled with various compositions, particularly that of the stars of rockets. These are sometimes intermixed with crackers and other combustibles, making rains of fire, &c.\n\nWater-Balls, those which swim and burn a considerable time in the water, and at length burst therein. These are made in a wooden shell, the cavity of which is filled with refined saltpetre, sulphur, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>-dust boiled Land-Balls in water of saltpetre, and dried; to which sometimes other ingredients are added, as iron filings, Greek pitch, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a> dust, powdered glats, and camphor. The ingredients are to be ground, mixed up, and moistened with linseed oil, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol15.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> oil, olive oil, hempseed oil, or petrol. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> is placed an iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COFFIN\">coffin</a>, filled with whole gunpowder, that the ball may at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> burst with a greater noise: and, lastly, the ball is by the addition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> or otherwise, made of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> gravity with water.\n\nLand-Balls are those which, being thrown out of a mortar, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to the ground, burn, and burst there.

whilst her masts are more endangered by her sudden jerks and excessive labouring; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a>, she will be incapable of carrying sail, without the risk of overfetting.\n\nStiffness, in ballasting, is occasioned by disposing a great quantity of heavy ballast, as lead, iron, &c., in the bottom, which naturally places the centre of gravity very near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KEEL\">keel</a>; and that being the centre about\nwhich the vibrations are made, the lower it is placed, the more violent will be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of rolling.\n\nCranks, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, is occasioned by having too little ballast, or by disposing the ship's lading so as to raise the centre of gravity too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, which also endangers the main in carrying sail when it blows hard: for when the masts lose their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> height, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRAIN\">strain</a> on the shrouds in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a>, which increases as the sine of their obliquity; and a ship that loses her masts is in great danger of being lost.\n\nThe whole art of ballasting, therefore, consists in placing the centre of the gravity to correspond with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-TRIM\">trim</a> and shape of the vessel, so as neither to be too high nor too low; neither too far forward nor too far aft, and to make the ship deep, that the surface of the water may nearly rise to the extreme breadth amidships; and thus she will be enabled to carry a good sail, incline but little, and ply <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINDWARD\">windward</a>.\n\nShips are said to be in ballast when they have no other loading.

The ancient name of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> was, it is said, Bamborough; which name Camden, from the authority of Bede, imagines borrowed from Bebba, Ida's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>; but the author of the additions to that writer is of a contrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, as in the Saxon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> it is called Cynelcanberg, or the \"royal manion.\" According to Florilegus, King Ida at first fenced it only with a wooden enclosure, but afterwards surrounded it with a wall. It is thus described by Roger Hoveden, who wrote in the year 1192: \"Bebba is a very strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, but not exceeding large; containing not more than two or three acres of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>. It has but one hollow entrance into it, which is admirably raised by steps. On the top of the hill stands a fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>; and in the western point is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> curiously adorned, and of sweet clean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>.\" This castle was besieged anno 642 by Penda, the Pagan king of the Mercians, who, as the story goes, attempted to burn it: for which purpose he laid vast quantities of wood under the walls, and set fire to it as soon as the wind was favourable; but no sooner was it kindled, than by the prayers of St Adian, the wind changed and carried the flames into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>, so that he was obliged to raise the siege. In 710, King Offred, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Alfred his father, took shelter in this castle with Britthric his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">guardian</a>; one Edulph having seized the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, by whom, with his partizans, they were unsuccessfully besieged. Britthric made so gallant a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, that the siege was turned into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLOCKADE\">blockade</a>, which gave the loyal subjects <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> in defence of their young king. On their marching hither to his relief, Edulph fled; but was followed, taken, and put to death by Britthric, who thereby securely seated Offred on the throne, when this castle became his palace. In the reign of Egbert, Kenulph bishop of Lindisfarne was confined here 30 years from 750 to 780. In 933, it was plundered and totally ruined by the Danes; but being of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> importance in defending the northern parts against the continual incursions of the Scots, it was soon after repaired, and made a place of considerable strength. It is said to have been in good repair at the time of the Conquest, when it was probably put into the custody of some trusty Norman, and had in all likelihood some additions made to its works; and this is the more probable, as the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AREA\">area</a>, contained within its walls, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> upwards of 80 acres, instead of three, as when described by Hoveden. About the year 1095 it was in possession of Robert de Mowbray <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Northumberland, who engaging in some treasonable practices against William Rufus, that king laid siege to it, and obliged it to surrender. In the next reign it was intrusted by Henry I. to Luitace Fitz-John, who was dispossessed of it and his other employments by King Stephen, that king being jealous of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to Maud, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Henry I. Irritated at this, Fitz-John delivered the castle of Alnwick to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> king of Scotland, and brought to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> all the forces he could raise; he was, however, afterward reconciled to King Stephen, and held the manors of Burg and Knaresborough in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>, but never recovered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of this castle.\n\nIn the 16th of Henry II. some great repairs seem to have been done here, as in Madox's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the exchequer, under the article of Amercements, it appears one William, son of Waldef, was fined five marks for refusing his assistance in the king's works at Baenburg castle.","sp":412,"ep":412},{"h":"BAMBUCK","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, of which the Bambock, following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> is given by the Abb\u00e9 Raynal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> traveller whom he does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>. \"In the interior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Africa, under the 12th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 13th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>, there is (says a modern traveller) a pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> country, known by the name of Bambuck.

When the mine is very rich, it is dugged only to the depth of a few feet, and never deeper; though it has been observed, that the lower it was digged, the more gold the soil afforded. The miners are too indolent to pursue a toil which constantly becomes more tedious, and too ignorant to perceive the inconveniences it would be attended with. Their negligence and their folly are in this instance so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a>, that in washing the gold, in order to separate it from the earth, they only preserve the larger pieces: the light parts pass away with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, which flows <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCLINED_PLANE\">inclined <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>.\n\n\"The inhabitants of Bambuck do not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> at all times, nor are they at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to do it when they please.

It is remarkable only for its dreadful catastrophe when taken by Jenghiz Khan in 1221. At that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the city belonged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SULTAN\">Sultan</a> Jalalodin, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> of the famous Mahmud Gazni's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>.

In this, however, he was disappointed.

Accordingly,\nAccordingly, Jenghiz Khan having erected wooden towers, and planted his engines upon them, was in a short time obliged to give over his attacks till millstones and other materials could be brought from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>.

This exceedingly charmed Jenghiz Khan; who one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> returning from a fruitless attack, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> of the defeat of one of his generals by Jalaluddin, swore to be revenged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> Bamiyan.

The four castes are absolutely separate as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a>, relation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, &c., though all of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>; which is more properly denominated the religion of the Bramins, who make the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> tribe, than of the Banians, who make the mercantile. The proper Banians are called, in the fassler, or book of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, by the name of Shuddery; under which are comprehended all who live after the manner of merchants, or that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> and transact for others, as brokers; exclusive of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, or artificers, who make another caste, called Wyfe.

The company was incorporated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> in the fifth and sixth years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">King</a> William regulations, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, by the name of The Governors and Company of the Bank of England: in consideration of the loan of 1,200,000l. granted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>; for which the subscribers received almost 8 per cent. By this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a>, the company are not to borrow under their common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>, unless by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of parliament; they are not to trade, or suffer any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> in trust for them to trade, in any goods or merchandise; but they may deal in bills of exchange, in buying or selling bullion, and foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> and silver <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>, &c.\n\nBy an act of parliament passed in the 8th and 9th years of William III. they were empowered to enlarge their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> stock to 2,201,771l. 10s. It was then also enacted, that bank-stock should be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a>, and not a real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a>; that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> either in word or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> for buying or selling bank-stock, should be good in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, unless registered in the books of the bank within 7 days, and the stock transferred in 14 days; and that it shall be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FELONY\">felony</a>, without benefit of clergy, to counterfeit the common seal of the bank, or any sealed bank-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BILL\">bill</a>, or any bank-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, or to alter or erase such bills or notes. By another act passed in the 7th of Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>, the company were empowered to augment their capital to 4,402,343l. and they then advanced 400,000 more to the government; and in 1714, they advanced another loan of 1,500,000l.\n\nIn the third year of the reign of King George I. the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of their capital stock was reduced to 5 per cent. when the bank agreed to deliver up as many exchequer bills as amounted to 2,000,000l. and to accept an annuity of 100,000l. and it was declared lawful for the bank to call from their members, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to their interests in the capital stock, such sums of money as in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> should be found necessary. If any member should neglect to pay his share of the moneys so called for, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> appointed by notice in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAZETTE\">Gazette</a>, and fixed upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Exchange, it should be lawful for the bank, not only to stop the dividend of such member, and to apply it towards payment of the money in question, but also to stop the transfers of the share of such defaulter, and to charge him with an interest of 5 per cent. per annum, for the money so omitted to be paid; and if the principal and interest should be three months unpaid, the bank should then have power to sell so much of the stock belonging to the defaulter as would satisfy the same. After this, the bank reduced the interest of the 2,000,000l. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> to the government, from 5 to 4 per cent. and purchased several other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANNUITIES\">annuities</a>, which were afterwards redeemed by the government, and the national debt due to the bank reduced to 1,600,000l. But in 1742, the company engaged to supply the government with 1,600,000l. at 3 per cent. which is now called the 3 per cent. annuities; so that the government was now indebted to the company 3,200,000l. the one half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> 4, and the other 3 per cent.\n\nIn the year 1746, the company agreed that the sum of 986,800l. due to them in the exchequer bills unsatisfied, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the duties for licenses to sell spirituous liquors by retail, should be cancelled, and in lieu thereof to accept of an annuity of 39,442l. the interest of that sum at 4 per cent. The company also agreed to advance the further sum of 1,000,000l. into the exchequer, upon the credit of the duties arising by the malt and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a> tax at 4 per cent. for exchequer bills to be issued for that purpose; in consideration of which, the company were enabled to augment their capital with 986,800l. the interest of which, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as that of the other annuities, was reduced to 3\u00bd per cent. till the 26th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1757, and from that time to carry only 3 per cent.\n\nAnd in order to enable them to circulate the said exchequer bills, they established what is now called bank circulation. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of which may be understood from what follows.\n\nThe company of the bank are obliged to keep cash sufficient not only to answer the common, but also any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> demand that may be made upon them; and whatever money they have by them, over and above the sum imposed necessary for these purposes, they employ in what may be called the trade of the company; that is to say, in discounting bills of exchange, in buying of gold and silver, and in government securities, &c. But when the bank entered into the above mentioned contract, as they did not keep unemployed a larger sum of money than what they deemed necessary to answer their ordinary and extraordinary demands, they could not conveniently take out of their current cash so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> a sum as a million, with which they were obliged to furnish the government, without either lessening that sum they employed in discounting, buying gold and silver, &c. (which would have been very disadvantageous to them), or inventing some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> that should answer all the purposes of keeping the million in cash. The method which they chose, and which fully answers their end, was as follows:\n\nThey opened a subscription, which they renew annually, for a million of money; wherein the subscribers advance 10 per cent. and enter into a contract to pay the remainder, or any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> thereof, whenever the bank shall call upon them, under penalty of forfeiting the 10 per cent. so advanced; in consideration of which, the bank pays the subscribers 4 per cent. interest for the\nthe money paid in, and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) per cent. for the whole sum they agree to furnish; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> a call shall be made upon them for the whole, or any part thereof, the bank further agrees to pay them at the rate of \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\) per cent. per annum for such sum till they repay it, which they are under an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLIGATION\">obligation</a> to do at the end of the year. By this means the bank obtains all the purposes of keeping a million of money by them; and though the subscribers, if no call is made upon them (which is in general the case), receive \\( \\frac{6}{4} \\) per cent. for the money they advance, yet the company gains the sum of \\( 23,500 \\) per annum by the contract; as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> appear by the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>:\n\nThe bank receives from the government for the advance of a million \\( \u00a330,000 \\)\n\nThe bank pays the subscribers who advance \\( 100,000l. \\) and engage to pay (when called for) \\( 900,000l. \\) more\n\n\\( 6,500 \\)\n\nThe clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> to the bank thereof is \\( 23,500 \\)\n\nThis is the state of the case, provided the company should make no call on the subscribers; which they will be very unwilling to do, because it would not only lessen their profit, but affect the public credit in general.\n\nBank-stock may not improperly be called a trading stock, since with this they deal very largely in foreign gold and silver, in discounting bills of exchange, &c. Besides which, they are allowed by the government very considerable sums annually for the management of the annuities paid at their office. All which advantages render a share in their stock very valuable; though it is not equal in value to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">East</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> stock. The company make dividends of the profits half yearly, of which notice is publicly given; when those who have occasion for their money may readily receive it; but private persons, if they judge convenient, are permitted to continue their funds, and to have their interest added to the principal.\n\nThis company is under the direction of a governor, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a>-governor, and 24 directors, who are annually elected by the general court, in the same manner as in the East India Company. Thirteen, or more, compose a court of directors for managing the affairs of the company. The officers of this company are very numerous.\n\nThe stability of the bank of England is equal to that of the British government. All that it has advanced to the public must be lost before its creditors can sustain any loss. No other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANKING\">banking</a> company in England can be established by act of parliament, or can consist of more than five members. It acts, not only as an ordinary bank, but (as we have already seen) as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> engine of state; receiving and paying the greater part of the annuities which are due to the creditors of the public; circulating exchequer bills; and advancing to government the annual amount of the land and malt taxes, which are frequently not paid up till some years thereafter. It likewise has, upon several different occasions, supported the credit of the principal houses, not only in England, but of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAMBURG\">Hamburg</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>. Upon one occasion it is said to have advanced for this purpose, in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, about \\( 1,600,000l. \\) a great part of it in bullion.\n\nIn Scotland there are two public banks, both at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>. The one, called The Bank of Scotland, was established by act of parliament in 1695; the other, called The Royal Bank, by royal charter in 1727.\n\nWithin these 30 years there have also been erected private banking companies in almost every considerable town, and even in some villages. Hence the business of the country is almost entirely carried on by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> currency, i.e., by the notes of those different banking companies; with which purchases and payments of all kinds are commonly made. Silver very seldom appears, except in the change of a twenty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a> bank-note, and gold still seldom. But though the conduct of all those different companies has not been unexceptionable, and has accordingly required an act of parliament to regulate it; the country, notwithstanding, has evidently derived great benefit from their trade. It has been asserted, that the trade of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Glasgow doubled in about 15 years after the first erection of the banks there; and that the trade of Scotland has more than quadrupled since the first erection of the two public banks at Edinburgh. Whether the trade, either of Scotland in general, or of the city of Glasgow in particular, has really increased in so great a proportion, during so short a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, we do not pretend to know. If either of them has increased in this proportion, it seems to be an effect too great to be accounted for by the sole operation of this cause. That the trade and industry of Scotland, however, have increased very considerably during this period, and that the banks have contributed a good deal to this increase, cannot be doubted.\n\nThe value of the silver money which circulated in Smith's Scotland before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNION\">Union</a> in 1707, and which immediately after it was brought into the bank of Scotland Nations, in order to be recoined, amounted to \\( 411,117l. 10s. 9d. \\) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>. No account has been got of the gold coin; but it appears from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> accounts of the mint of Scotland, that the value of the gold annually coined somewhat exceeded that of the silver. There were a good many people too upon this occasion, who, from a diffidence of repayment, did not bring their silver into the bank of Scotland; and there was, besides, some English coin, which was not called in. The whole value of the gold and silver, therefore, which circulated in Scotland before the Union, cannot be estimated at less than a million Sterling. It seems to have constituted almost the whole circulation of that country; for though the circulation of the bank of Scotland, which had then no rival, was considerable, it seems to have made but a very small part of the whole. In the present times, the whole circulation of Scotland cannot be estimated at less than two millions, of which that part which consists of gold and silver most probably does not amount to half a million. But though the circulating gold and silver of Scotland have suffered to great a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> during this period, its real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> and prosperity do not appear to have suffered any. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, manufactures, and trade, on the contrary, the annual produce of its land and labour, have evidently been augmented.\n\nIt is chiefly by discounting bills of exchange, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCOUNT\">Discount</a> is, by advancing money upon them before they are due, that the greater part of banks and bankers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> their promissory notes. They deduct always upon whatever\never sum they advance, the legal interest till the bill shall become due. The payment of the bill, when it becomes due, replaces to the bank the value of what had been advanced, together with a clear profit of the interest. The banker, who advances to the merchant whose bill he discounts not gold and silver, but his own promissory notes, has the advantage of being able to discount to a greater amount, by the whole value of his promissory notes, which he finds by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> are commonly in circulation. He is thereby enabled to make his clear gain of interest on so much larger a sum.\n\nThe commerce of Scotland, which at present is not very great, was still more inconsiderable when the two first banking companies were established; and those companies would have had but little trade, had they confined their business to the discounting of bills of exchange. They invented, therefore, another method of issuing their promissory notes, by granting what they called cash accounts; that is, by giving credit to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of a certain sum (200l. or 300l. for example), to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> who could procure two persons of undoubted credit and good landed estate to become surety for him, that whatever money should be advanced to him within the sum for which the credit had been given should be repaid upon demand, together with the legal interest. Credits of this kind are commonly granted by banks and bankers in all different parts of the world. But the easy terms on which the Scots banking companies accept of repayment are peculiar to them, and have perhaps been the principal cause, both of the great trade of those companies and of the benefit which the country has received from it.\n\nWhoever has a credit of this kind with one of those companies, and borrows 100l. upon it, for example, may repay this sum piecemeal, by 20l. and 30l. at a time, the company discounting a proportionate part of the interest of the great sum from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> on which each of those small sums is paid in, till the whole be in this manner repaid. All merchants, therefore, and almost all men of business, find it convenient to keep such cash-accounts with them; and are thereby interested to promote the trade of those companies, by readily receiving their notes in all payments, and by encouraging all those with whom they have any influence to do the same. The banks, when their customers apply to them for money, generally advance it to them in their own promissory notes. These the merchants pay away to the manufacturers for goods, the manufacturers to the farmers for materials and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, the farmers to their landlords for rent, the landlords repay them to the merchants for the conveniences and luxuries with which they supply them, and the merchants again return them to the banks in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> their cash-accounts, or to replace what they may have borrowed of them; and thus almost the whole money-business of the country is transacted by means of them. Hence the great trade of those companies.\n\nBy means of those cash-accounts, every merchant can, without imprudence, carry on a greater trade than he otherwise could do. If there are two merchants, one in London and the other in Edinburgh, who employ equal stocks in the same branch of trade, the Edinburgh merchant can, without imprudence, carry on a greater trade, and give employment to a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of people, than the London merchant. The London merchant must always keep by him a considerable sum of money, either in his own coffers, or in those of his banker (who gives him no interest for it), in order to answer the demands continually coming upon him for payment of the goods which he purchases upon credit. Let the ordinary amount of this sum be supposed 500l. The value of the goods in his warehouse must always be less by 500l. than it would have been, had he not been obliged to keep such a sum unemployed. Let us suppose that he generally disposes of his whole stock upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, or of goods to the value of his whole stock upon hand, once in the year. By being obliged to keep such a great sum unemployed, he must sell in a year 500l. worth less goods than he might otherwise have done. His annual profits must be less by all that he could have made by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of 500l. worth more goods; and the number of people employed in preparing his goods for the market, must be less by all those that 500l. more stock could have employed. The merchant in Edinburgh, on the other hand, keeps no money unemployed for answering such occasional demands. When they actually come upon him, he satisfies them from his cash-account with the bank, and gradually replaces the sum borrowed with the money or paper which comes in from the occasional sales of his goods. With the same stock, therefore, he can, without imprudence, have at all times in his warehouse a larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of goods than the London merchant; and can thereby both make a greater profit himself, and give constant employment to a greater number of industrious people who prepare those goods for the market. Hence the great benefit which the country has derived from this trade.\n\nThe late multiplication of banking companies in both parts of the united <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, an event by which many people have been much alarmed, instead of diminishing, increases the security of the public. It obliges all of them to be more circumspect in their conduct, and, by not extending their currency beyond its due proportion to their cash, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> themselves against those malicious runs which the rivalryship of so many competitors is always ready to bring upon them. It restrains the circulation of each particular company within a narrower circle, and reduces their circulating notes to a smaller number. By dividing the whole circulation into a greater number of parts, the failure of any one company, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a> which, in the course of things, must sometimes happen, becomes of less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to the public. This free competition too obliges all bankers to be more liberal in their dealings with their customers, lest their rivals should carry them away. In general, if any branch of trade, or any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of labour, be advantageous to the public, the freer and more general the competition, it will always be the more so. See further, the article Paper-money.\n\n2. The other kind of banks consist of such as are instituted wholly on the public account, and are called deposit. Banks of Deposit; the nature of which not being generally understood, the following particular explanation may not be unacceptable.\n\nThe currency of a great state, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, generally\ngenerally consists almost entirely of its own coin. Should this currency, therefore, be at any time worn, clipped, or otherwise degraded below its standard value, the state by a reformation of its coin can effectually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-establish its currency. But the currency of a small state, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENOA\">Genoa</a> or Hamburg, can seldom consist altogether in its own coin, but must be made up, in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, of the coins of all the neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> with which its inhabitants have a continual intercourse. Such a state, therefore, by reforming its coin, will not always be able to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> its currency. If foreign bills of exchange are paid in this currency, the uncertain value of any sum, of what is in its own nature so uncertain, must render the exchange always very much against such a state, its currency being, in all foreign states, necessarily valued even below what it is worth.\n\nIn order to remedy the inconvenience to which this disadvantageous exchange must have subjected their merchants, such small states, when they began to attend to the interest of trade, have frequently enacted, that foreign bills of exchange of a certain value should be paid, not in common currency, but by an order upon, or by a transfer in, the books of a certain bank, established upon the credit and under the protection of the state; this bank being always obliged to pay, in good and true money, exactly according to the standard of the state. The banks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>, Genoa, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a>, Hamburg, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUREMBERG\">Nuremberg</a>, seem to have been all originally established with this view, though some of them may have afterwards been made subservient to other purposes. The money of such banks, being better than the common currency of the country, necessarily bore an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-AGIO\">agio</a>, which was greater or smaller, according as the currency was supposed to be more or less degraded below the standard of the state. The agio of the bank of Hamburg, for example, which is said to be commonly about 14 per cent., is the supposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the good standard money of the state, and the clipped, worn, and diminished currency poured into it from all the neighbouring states.\n\nBefore 1659, the great quantity of clipped and worn foreign coin, which the extensive trade of Amsterdam brought from all parts of Europe, reduced the value of its currency about 9 per cent. below that of good money fresh from the mint. Such money no sooner appeared, that it was melted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> or carried away, as it always is in such circumstances. The merchants, with plenty of currency, could not always find a sufficient quantity of good money to pay their bills of exchange; and the value of those bills, in spite of several regulations which were made to prevent it, became in a great measure uncertain. In order to remedy these inconveniences, a bank was established in 1659 under the guarantee of the city. The bank received both foreign coin, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and worn coin of the country, at its real and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> value in the good standard money of the country, deducting only so much as was necessary for defraying the expense of coining, and other necessary expense of management. For the value which remained after this small deduction was made, it gave a credit in its books. This credit was called bank-money; which, as it represented money exactly according to the standard of the mint, was always of the same real value, and intrinsically worth more than current money. It was at the same time enacted, that all bills drawn upon or negociated at Amsterdam of the value of 600 guilders and upwards should be paid in bank-money, which at once took away all uncertainty in the value of those bills. Every merchant, in consequence of this regulation, was obliged to keep an account with the bank in order to pay his foreign bills of exchange, which necessarily occasioned a certain demand for bank-money.\n\nBank-money, over and above both its intrinsic superiority to currency, and the additional value which this demand necessarily gives it, has likewise some other advantages. It is secure from fire, robbery, and other accidents; the city of Amsterdam is bound for it; it can be paid away by a simple transfer, without the trouble of counting, or the risk of transporting it from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> to another. In consequence of these different advantages, it seems from the beginning to have borne an agio; and it is generally believed that all the money originally deposited in the bank was allowed to remain there, nobody caring to demand payment of a debt which he could sell for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREMIUM\">premium</a> in the market. Besides, this money could not be brought from those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COFFER\">coffer</a>, as it will appear by and by, without previously paying for the keeping.\n\nThose deposits of coin, or which the bank was bound to restore in coin, constituted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> capital of the bank, or the whole value of what was represented by what is called bank-money. At present they are supposed to constitute but a very small part of it. In order to facilitate the trade in bullion, the bank has been for these many years in the practice of giving credit in its books upon deposits of gold and silver bullion. This credit is generally about 5 per cent. below the mint price of such bullion. The bank grants at the same time what is called a receipt or receipt, entitling the person who makes the deposit, or the bearer, to take out the bullion again at any time within six months, upon re-transferring to the bank a quantity of bank-money equal to that for which credit had been given in its books when the deposit was made, and upon paying \u00bd per cent. for the keeping if the deposit was in silver, and \u00bc per cent. if it was in gold; but at the same time declaring, that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFAULT\">default</a> of such payment, and upon the expiration of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, the deposit should belong to the bank at the price at which it had been received, or for which credit had been given in the transfer books. What is thus paid for the keeping of the deposit may be considered as a sort of warehouse-rent; and why this warehouse-rent should be so much dearer for gold than for silver, several different reasons have been assigned. The fineness of gold, it has been said, is more difficult to be ascertained than that of silver. Frauds are more easily practised, and occasion a greater loss in the more precious metal. Silver, besides, being the standard metal, the state, it has been said, wishes to encourage more the making of deposits of silver than those of gold.\n\nDeposits of bullion are most commonly made when the price is somewhat lower than ordinary; and they are taken out again when it happens to rise. In Holland the market price of bullion is generally above the mint price, for the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> that it was so in England before the late reformation of the gold coin. The difference is said to be commonly from about five to fifteen...\nsixteen flivers upon the mark, or eight ounces of silver of eleven parts fine and one part <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLOY\">alloy</a>. The bank-price, or the credit which the bank gives for deposits of such silver (when made in foreign coin, of which the fineness is well known and ascertained, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a> dollars), is 22 gilders the mark; the mint-price is about 23 gilders; and the market-price is from 23 gilders five flivers to 23 gilders ten flivers, or from 2 to 3 per cent. above the mint-price. The proportions between the bank-price, the mint-price, and the market-price, of gold bullion, are nearly the same. A person can generally tell his receipt for the difference between the mint-price of bullion and the market-price. A receipt for bullion is almost always worth something; and it very seldom happens, therefore, that anybody suffers his receipt to expire, or allows his bullion to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to the bank at the price at which it had been received, either by not taking it out before the end of the six months, or by neglecting to pay the 1/4 or 1/2 per cent. in order to obtain a new receipt for another six months. This, however, though it seldom happens, is said to happen sometimes, and more frequently with regard to gold than with regard to silver, on account of the higher warehouse-rent which is paid for the keeping of the more precious metal.\n\nThe person who by making a deposit of bullion obtains both a bank-credit and a receipt, pays his bills of exchange as they become due with his bank-credit; and either sells or keeps his receipt, according as he judges that the price of bullion is likely to rise or to fall. The receipt and the bank-credit seldom keep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> together, and there is no occasion that they should. The person who has a receipt, and who wants to take out bullion, finds always plenty of bank-credits, or bank-money, to buy at the ordinary price; and the person who has bank-money, and wants to take out bullion, finds receipts always in equal abundance.\n\nThe owners of bank-credits and the holders of receipts constitute two different sorts of creditors against the bank. The holder of a receipt cannot draw out the bullion for which it is granted, without re-affirming to the bank a sum of bank-money equal to the price at which the bullion had been received. If he has no bank-money of his own, he must purchase it of those who have it. The owner of bank-money cannot draw out bullion without producing to the bank receipts for the quantity which he wants. If he has none of his own, he must buy them of those who have them. The holder of a receipt, when he purchases bank-money, purchases the power of taking out a quantity of bullion, of which the mint-price is 5 per cent. above the bank-price. The agio of 5 per cent., therefore, which he commonly pays for it, is paid, not for an imaginary, but for a real value. The owner of bank-money, when he purchases a receipt, purchases the power of taking out a quantity of bullion, of which the market-price is commonly from 2 to 3 per cent. above the mint-price. The price which he pays for it, therefore, is paid likewise for a real value. The price of the receipt, and the price of the bank-money, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> or make up between them the full value or price of the bullion.\n\nUpon deposits of the coin current in the country, the bank grants receipts likewise as well as bank-credits; but those receipts are frequently of no value, and will bring no price in the market. Upon ducatoons, for example, which in the currency pass for three gilders three flivers each, the bank gives a credit of three gilders only, or 5 per cent. below their current value. It grants a receipt likewise entitling the bearer to take out the number of ducatoons deposited at any time within six months, upon paying 1/4 per cent. for the keeping. This receipt will frequently bring no price in the market. Three gilders bank-money generally fell in the market for three gilders three flivers, the full value of the ducatoons if they were taken out of the bank; and before they can be taken out; 1/4 per cent. must be paid for the keeping, which would be mere loss to the holder of the receipt. If the agio of the bank, however, should at any time fall to 3 per cent., such receipts might bring some price in the market, and might sell for 1 1/2 per cent. But the agio of the bank being now generally about 5 per cent. such receipts are frequently allowed to expire, or, as they express it, to fall to the bank. The 5 per cent. which the bank gains, when deposits either of coin or bullion are allowed to fall to it, may be considered as the warehouse rent for the perpetual keeping of such deposits.\n\nThe sum of bank-money for which the receipts are expired must be very considerable. It must comprehend the whole original capital of the bank, which, it is generally supposed, has been allowed to remain there from the time it was first deposited, nobody caring either to renew his receipt or to take out his deposit, as, for the reasons already assigned, neither the one nor the other could be done without loss. But whatever may be the amount of this sum, the proportion which it bears to the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of bank-money is supposed to be very small. The bank of Amsterdam has for these many years past been the great warehouse of Europe for bullion, for which the receipts are very seldom allowed to expire, or, as they express it, to fall to the bank. The far greater part of the bank-money, or of the credits upon the books of the bank, is supposed to have been created, for these many years past, by such deposits which the dealers in bullion are continually both making and withdrawing.\n\nNo demand can be made upon the bank but by means of a receipt or receipt. The smaller mass of bank-money, for which the receipts are expired, is mixed and confounded with the much greater mass for which they are still in force; so that, though there may be a considerable sum of bank-money for which there are no receipts, there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> sum or portion of it which may not at any time be demanded by one. The bank cannot be debtor to two persons for the same thing; and the owner of bank-money who has no receipt cannot demand payment of the bank till he buys one. In ordinary and quiet times, he can find no difficulty in getting one to buy at the market-price, which generally corresponds with the price at what he can sell the coin or bullion it entitles him to take out of the bank.\n\nIt might be otherwise during a public calamity: an invasion, for example, such as that of the French in 1672. The owners of bank-money being then all eager to draw it out of the bank, in order to have it in their own keeping, the demand for receipts might raise their price to an exorbitant height. The holders of them\nBank might form extravagant expectations, and instead of 2 or 5 per cent. demand half the bank-money for which credit had been given upon the deposits that the receipts had respectively been granted for. The enemy, informed of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the bank, might even buy them up in order to prevent the carrying away of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a>. In such emergencies, the bank, it is supposed, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> through its ordinary rule of making payment only to the holders of receipts. The holders of receipts, who had no bank-money, must have received within 2 or 3 per cent. of the value of the deposit for which their respective receipts had been granted. The bank, therefore, it is said, would in this case make no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SCRUPLE\">scruple</a> of paying, either with money or bullion, the full value of what the owners of bank-money who could get no receipts were credited for in its books; paying at the same time 2 or 3 per cent. to such holders of receipts as had no bank-money, that being the whole value which in this state of things could justly be supposed due to them.\n\nEven in ordinary and quiet times it is the interest of the holders of receipts to depress the agio, in order either to buy bank-money (and consequently the bullion which their receipts would then enable them to take out of the bank) so much cheaper, or to sell their receipts to those who have bank-money, and who want to take out bullion, so much dearer; the price of a receipt being generally equal to the difference between the market-price of bank-money and that of the coin or bullion for which the receipt had been granted. It is the interest of the owners of bank-money, on the contrary, to raise the agio, in order either to sell their bank-money so much dearer, or to buy a receipt so much cheaper. To prevent the stock-jobbing tricks which those opposite interests might sometimes occasion, the bank has of late years come to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to sell at all times bank-money for currency, at 5 per cent. agio, and to buy it again at 4 per cent. agio. In consequence of this resolution, the agio can never either rise above 5 or sink below 4 per cent., and the proportion between the market-price of the bank and that of current money is kept at all times very near to the proportion between their intrinsic values. Before this resolution was taken, the market-price of money used sometimes to rise to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as 9 per cent. agio, and sometimes to sink so low as par, according as opposite interests happened to influence the market.\n\nThe bank of Amsterdam professes to lend out no part of what is deposited with it, but, for every gilder for which it gives credit in its books, to keep in its repositories the value of a gilder either in money or bullion. That it keeps in its repositories all the money or bullion for which there are receipts in force, for which it is at all times liable to be called upon, and which, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>, is continually going from it and returning to it again, cannot well be doubted. But whether it does so likewise with regard to that part of its capital for which the receipts are long ago expired, for which in ordinary and quiet times it cannot be called upon, and which in reality is very likely to remain with it forever, or as long as the States of the United Provinces subsist, may appear perhaps more uncertain. At Amsterdam, however, no part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> is better established, than that for every gilder circulated as bank-money there is a correspondent gilder in gold and silver to be found in the treasure of the bank. The city is guaranteed that it should be so. The bank is under the direction of the four reigning burgomasters, who are changed every year. Each new set of burgomasters visits the treasure, compares it with the books, receives it upon oath, and delivers it over, with the same awful solemnity, to the set which succeeds it; and in that sober and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> country oaths are not yet disregarded. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> of this kind seems alone a sufficient security against any practices which cannot be avowed. Amidst all the revolutions which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a> has ever occasioned in the government of Amsterdam, the prevailing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> has at no time accused their predecessors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDELITY\">infidelity</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a> of the bank. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a> could have affected more deeply the reputation and fortune of the disgraced party; and if such an accusation could have been supported, we may be assured that it would have been brought. In 1672, when the French king was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UTRECHT\">Utrecht</a>, the bank of Amsterdam paid to readily as left no doubt of the fidelity with which it had observed its engagements. Some of the pieces which were then brought from its repositories appeared to have been scorched with the fire which happened in the town-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> soon after the bank was established. Those pieces, therefore, must have lain there from that time.\n\nWhat may be the amount of the treasure in the bank is a question which has long employed the speculations of the curious. Nothing but conjecture can be offered concerning it. It is generally reckoned, that there are about 2000 people who keep accounts with the bank; and allowing them to have, one with another, the value of 1500l. lying upon their respective accounts (a very large allowance), the whole quantity of bank-money, and consequently of treasure in the bank, will amount to 3,000,000l. or, at 11 gilders the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> Sterling, 33,000,000 of gilders; a great sum, and sufficient to carry on a very extensive circulation, but vastly below the extravagant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> which some people have formed of this treasure.\n\nThe city of Amsterdam derives a considerable revenue from the bank. Besides what may be called the warehousrent above-mentioned, each person, upon first opening an account with the bank, pays a fee of 10 gilders; and for every new account, 3 gilders 3 florins; for every transfer, 2 florins; and if the transfer is for less than 300 gilders, 6 florins; in order to discourage the multiplicity of small transactions. The person who neglects to balance his accounts twice in the year forfeits 25 gilders. The person who orders a transfer for more than is upon his account, is obliged to pay 3 per cent. for the sum overdraft, and his order is set aside into the bargain. The bank is supposed, too, to make a considerable profit by the sale of the foreign coin or bullion which sometimes falls to it by the expiring of receipts, and which is always kept till it can be sold with advantage. It makes a profit likewise by selling bank-money at 5 per cent. agio, and buying it in at 4. These different emoluments amount to a good deal more than what is necessary for paying the salaries of officers, and defraying the expense of management. What is paid for the keeping of bullion upon receipts, is alone supposed to amount to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> annual revenue of between 150,000 and 200,000 gilders. Public utility, however, and not revenue, was the original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of this\nBANK\n\nBanker's object was to relieve the merchants from the inconvenience of a disadvantageous exchange. The revenue which has arisen from it was unforeseen, and may be considered as accidental.\n\nBank, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> affairs, denotes an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the sea, so as sometimes to surmount the surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, or at least to leave the water so shallow as usually not to allow a vessel to remain afloat over it.\u2014In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, bank amounts to much the same as flat, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHOAL\">shoal</a>, &c.

But a bankrupt with us, from the several descriptions given of him in our statute-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, may be defined \"a trader, who feigns himself, or does certain acts tending to defraud his creditors.\" For the better understanding of this article, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be proper to consider, 1. Who may become a bankrupt. 2. What acts make a bankrupt. 3. The proceedings <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of bankruptcy: and, 4. In what manner an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> in goods and chattels may be transferred by bankruptcy. \u2014But of these, the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> being treated under the article Commission of Bankruptcy, the two first only belong to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>.\n\n1. A bankrupt was formerly considered merely in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of a criminal or offender; and in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> we are told by Sir Edward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COKE\">Coke</a>, that we have fetched as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, as the wickedness, of bankrupts from foreign nations. But at present the laws of bankruptcy are considered as laws calculated for the benefit of trade, and founded on the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> as well as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>; and to that end they confer some privileges not only on the creditors, but also on the bankrupt or debtor himself. On the creditors; by compelling the bankrupt to give up all his effects to their use, without any fraudulent concealment: on the debtor, by exempting him from the rigour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> law, whereby his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> might be confined at the discretion of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDITOR\">creditor</a>, though in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> he has nothing to satisfy the debt; whereas the law of bankrupts, taking into consideration the sudden and unavoidable accidents to which men in trade are liable, has given them the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of their persons, and some pecuniary emoluments, upon condition they surrender up their whole estate to be divided among their creditors.\n\nIn this respect our legislature seems to have attended to the example of the Roman law. We <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> not the Blackstone law of the twelve tables, whereby the creditors Comm. II. might cut the debtor's body into pieces, and each of them take his proportionable share: if indeed that law, de debito in partes secando, is to be understood in so very butcherly a light; which many learned men have with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> doubted. Nor do we mean those less inhuman laws (if they may be called so, as their meaning is indubitably certain), of imprisoning the debtor's person in chains; subjecting him to stripes and hard labour, at the mercy of his rigid creditor; and sometimes selling him, his wife, and children, to perpetual foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a> trans Tiberim (a): an oppression which produced so many popular insurrections, and secessions to the mons facer. But we mean the law of cession, introduced by the Christian emperors; whereby, if a debtor ceded or yielded up all his fortune to his creditors, he was secured from being dragged to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GAOL\">gaol</a>, \"omni quoque corporali cruciati fero.\" For, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> justly observes, \"inhumanum est stipulationem fortunis suis in folium damnari.\" Thus far was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> and reasonable: but as the departing from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> is apt to produce its opposite, we find it afterwards enacted, that if the debtor by any unforeseen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a> was reduced to low circumstances, and would swear that he had not sufficient left to pay his debts, he should not be compelled to cede or give up even that\n\n(a) In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEGU\">Pegu</a>, and the adjacent countries in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">East</a> Indies, the creditor is entitled to dispose of the debtor himself, and likewise of his wife and children; insomuch, that he may even violate with impunity the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHASTITY\">chastity</a> of the debtor's wife; but then, by so doing, the debt is understood to be discharged.\nBankrupt, which he had in his possession; a law which, under a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of humanity, seems to be fertile of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PERJURY\">perjury</a>, injustice, and absurdity.\n\nThe laws of England, more wisely, have steered in the middle between both extremes: providing at once against the inhumanity of the creditor, who is not suffered to confine an honest bankrupt after his effects are delivered up; and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> taking care that all his just debts shall be paid, so far as the effects will extend. But still they are cautious of encouraging prodigality and extravagance by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol12.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> to debtors: and therefore they allow the benefit of the laws of bankruptcy to none but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> traders; since that set of men are, generally speaking, the only persons liable to accidental losses, and to an inability of paying their debts, without any fault of their own. If persons in other situations of life run in debt without the power of payment, they must take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of their own indiscretion, even though they meet with sudden accidents that may reduce their fortunes: for the law holds it to be an unjustifiable practice, for any person but a trader to encumber himself with debts of any considerable value. If a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, or one in a liberal profession, at the time of contracting his debts, has a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> to pay them, the delay of payment is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of dishonesty, and a temporary injustice to his creditors: and if, at such time, he has not sufficient fund, the dishonesty and injustice is the greater. He cannot therefore murmur, if he suffers the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> which he has voluntarily drawn upon himself. But in mercantile transactions the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is far otherwise. Trade cannot be carried on without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> on both sides; the contracting of debts is therefore here not only justifiable but necessary. And if, by accidental calamities, as by the loss of a ship in a tempest, the failure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>-traders, or by the non-payment of persons out of trade, a merchant or trader becomes incapable of discharging his own debts, it is his misfortune and not his fault. To the misfortunes therefore of debtors, the law has given a compassionate remedy, but denied it to their faults: since, at the same time that it provides for the security of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, by enacting that every considerable trader may be declared a bankrupt, for the benefit of his creditors as well as himself, it has also, to discourage extravagance, declared that no one shall be capable of being made a bankrupt, but only a trader; nor capable of receiving the full benefit of the statutes, but only an industrious trader.\n\nIn the interpretation of the several statutes made concerning English bankrupts, it hath been held, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUYING\">buying</a> only, or selling only, will not qualify a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> to be a bankrupt; but it must be both buying and selling, and also getting a livelihood by it: as, by exercising the calling of a merchant, a grocer, a Mercer, or, in one general word, a Chapman, who is one that buys and sells anything. But no handicraft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a> (where nothing is bought or sold, and therefore an extensive credit, for the stock in trade, is not necessary to be had) will make a man a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> bankrupt; as that of a husbandman, a gardener, and the like, who are paid for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> and labour. Also an innkeeper cannot, as such, be a bankrupt: for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> or livelihood does not arise from buying and selling in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of merchandise, but greatly from the use of his rooms and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a>, his attendance, and the Bankrupt-like; and though he may buy corn and victuals, to sell again at a profit, yet that no more makes him a trader, than a schoolmaster or other person is, that keeps a boarding-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, and makes considerable gains by buying and selling what he spends in the house, and such a one is clearly not within the statutes. But where persons buy goods, and make them up into saleable commodities, as shoemakers, smiths, and the like; here, though part of the gain is by bodily labour, and not by buying and selling, yet they are within the statutes of bankrupts; for the labour is only in melioration of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMODITY\">commodity</a>, and rendering it more fit for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>.\n\n2. To learn what the acts of bankruptcy are which render a man a bankrupt, we must consult the several statutes, and the resolutions formed by the courts thereon. Among these may therefore be reckoned,\n\n1. Departing from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALM\">realm</a>, whereby a man withdraws himself from the jurisdiction and coercion of the law, with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENT\">intent</a> to defraud his creditors. 2. Departing from his own house, with an intent to secrete himself and avoid his creditors. 3. Keeping in his own house, privately (except for just and necessary cause), so as not to be seen or spoken with by his creditors; which is likewise construed to be an intention to defraud his creditors, by avoiding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of the law. 4. Procuring or suffering himself willingly to be arrested, or outlawed, or imprisoned, without just and lawful cause; which is likewise deemed an attempt to defraud his creditors. 5. Procuring his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, goods, chattels, and effects, to be attached or sequestrated by any legal process; which is another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> endeavour to disappoint his creditors of their security. 6. Making any fraudulent conveyance to a friend, or secret trustee, of his lands, tenements, goods, or chattels: which is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of the same culpable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> with the last. 7. Procuring any protection, not being himself privileged by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, in order to screen his person from arrests; which also is an endeavour to elude the justice of the law. 8. Endeavouring, or desiring, by any petition to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> exhibited in any of the king's courts against any creditors, to compel them to take less than their just debts; or to procrastinate the time of payment, originally contracted for; which are an acknowledgment of either his poverty or his knavery. 9. Living in prison for two months, or more, upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARREST\">arrest</a> or other detention for debt, without finding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAIL\">bail</a>, in order to obtain his liberty. For the inability to procure bail argues a strong deficiency in his credit, owing either to his suspected poverty, or ill character; and his neglect to do it, if able, can arise only from a fraudulent intention: in either of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> time for his creditors to look to themselves, and compel a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of his effects. 10. Escaping from prison after an arrest for a just debt of 100l. or upwards. For no man would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> prison, that was able and desirous to procure bail; which brings it within the reason of the last case. 11. Neglecting to make satisfaction for any just debt to the amount of 100l. within two months after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of legal process, for such debt, upon any trader having privilege of parliament.\n\nThese are the several acts of bankruptcy expressly defined by the statutes relating to this article; which being\nbeing so numerous, and the whole law of bankrupts being an innovation on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> law, our courts of justice have been tender of extending or multiplying acts of bankruptcy by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> or implication. And therefore Sir John <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLT\">Holt</a> held, that a man's removing his goods privately to prevent their being feized in execution, was no act of bankruptcy. For the statutes mention only fraudulent gifts to third persons, and procuring them to be seized by them processes, in order to defraud creditors: but this, though a palpable fraud, yet, falling within neither of those cases, cannot be adjudged an act of bankruptcy. So also it has been determined expressly, that a banker's stopping or refusing payment is no act of bankruptcy: for it is not within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of any of the statutes; and there may be good reasons for his doing so, as suspicion of forgery, and the like: and if, in consequence of such refusal, he is arrested, and puts in bail, still it is no act of bankruptcy; but if he goes to prison, and lies there two months, then, and not before, is he become a bankrupt.\n\nAs to the consequences resulting from the unhappy situation of a bankrupt, see the article Commission of Bankruptcy.","sp":425,"ep":427},{"h":"BANKS","t":"JOHN, a dramatic writer, was bred to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, and belonged to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of Gray's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INN\">Inn</a>; but this profession not suiting his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> disposition, he quitted it for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSES\">muses</a>. Here, however, he found his rewards by no means adequate to his deserts. His emoluments at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> were precarious, and the various successes of his pieces too frequently convinced him of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in his choice. This, however, did not prevent him from pursuing with cheerfulness the path he had taken; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THIRST\">thirst</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, and warmth of poetic enthusiasm, alleviating to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> many disagreeable circumstances into which indigence, the too frequent attendant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> poetical pursuits, frequently threw him. His turn was entirely to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAGEDY\">tragedy</a>; his merit in which is of a peculiar kind. For at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> must be confessed to be extremely unpoetical, and his numbers uncouth and unharmorous; nay, even his characters very far from being strongly marked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> distinguished, and his episodes extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>: yet it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to avoid being deeply affected at the representation, and even at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a>, of his tragic pieces. This is owing in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> to a happy choice of his subjects; which are all borrowed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, either real or romantic; and indeed the most of them from circumstances in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANNALS\">annals</a> of our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, which, not only from their being familiar to our continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a>, but even from their having some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of relation to ourselves, we are apt to receive with a kind of partial prepossession, and a pre-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> to be pleased.

He has indeed but little varied from the strictness of historical facts; yet he seems to have made it his constant rule to keep the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> perpetually alive, and never suffer his characters to droop. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a> is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROSE\">prose</a> run mad.

The word seems formed from banner, \"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> flag;\" or from band, which anciently denoted a flag.\u2014Bannerets are also called in ancient writers milites vexilliferi, and vexillarii bannerarii, bannarii, banderifii, &c.\n\nAnciently there were two kinds of knights, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> and little; the first whereof were called bannerets, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACHELORS\">bachelors</a>; the first composed the upper, the second the middle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>.\n\nThe banneret was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> allowed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> under his own flag, whereas the bachelarius eques followed that of another. To be qualified for a banneret, one must be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and must have a power to raise to certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of armed men, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> enough to subsist at least 28 or 30 men. This must have been very considerable in those days; because each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, besides his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a>, had two horsemen to wait <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> him armed, the one with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>-bow, the other with a bow and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HATCHET\">hatchet</a>. As he was not allowed to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARON\">baron</a> who had not above 13 knights fees, so he was not admitted to be a banneret if he had less than 10.\n\nBanneret, according to Spelman, was a middle order between a baron and a simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a>; called sometimes also vexillarius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a>, to distinguish him from the greater, that is, from the baron, to whom alone properly belonged the jus vexilli, or privilege of the square flag. Hence the banneret was also called bannercetus, quasi <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARO\">baro</a> minor; a word frequently used by English writers in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> as banneret was by the French, though neither of them occur before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of Edward II.\n\nSome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> have bannerets to have originally been persons who had some portion of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARONY\">barony</a> assigned them; and enjoyed it under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of baro proximus, and that with the same prerogatives as the baron himself. Some, again, find the origin of bannerets in France, others in Brittany, others in England. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> of bannerets to Conan, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> of Maximus, who commanded the Roman legions in England under the empire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRATIAN\">Gratian</a> in 383. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, lay they, revolting, divided England into 40 cantons, and in these cantons distributed 40 knights; to whom he gave a power of assembling, on occasion, under their several banners, as many of the effective men as were found in their respective districts: whence they are called bannerets. However this be, it appears from Froissart, &c. that anciently such of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> men as were rich enough to raise and subsist a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of armed men, and had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to do so, were called bannerets. Not, however, that these qualifications rendered them knights, but only bannerets; the appellation of knight being only added thereto, because they were simple knights before.\n\nBannerets were second to none but knights of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARTER\">garter</a>. They were reputed the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> below the nobility; and were allowed to bear arms with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SUPPORTERS\">supporters</a>, which none else may under the degree of a baron. In France, it is said, the dignity was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>; but in England it died with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> that gained\nBAN\n\nBanneret gained it. The order dwindled on the institution of baronets by King James I. and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> became extinct. The last person created banneret was Sir John Smith, made so after Edghill fight, for rescuing the standard of King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I.\n\nThe form of the banneret's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> was this. On a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of battle, the candidate presented his flag to the king or general; who, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> off the train or skirt thereof, and making it a square, returned it again, the proper banner of bannerets; who are hence sometimes called knights of the square flag. There seem to have been bannerets created either in a different manner, or by others than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a>; since King James, in the patents of baronets, gives them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRECEDENCE\">precedence</a> to all knights bannerets, except such as are created by the king himself in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>; which implies, either that there are some of this order created out of the field, or by inferior persons.\n\nBanneret is also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of an officer or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> of Rome towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the 14th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>. \u2014The people of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, and throughout the territory of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, during the disputes of the antipopes, had formed a kind of republican <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>; where the whole power was lodged in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of a magistrate called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATOR\">senator</a>, and twelve heads of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> called bannerets, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> of the banners which each raised in his district.\n\nBannock, a kind of oat-cake, baked in the embers, or on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> placed before the fire.

Others, however, insist that the Jewish proselyte baptism is not far off <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a>, and that John the Baptist was the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATOR\">administrator</a> of baptism among the Jews. Of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> were Deylingius, J. G. Carpzovius, Boernerus, Wermdorfius, Zeltnerus, Owen, Knatchbull, Jennings, Gill, and others.\n\nGrotius is of opinion, that the rite of baptism had its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> from the time of the deluge; immediately after which, he thinks, it was instituted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of the world having been purged by water. Some learned men think it was added to circumcision, soon after the Samaritan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCHISM\">schism</a>, as a mark of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORTHODOX\">orthodox</a> Jews. Spencer, who is fond of deriving the rites of the Jewish religion from the ceremonies of the Pagans, lays it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> as a probable supposition, that the Jews received the baptism of proselytes from the neighbouring nations, who were wont to prepare candidates for the more sacred functions of their religion, by a solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABLUTION\">ablution</a>; that by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> of sacred rites, they might draw the Gentiles to embrace their religion, and that the proselytes (in gaining of whom they were extremely diligent) might the more easily comply with the transition from Gentilism to Judaism. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of this opinion, he observes, first, that there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> precept for the baptism of proselytes, God having enjoined only the rite of circumcision for the admission of strangers into the Jewish religion. Secondly, that, among foreign nations, the Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, and others, it was customary that those who were to be initiated into their mysteries, or sacred rites, should be first purified by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIPPING\">dipping</a> their whole body in water. That learned writer adds, as a farther confirmation of his opinion, that the cup of blessing likewise, added to the paschal supper, seems plainly to have been derived from a pagan original: for the Greeks, at their feasts, had one cup, called \u1f00\u03c1\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5, the cup of the good demon or god, which they drank at the conclusion of their entertainment, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> was removed. Since then, a rite of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENTILE\">Gentile</a> origin was added to one of the Jewish sacraments, viz. the paschal, there can be no absurdity in supposing, that baptism, which was added to the other sacrament, namely circumcision, might be derived from the same source. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, he observes, that Christ, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> of his sacraments, paid a peculiar regard to those rites which were borrowed from the Gentiles: for rejecting circumcision and the paschal supper, he adopted into his religion baptism and the sacred cup; thus preparing the way for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSION\">conversion</a> and reception of the Gentiles into his church.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of the Jewish baptism, if baptism be practised by them, is supposed to be, to import a regeneration, whereby the proselyte is rendered a new man, and of a slave becomes free. The effect of it is, to cancel all former relations; so that those who were before akin to the person, after the ceremony ceased to be so. It is to this ceremony Christ is supposed to have alluded, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NICODEMUS\">Nicodemus</a>, that it was necessary that he should be born again, in order to become his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a>.\u2014The necessity of baptism to salvation, is grounded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> those two sayings of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVIOUR\">Saviour</a>: He that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved; and, Except a man be born of water and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">Spirit</a>, he cannot enter into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of God. The ancients did not generally think the mere want of baptism, where the profession was impracticable, excluded men absolutely from the hopes of eternal salvation. Some few of them, indeed, are pretty severe upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol11.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> dying without baptism; and some others seem also, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> terms, to deny eternal life to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADULT\">adult</a> persons dying without it; but when they interpret themselves, and speak more distinctly, they make some allowances, and except several cases, in which the want of baptism may be supplied by other means. Such are, martyrdom, which commonly goes by the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> baptism in men's own blood, in the writings of the ancients; because of the power and efficacy it was thought to have to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> men by the invisible baptism of the Spirit, without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> element of water. Faith, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPENTANCE\">repentance</a>, were also esteemed a supplement to the want of baptism, in such catechumens as died while they were piously preparing themselves for baptism. Constantly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a>\nBaptism. communicating with the church, was thought to supply the want of baptism, in persons who had been admitted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a>, on a presumption of their being duly baptized, though the contrary afterwards appeared. For infants dying without baptism, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> was thought more dangerous; as here, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> faith, repentance, or the like, could be pleaded, to supply the defect, and wash away original sin: on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>, they who spoke most favourably of them, as Greg. Nazianzen, and Severus bishop of Antioch, only assigned them a middle state, neither in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HELL\">hell</a>. But the Latins, as St. Augustin, Fulgentius, Marius Mercator, &c., who never received the opinion of a middle state, concluded, as they could not be received into heaven, they must go to hell. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PELAGIUS\">Pelagius</a>, and his followers, who denied original sin, affirmed, that they might be admitted to eternal life and salvation, though not to the kingdom of heaven; between which they distinguished. Where the fault was not on the side of the child, nor his parents, but of the minister, or where any unavoidable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a> rendered baptism absolutely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, Hincmar, and others, make an exception, in holding the child saved without baptism.\n\nThe receiving baptism is not limited to any time, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of life. Some contend for its being administered like circumcision, precisely on the eighth day, as Greg. Nazianzen; and others would have it deferred till the child is three years of age, and able to hear the mystic words, and make answer thereto, though he do not understand them. In the canon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> we find divers injunctions against deferring the baptism of infants beyond the 37th day, 30th day, and the 9th day; some of them under pecuniary forfeitures.\n\nSalmans, and Suicerus from him, deliver it as authentic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, that for the two first ages, no one received baptism, who was not first instructed in the faith and doctrine of Christ, so as to be able to answer for himself, that he believed; because of those words, He that believeth, and is baptized; which, in effect, is to say, that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a>, for the first two ages, was ever admitted to Christian baptism. But, afterwards, they own, that pedo-baptism came in, upon the opinion that baptism was necessary to salvation. But Vossius, Dr Forbes, Dr Hammond, Mr Walker, and especially Mr Wall, who has exactly considered the testimony and authority of almost every ancient writer that has said anything upon this subject, endeavour to evince, that infants were baptized even in the apostolical age. It is certain, Tertullian pleads strongly against giving baptism to infants; which shows, at least, that there was some such practice in his age, though he disapproved of it. It is certain, the ordinary subjects of this sacrament, in the first ages, were converts from Judaism and Gentilism, who, before they could be admitted to baptism, were obliged to spend some time in the state of catechumens, to qualify them to make their professions of faith, and a Christian life, in their own persons: for, without such personal professions, there was ordinarily no admission of them to the privilege of baptism. Those baptized in their sick-beds were called clinic; and were held in some reproof, as not being reputed true Christians. Hence several canons, in councils and ecclesiastical writers, of clinic baptism. This clinic baptism was not sufficient to qualify the person, in case of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a>, for ordination. Some had their baptism put off by way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, when they fell into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> and scandalous crimes, which were to be expiated by a longer course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> and repentance. This was sometimes 5, 10, 20 years, or more; even all their lives to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, when their crimes were very flagrant.\n\nIn the earliest ages of the church, there was no stated time or place for the reception of baptism. Afterwards Edifier, Whitfuntide, and Epiphany, became solemn seasons, out of which baptism was not administered, except in cases of necessity. The catechumens who were to receive it at these times, were called competences; and to these it is that St Cyril addresses his catecheses. In the apostolical age, and some time after, before churches and baptisteries were generally erected, they baptized in any place where they had convenience; as John baptized in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JORDAN\">Jordan</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> baptized the eunuch in the wilderness, and Paul the jailor in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>. But in after ages, baptisteries were built adjoining to the church; and then rules were made, that baptism should ordinarily be administered nowhere but in these buildings. Julian, in one of his novels, refers to ancient laws, appointing that none of the sacred mysteries of the church should be celebrated in private houses. Men might have private oratories for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a> in their own houses; but they were not to administer baptism or the eucharist in them, unless by a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LICENSE\">license</a> from the bishop of the place. Such baptisms are frequently condemned in the ancient councils, under the name \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd, baptisms in private conventicles.\n\nAs to the attendant ceremonies and manner of baptism in the ancient church: The person to be baptized, if an adult, was first examined by the bishop or officiating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>, who put some questions to him; as, first, Whether he abjured the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a> and all his works; secondly, Whether he gave a firm assent to all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of the Christian faith; to both which he answered in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFIRMATIVE\">affirmative</a>. If the person to be baptized was an infant, these interrogatories were answered by his sponsors, or godfathers. Whether the use of sponsors was old as the apostles' days, is uncertain; perhaps it was not, since <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-JUSTIN_MARTYR\">Justin <a cla</a>ss=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARTYR\">Martyr</a>, speaking of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> and form of baptism, says not a word of them.\u2014After the questions and answers, followed exorcism; the manner and end of which was this: The minister laid his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> on the person's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, and breathed in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, implying thereby the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DRIVING\">driving</a> away or expelling of the devil from him, and preparing him for baptism, by which the good and holy spirit was to be conferred upon him.\u2014After exorcism, followed baptism itself: and first the minister, by prayer, consecrated the water for that use. Tertullian says, \"any waters may be applied to that use: but then God must be first invoked; and then the Holy Ghost presently comes down from heaven, and moves upon them, and sanctifies them.\" The waters being consecrated, the person was baptized \"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;\" by which, \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEDICATION\">dedication</a> of him to the blest Trinity, the person (says Clemens Alexandrinus) is delivered from the corrupt trinity, the devil, the world, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>.\" In performing the ceremony of baptism, the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> (except in clinical cases,\nBaptism. or where there was scarcity of water), was to immerse and dip the whole body. Thus St Barnabas, describing a baptized person, says, \"We go down into the water full of sin and filth, but we ascend <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> fruit in our hearts.\" And this practice of immersing the whole body was so general, that we find no exceptions made in respect either to the tenderness of infants, or the frailty of the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, unless in case of sickness or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISABILITY\">disability</a>. But to prevent any indecency, men and women were baptized apart. To which end, either the baptisteries were divided into two apartments, one for the men, the other for the women, as Bingham has observed; or the men were baptized at one time and the women at another, as is shown by Volhus, from the Ordo Romanus, Gregory's Sacramentarium, &c. Add, that there was anciently an order of deaconesses, one part of whose business was to assist at the baptism of women. The precautions, however, rather indicate a scrupulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to delicacy, than imply any indecency in the circumstance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMERSION\">immersion</a> itself. From the candidates being immersed, there is at least no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to infer that they were naked: The present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAPTISTS\">Baptists</a> never baptize naked, though they always immerse. After immersion, followed the unction; by which (says St Cyril) was signified that they were now cut off from the wild olive, and were ingrafted into Christ, the true olive tree; or else to show that they were now to be champions for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOSPEL\">gospel</a>, and were anointed thereto, as the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-ATHLETE\">athlete</a> were against their solemn games. With this anointing was joined the sign of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>, made upon the forehead of the person baptized; which being done, he had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> garment given him, to denote his being washed from the defilements of sin, or in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLUSION\">allusion</a> to that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol3.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a>, \"As many as are baptized in Christ have put on Christ.\" From this custom the feast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENTECOST\">Pentecost</a>, which was one of the annual feasts of baptism, came to be called Whitewashday, i.e. White-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUNDAY\">sunday</a>. This garment was afterwards laid up in the church, that it might be an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> against such persons as violated or denied that faith which they had owned in baptism.\u2014When the baptism was performed, the person baptized, according to Justin Martyr, \"was received into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the faithful, who then sent up their public prayers to God, for all men, for themselves, and for those who had been baptized.\"\n\nThe ordinary ministers, who had the right of administering this sacrament, that is, of applying the water to the body, and pronouncing the formula, were presbyters or bishops; though on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> occasions laymen were admitted to perform the same.\n\nAs to the present form of administering baptism, that is, of applying the water to the body, and pronouncing the formula, were presbyters or bishops; though on extraordinary occasions laymen were admitted to perform the same.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">Modern</a> forms in the church of Rome uses the following. When a child is to be baptized, the persons who bring it wait for the priest at the door of the church, who comes thither in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SURPLICE\">surplice</a> and purple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOLE\">stole</a>, attended by his clerks. He begins with questioning the godfathers, whether they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a>, in the child's name, to live and die in the true catholic and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOSTOLIC\">apostolic</a> faith, and what name they would give the child. Then follows an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXHORTATION\">exhortation</a> to the sponsors; after which the priest, calling the child by its name, asks it as follows: What dost thou demand of the church? The godfather answers, Eternal life. The priest goes on: If you are desirous of obtaining eternal life, keep God's commandments, thou shalt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> the Lord thy God, &c. After which he breathes three times in the child's face, saying, Come out of this child, thou evil spirit, and make room for the Holy Ghost. This said, he makes the sign of the cross on the child's forehead and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, saying, Receive the sign of the cross on thy forehead, and in thy heart. Then taking off his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>, he repeats a short prayer; and laying his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> gently on the child's head, repeats a second prayer; which ended, he blesses some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>; and putting a little of it into the child's mouth, pronounces these words, Receive the salt of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>. All this is performed at the church-door. The priest, with the godfathers and godmothers, coming into the church, and advancing towards the font, repeat the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol3.html#article-APOSTLES_CREED\">apostles' creed</a> and the Lord's prayer. Being come to the font, the priest exorcises the evil spirit again; and taking a little of his own spittle, with the thumb of his right-hand, rubs it on the child's ears and nostrils, repeating, as he touches the right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>, the same word (Epiphania, be thou opened) which our Saviour made use of to the man born <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAF_AND_DUMB\">deaf and dumb</a>. Lastly, they pull off its swaddling-clothes, or strip it below the shoulders, during which the priest prepares the oils, &c. The sponsors then hold the child directly over the font, observing to turn it due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> and west: whereupon the priest asks the child, Whether he renounces the devil and all his works? and the godfather having answered in the affirmative, the priest anoints the child between the shoulders in the form of a cross. Then taking some of the consecrated water, he pours part of it thrice on the child's head, at each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERORATION\">peroration</a> calling on one of the Persons of the Holy Trinity. The priest concludes the ceremony of baptism with an exhortation.\u2014The Romish church allows midwives, in cases of danger, to baptize a child before it comes entirely out of its mother's womb; where it is to be observed, that some part of the body of the child must appear before it can be baptized, and that it is baptized on the part which first appears: if the head, it is not necessary to rebaptize the child; but if only a foot or hand appears, it is necessary to repeat baptism. A stillborn child thus baptized may be buried in consecrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>.\n\nThe Greek church differs from the Romish, as to the rite of baptism, chiefly in performing it by immersion, or plunging the infant all over in the water.\n\nThe forms of administering baptism among us being English too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> known to require a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, we shall only mention one or two of the more material differences between the form, as it stood in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LITURGY\">liturgy</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">King</a> Edward, and that in the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">Common</a> Prayer Book at present. First, the form of consecrating the water did not make a part of the office, in King Edward's liturgy, as it does in the present, because the water in the font was changed, and consecrated, but once a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>. The form likewise itself was something different from that now used; and was introduced with a short prayer, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ, upon whom (when he was baptized) the Holy Ghost came down in the likeness of a dove, would send down the same Holy Spirit, to sanctify the fountain of baptism; which prayer was afterwards left out, at the second revision.\u2014By King Edward's first book, the minister is to dip the child in the water thrice; first, dipping the right-side; secondly, the left; the third time, dipping the face toward the foot. This trine immersion was a very ancient.\nclient practice in the Christian church, and used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the Holy Trinity; though some later writers say, it was done to represent the death, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BURIAL\">burial</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESURRECTION\">resurrection</a> of Christ, together with his three days continuance in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>. Afterwards, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARIANS\">Arians</a> making an ill use of it, by persuading the people that it was used to denote that the three Persons in the Trinity were three distinct substances, the orthodox left it off, and used only one single immersion.\n\nBy the first common-prayer of King Edward, after the child was baptized, the godfathers and godmothers were to lay their hands upon it, and the minister was to put on him the white vestment commonly called the chrysosome, and to say, \"Take this white vesture, as a token of the innocency, which, by God's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a>, in this holy sacrament of baptism, is given unto thee; and for a sign, whereby thou art admonished, so long as thou livest, to give thyself to innocence of living, that after this transitory life thou mayest be partaker of the life everlasting. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMEN\">Amen</a>.\" As soon as he had pronounced these words, he was to anoint the infant on the head, saying, \"Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath regenerated thee by water and the Holy Ghost, and hath given unto thee <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMISSION\">remission</a> of all thy sins; may he vouchsafe to anoint thee with the unction of his Holy Spirit, and bring thee to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INHERITANCE\">inheritance</a> of everlasting life. Amen.\" This was manifestly done in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the practice of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> church.\n\nThe custom of sprinkling children, instead of dipping them in the font, which at first was allowed in case of the weakness or sickness of the infant, has so far prevailed, that immersion is at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> quite excluded. What principally tended to confirm the practice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFUSION\">affusion</a> or sprinkling, was, that several of our Protestant divines, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> into Germany and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a> during the bloody reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, and returning home when Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> came to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, brought back with them a great zeal for the Protestant churches beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, where they had been sheltered and received; and having observed, that at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENEVA\">Geneva</a> and some other places, baptism was administered by sprinkling, they thought they could not do the church of England a greater piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> than by introducing a practice dictated by so great an oracle as Calvin. This, together with the coldness of our northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, was what contributed to banish entirely the practice of dipping infants in the font.\n\nMany different notions have been entertained concerning the effects of baptism, which it would be useless to enumerate.\u2014The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMONSTRANTS\">Remonstrants</a> and Socinians reduce baptism to a mere sign of divine grace. The Romanists, on the contrary, exalt its power; holding, that all sin is entirely taken away by it; that it absolutely confers the grace of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUSTIFICATION\">justification</a>, and consequently grace ex opero operato. Some also speak of an indelible character impressed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> by it, called character dominicus, and character regius; but this is held, by others, a mere chimera; for that the spiritual character, conferred in regeneration, may easily be effaced by mortal sins. Dodwell maintained, that it is by baptism the soul is made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a>; so that those who die without it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not rise again. It must be added, he restrains this effect to episcopal baptism alone. From the effects ordinarily ascribed to baptism, even by ancient writers, it should seem, that the ceremony is as much of heathen as Jewish origin; since Christians do not restrain the use of it, like the Jews, to the admission of new members into the church, but hold, with the heathens, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> in it for remitting and washing away sins. The Brahmans are still said to baptize with this latter view, at certain seasons, in the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-GANGES\">Ganges</a>; to the waters whereof they have annexed a cleansing or sanctifying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>; and hence it is that they flock from all parts, even of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a>, driven by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of their being eased of their load of sins. But, in this point, many Christians seem to have gone beyond the folly of the heathens. It was only the smaller sins of infirmity which these latter held to be expiable by washing; for crimes of a blacker dye, they allowed no water could efface them, nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PURGATION\">purgation</a> could discharge them. The Christian doctrine of a total remission of sins by baptism could not fail, therefore, to scandalize many among the heathens, and furnished Julian an occasion of satirizing Christianity itself: \"Whoever (says he) is guilty of rapes, murders, sacrilege, or any abominable crime, let him be washed with water, and he will become pure and holy.\"\n\nIn the ancient church, baptism was frequently conferred on Jews by violence: but the church itself never seems to have allowed of force on this occasion. By a canon of the fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOLEDO\">Toledo</a>, it is expressly forbidden to baptize any against their wills. That which looks most like force in this case, allowed by law, were two orders of Justinian; one of which appoints the heathens, and the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SAMARITANS\">Samaritans</a>, to be baptized, with their wives and children and servants, under pain of confiscation. By the ancient laws, baptism was not to be conferred on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a>-makers, stage-players, gladiators, aurige or public drivers, magicians, or even strolling beggars, till they quitted such professions. Slaves were not allowed the privilege of baptism without the testimony and consent of their masters; excepting the slaves of Jews, Heathens, and heretics; who were not only admitted to baptism, but, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> thereof, had their freedom. Voissus, c. 11, \u00a7 17, has a learned and elaborate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> De Baptismo, wherein he accurately discusses all the questions concerning baptism according to the doctrine of the ancients.\n\nBaptism by Fire, spoken of by St John the Baptist, has occasioned much conjecture. The generality of the fathers held, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol3.html#article-BELIEVERS\">believers</a>, before they enter paradise, are to pass through a certain fire, which is to purify them from all pollutions remaining on them unexpiated. Others, with St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol3.html#article-BASIL\">Basil</a>, understand it of the fire of hell; others, of that of tribulation and temptation. Others, with St Chrysostom, will have it denote an abundance of graces. Others suppose it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of the Holy Ghost on the apostles, in form of fiery tongues. Lastly, others maintain, that the word fire here is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERPOLATION\">interpolation</a>; and that we are only to read the text, He that shall come after me will baptise you with the Holy Ghost. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>, it is not found in divers manuscript copies of St Matthew.\n\nThe ancient Selucians and Hermians, understanding the passage literally, maintained, that material fire was necessary in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a> of baptism. But we do not find how or to what part of the body they applied it, or whether they were satisfied with obliging\nBaptism the person baptized to pass through the fire. Valentius rebaptized all who had received water-baptism, and conferred on them the baptism of fire.\n\nBis docuit tincti, traductoque corpore flamma.\nTERTULL. Carm. contr. Marc. l. 1.\n\nHeraclon, cited by Clemens Alexandrinus, says, that some applied a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>-hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> to the ears of the person baptized, as if to impress some mark upon him.\n\nBaptism of the Dead, a custom which anciently prevailed among some people in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, of giving baptism to the dead. The third council of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a> speaks of it as a thing that ignorant Christians were fond of. Gregory Nazianzen also takes notice of the same superstitious opinion prevailing among some who delayed to be baptized. In his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> to this kind of men, he asks, whether they stayed to be baptized after death? Philadrius also notes it as the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTANISTS\">Montanists</a> or Cataphrygians, that they baptized men after death. The practice seems to be grounded on a vain opinion, that, when men had neglected to receive baptism in their life-time, some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPENSATION\">compensation</a> might be made for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFAULT\">default</a> by receiving it after death.\n\nBaptism of the Dead was also a sort of vicarious baptism, formerly in use, when a person dying without baptism, another was baptized in his stead.\n\nSt Chrysostom tells us, this was practiced among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARCIONITES\">Marcionites</a> with a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of ridiculous ceremony; which he thus describes: After any catechumen was dead, they hid a living man under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of the deceased; then coming to the dead man, they asked him, whether he would receive baptism; and he making no answer, the other answered for him, and said, he would be baptized in his stead; and so they baptized the living for the dead.\n\nEpiphanius affirms us, the like was also practiced among the Corinthians. This practice they pretended to found on the Apostle's authority; alleging that text of St Paul for it, If the dead rise not at all, what shall they do who are baptized for the dead? A text which has given occasion to a great variety of different systems and explanations. Vossius enumerates no less than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> different opinions among learned divines concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a>, being baptized for the dead.\n\nSt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBROSE\">Ambrose</a> and Walfrid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRABO\">Strabo</a> seem clearly of opinion, that the apostle had respect to such a custom then in being; and several moderns have given into the same opinion, as Baronius, Jof. Scaliger, Justellus, and Grotius.\n\nSeveral among the Roman Catholics, as Bellarmin, Salmeron, Menochius, and a number of schoolmen, understand it of the baptism of tears, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENANCE\">penance</a>, and prayers, which the living undergo for the dead; and thus allege it as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PURGATORY\">purgatory</a> in St Paul's days.\n\nHypothetical Baptism, that formerly administered in certain doubtful cases, with this formula: If thou art baptized, I do not rebaptize; if thou art not, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, &c. This sort of baptism, enjoined by some ancient constitutions of the English church, is now fallen into disuse.\n\nSolemn Baptism, that conferred at stated seasons; such, in the ancient church, were the Paschal baptism, and that at Whitetide. This is sometimes also called Lay Baptism.\n\nLay Baptism, we find to have been permitted by both the Common-prayer Books of King Edward and that of Queen Elizabeth, when an infant is in immediate danger of death, and a lawful minister cannot be had. This was founded upon the mistaken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of the impossibility of salvation without the sacrament of baptism; but afterwards, when they came to have clearer notions of the sacraments, it was unanimously resolved in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVOCATION\">convocation</a>, held in the year 1575, that even private baptism, in a case of necessity, was only to be administered by a lawful minister.\n\nBaptism is also applied, abusively, to certain ceremonies used in giving names to things <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INANIMATE\">inanimate</a>.\n\nThe ancients knew nothing of the custom of giving baptism to inanimate things, as bells, ships, and the like, by a superstitious consecration of them. The first notice we have of this is in the Capitulars of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> the Great, where it is only mentioned to be censured; but, afterwards, it crept into the Roman offices by degrees. Baronius carries its antiquity no higher than the year 968, when the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELL\">bell</a> of the church of Lateran was christened by Pope John III. At last it grew to that superstitious height, as to be thought proper to be complained of in the Centum Gravamina of the German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, drawn up in the public diet of the empire held at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUREMBERG\">Nuremberg</a> anno 1581; where (after having described the ceremony of baptizing a bell, with godfathers, who make responses as in baptism, and give it a name, and clothe it with a new garment as Christians were used to be clothed, and all this to make it capable of driving away tempests and devils) they conclude against it, as not only a superstitious practice, but contrary to the Christian religion, and a mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SEDUCTION\">seduction</a> of the simple people.\n\nBaptism, in the sea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, a ceremony in long voyages on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> merchant ships, practiced both on persons and vessels who pass the tropic or line for the first time. The baptizing the vessels is simple, and consists only in washing them throughout with sea-water; that of the passengers is more mysterious. The oldest of the crew, that has past the tropic or line, comes with his face blacked, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GROTESQUE\">grotesque</a> cap on his head, and some sea-book in his hand, followed by the rest of the seamen dressed like himself, each having some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a> utensil in his hand, with drums <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a>; he places himself on a seat on the deck, at the foot of the mainmast. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a> of this mock <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>, each passenger not yet initiated, swears he will take care the same ceremony be observed, whenever he is in the like circumstances: Then, by giving a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> by way of gratification, he is discharged with a little sprinkling of water; otherwise he is heartily drenched with streams of water poured upon him; and the ship boys are enclosed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAGE\">cage</a>, and ducked at discretion.\u2014The seamen, on the baptizing a ship, pretend to a right of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> off the beak-head unless redeemed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>.\n\nBaptismal, something belonging to baptism; thus we say baptismal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOW\">vow</a>, presents, &c.\n\nBaptismal Vow or Covenant, a profession of obedience to the laws of Christ, which persons in the ancient church made before baptism. It was an indispensible\nBaptismal penitent part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLIGATION\">obligation</a> on catechumens, before they were admitted to the ceremony of regeneration.\n\nIt was made by turning to the east; for what mystical reasons, is not well agreed on.\n\nBAPTISMAL Prefects are in use in Germany, made by the sponsors to the infant, consisting of money, plate, or even sometimes fees of lands; which by the laws of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> are to be kept for the child till of age, the parents having only the trust, not the right, of disposing of them. An anonymous author has published a discourse express on this occasion, entitled, De pecunia lufrica.","sp":430,"ep":435},{"h":"BAPTIST","t":"John Monnoyer, a painter of flowers and fruit, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LILLE\">Lille</a> in 1635, and educated at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTWERP\">Antwerp</a>, where he perfected himself in the knowledge of his art, and in his first years was intended for a painter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>: but having soon observed that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> more strongly inclined him to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> of flowers, he applied his talents to those subjects, and in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> became one of the greatest masters. His pictures are not so exquisitely finished as those of Van Huysum, but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> and colouring are in a bolder style.

Thus it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till the fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, when the baptisteries began to be taken into the church-porch, and afterwards into the church itself.\n\nThe ancient baptisteries were commonly called *fontes*, *photiferia*, q.d., places of illumination; an appellation sometimes given to baptism. Or they might have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> for another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, because they were the places of an illumination, or instruction, preceding baptism: for here the catechumens seem to have been trained up, and instructed in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of the Christian faith.\n\nThose baptisteries were anciently very capacious; because, as Dr Cave observes, the stated times of baptism returning but seldom, there were usually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> multitudes to be baptized at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>: and then the manner of baptizing, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMERSION\">immersion</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIPPING\">dipping</a> under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, made it necessary to have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> font likewise. In Venantius Fortunatus, it is called *aula baptifinatis*, the large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> of baptism; which was indeed so capacious, that we sometimes read of councils meeting and sitting therein. This hall, or chapel, was always kept shut during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENT\">Lent</a>, and the door sealed up with the bishop's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>, not to be opened till Maunday-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THURSDAY\">Thursday</a>.\n\nThe baptistery was always reputed a sacred place. In the Roman order, we find the ceremonies used in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSECRATION\">consecration</a> of the baptisteries: they were to be built of a round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, and distinguished with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a> of St John the Baptist; over the basin or font was a figure of a dove in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> or silver, to represent the Holy Ghost.\n\nThe name baptistery is sometimes also given to a kind of chapel in a large church, which served for the same office. It is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of some learned men, that anciently there was but one baptistery in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, and that at the bishop's church; and that afterwards they were set up in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> churches, with the special allowance however of the bishop.","sp":436,"ep":436},{"h":"BAPTISTS","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">Ecclesiastical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>, (from \u03b2\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03c9, baptize); a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, distinguished from other Christians by their particular opinions respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> and the subjects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a>.\n\nInstead of administering the ordinance by sprinkling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> pouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, they maintain that it ought to be administered only by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMERSION\">immersion</a>. Such, they insist, is the meaning of the word \u03b2\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03c9; so that a command to baptize is a command to immerse. Thus it was understood by those who first administered it. John the Baptist, and the apostles of Christ, administered it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JORDAN\">Jordan</a> and other rivers and places where there was much water. Both the administrators and the subjects are described as going <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> into, and coming up again out of, the water; and the baptized are said to be buried in baptism, and to be raised again: which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> could not, they say, be properly adopted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> supposition of the ordinance being administered in any other manner than by immersion. Thus also, they affirm, it was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> administered in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>. Thus it is now administered in the Russian and Greek church: and thus it is, at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, directed to be administered in the church of England, to all who are thought capable of submitting to it in this manner. With regard to the subjects of baptism, the Baptists say, that this ordinance ought not to be administered to children or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol11.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> at all, nor to grown up persons in general; but to adults only of a certain character and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. Our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVIOUR\">Saviour</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> to his apostles, by which Christian baptism was instituted, is to go and teach all nations, baptizing them; that is, say they, not to baptize all they meet with; but first to instruct them\u2014to teach all nations, or to preach the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOSPEL\">gospel</a> to every creature\u2014and whoever receives it, him to baptize in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. To such persons, and to such only, baptism appears to have been administered by the apostles, and the immediate disciples of Christ. They are described as repenting of their sins, as believing in Christ, and as having gladly received the word. Without these qualifications, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> acquaints those who were converted by his sermon, that he could not have admitted them to baptism, Philips holds the same language in his discourse with the eunuch; and Paul treats Lydia, the jailor, and others, in the same manner. Without these qualifications, Christians in general think it wrong to admit persons to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>; and, for the same reasons, without these qualifications, at least a profession of them, the Baptists think it wrong to admit any to baptism. Therefore they withhold it, not only from the impenitently vicious and profane, and from infidels who have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>; but also from infants and children, who have no knowledge, and are incapable of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a>. They further insist, that all positive institutions depend entirely upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> and declaration of the institutor; and therefore, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> from abrogated Jewish rites is to be rejected, and the express commands of Christ respecting the mode and subjects of baptism ought to be our only rule.\n\nThe Baptists in England form one of the denominations of Protestant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISSENTERS\">Dissenters</a>. They separate from the establishment for the same reasons as their brethren of the other denominations do; and from additional motives derived from their particular tenets respecting baptism. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of their churches, and their modes of worship, are congregational or independent; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of which they are protected, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> with other dissenters, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOLERATION\">toleration</a>. Before this act, they were liable to pains and penalties as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NONCONFORMISTS\">nonconformists</a>, and often for their peculiar sentiments as Baptists. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a> was issued out against them, and some of them were burnt in Smithfield in 1558. They bore a considerable share in the persecutions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> and of the preceding centuries; and, as it should seem, in those of some centuries before; for there were several among the Lollards and the followers of Wickliff, who disapproved of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a>-baptism. There were many of this persuasion among the Protestants and reformers abroad. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, Germany, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a>, they went by the names of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ANABAPTISTS\">Anabaptists</a>, and Mennonites; and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIEDMONT\">Piedmont</a> and the South, they were found among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBIGENSES\">Albigenses</a> and Waldenses. See the histories of the Reformation, and the above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DICTIONARY\">Dictionary</a>.\n\nThe Baptists subsist under two denominations, viz. the Particular or Calvinistical, and the General or Arminian. The former is by far the most numerous. Some of both denominations allow of mixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a>, viz. of persons who have been sprinkled in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a>, and therefore unbaptized in the view of the Baptists; others disallow it; and some of them observe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a> day of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> as the Sabbath, apprehending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> that enjoined it not to have been repealed by Christ or his apostles.

This surprising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> was the son of Francis Baratiere, minister of the French church at Schwoebach near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUREMBERG\">Nuremberg</a>, where he was born Jan. 10th 1721. The French was his mother tongue, together with some words of High Dutch; but by means of his father insensibly talking Latin to him, it became as familiar to him as the rest; so that, without knowing the rules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a>, he at four years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> talked French to his mother.\nBaratiere, mother, Latin to his father, High Dutch to the maid or neighbouring children; and all this without mixing or confounding the respective languages. About the middle of his fifth year he acquired Greek in like manner; so that in 15 months he perfectly understood all the Greek books in the Old and New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, which he readily translated into Latin. When he was five years and eight months old, he entered upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a>; and in three years <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> was so expert in the Hebrew text, that from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIBLE\">bible</a> without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, he could give the sense of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> in Latin or French; or translate extempore the Latin or French versions into Hebrew, almost word for word; and had all the Hebrew psalms by heart. He composed at this time a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DICTIONARY\">dictionary</a> of rare and difficult Hebrew words, with critical remarks and philological observations, in about 400 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a> in 4to; and, about his tenth year, amused himself for twelve months with the Rabbinical writers. With these he intermixed a knowledge of the Chaldaic, Syriac, and Arabic; and acquired a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> antiquity, by studying the Greek fathers, and councils of the first four ages of the church. In the midst of these occupations, a pair of globes coming into his possession, he could in 8 or 10 days time resolve all the problems on them; and in about three months, in Jan. 1735, devised his project for the discovery of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>, which he communicated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> and the Royal Academy of Sciences at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1731, he was matriculated in the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALTDORF\">Altdorf</a>; and at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the year 1732, he was presented by his father at the meeting of the reformed churches of the circle of Franconia; who, astonished at his wonderful talents, admitted him to assist in the deliberations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYNOD\">synod</a>; and to preserve the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of so singular an event, it was ordered to be registered in their acts.\n\nIn 1734, the margrave of Brandenburgh Anspach granted this young scholar the use of whatever books he wanted from the Anspach library, together with a pension of 50 florins, which he enjoyed three years; and his father receiving a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> to the French church at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STETTIN\">Stettin</a> in Pomerania, young Baratiere was, on the journey, admitted master of arts, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a>, at the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a>; at Berlin he was honoured with several conversations with the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a>, and was received into the Royal Academy. Towards the close of his life he acquired a taste for medals, inscriptions, and antiquities; metaphysical inquiries, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXPERIMENTAL_PHILOSOPHY\">experimental <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, intervening occasionally between these studies. He wrote several essays and dissertations; made astronomical remarks, and laborious calculations; took great pains toward a history of the heresies of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTI\">anti</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRINITARIANS\">trinitarians</a>, and of the 30 years <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> in Germany; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> publication, which appeared in 1740, was on the succession of the bishops of Rome.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> is hot, but not unwholesome, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> being qualified by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-breezes; and a temperate regimen renders this island as safe to live in as any climate south of Great Britain; and, according to the opinion of many, as even Great Britain itself. This island has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> its east side two streams that are called rivers, and in the middle is said to have a bituminous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> which sends forth a liquor like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TAR\">tar</a>, and serves for the same uses as pitch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>. The island abounds in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELLS\">wells</a> of good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and has several reservoirs for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>-water. Some parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> are said to be hollowed into caves, some of them capable of containing 300 people. These are imagined to have been the lurking-places of runaway <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol7.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a>, but may as probably be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> excavations. The woods that formerly grew upon the island have been all cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> converted into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> plantations. When those plantations were first formed, the soil was prodigiously fertile, but has since been worn out, inasmuch, that about the year 1732, the planters were obliged to raise cattle for the sake of their dung, by which means the profit of their plantations was reduced to less than a tenth of its usual value. Notwithstanding the smallness of Barbadoes, its soil is different;\nBarbadoes, different; being in some places <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, and others rich, and in others spongey; but all of it is cultivated according to its proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, so that the island presents to the eye the most beautiful appearance that can be imagined. Oranges and lemons grow in Barbadoes in great plenty, and in their utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>. The lemon juice here has a peculiar fragrancy. The citrons of Barbadoes afford the best drams and sweetmeats of any in the world, the Barbadoes ladies excelling in the art of preserving the rind of the citron fruit. The juice of the limes, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DWARF\">dwarf</a> lemons, is the most agreeable souring we know, and great quantities of it have of late been imported into Britain and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>. The pine apple is also a native of Barbadoes, and grows there to much greater perfection than it can be made to do in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> means. A vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of different trees peculiar to the climate are also found to flourish in Barbadoes in great perfection; such as the aloe, mangrove, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALABASH\">calabash</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CEDAR\">cedar</a>, cotton, mastic, &c. Here likewise are produced some sensitive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, with a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of garden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STUFF\">stuff</a>, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in other places. In short, a native of the finest, the richest, and most diversified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> in Europe, can hardly form an idea of the variety of delicious and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> nutritive vegetable productions with which this island abounds.\n\nWhen Barbadoes was first discovered by the English, few or no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a> were found upon it, except hogs, which had been left there by the Portuguese. For convenience of carriage to the sea side, some of the planters at first procured camels; which undoubtedly would in all respects have been preferable to horses for their fugar and other works; but the nature of the climate disagreeing with that animal, it was found <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to preserve the breed. They then applied for horses to Old and New England: from the former they had those that were fit for thow and draught; from the latter those that were proper for mounting their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a>, and for the saddle. They had likewise some of an inferior breed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CURACAO\">Curacao</a>, and other settlements. They are reported to have had their first breed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> cattle from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BONAVISTA\">Bonavista</a> and the isle of Mayo; they now breed upon the island, and often do the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of horses. Their asses are very serviceable in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> burdens to and from the plantations. The hogs of Barbadoes are finer eating than those of Britain, but the few sheep they have are not near so good. They likewise have goats, which when young are excellent food. Racoons and monkeys are also found here in great abundance. A variety of birds are produced on Barbadoes, of which the humming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> is the most remarkable. Wild fowl do not often frequent this island; but sometimes teal are found near their ponds. A bird which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, is said to meet ships at 20 leagues from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, and their return is, to the inhabitants, a sure sign of the arrival of these ships. When the wind blows from the south and south-west, they have flocks of curlews, plovers, snipes, wild pigeons, and wild ducks. The wild pigeons are very fat and plentiful at such seasons, and rather larger than those of England. The tame pigeons, pullets, ducks, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a> of all kinds, that are bred at Barbadoes, have also a fine flavour, and are accounted more delicious than those of Europe. Their rabbits are scarce; they have no hares; and if they have deer of any kind, they are kept as curiosities, Barbadoes.\n\nThe insects of Barbadoes are not venomous, nor do either their snakes or scorpions ever sting. The muskettos are troublesome, and bite, but are more tolerable in Barbadoes than on the continent. Various other insects are found on the island, some of which are troublesome, but in no greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> than those that are produced by every warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> in England. Barbadoes is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> supplied with fish; and some caught in the sea surrounding it are almost peculiar to itself; such as the parrot-fish, snappers, grey cavallos, terbums, and coney-fish. The mullets, lobsters, and crabs, caught here are excellent; and the green turtle is perhaps the greatest delicacy that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> can boast of. At Barbadoes this delicious shell-fish seldom sells for less than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>, and often for more. There is found in this island a kind of land crab which eats herbs wherever it can find them, and shelters itself in holes and hollows of trees. According to report, they are a shell-fish of passage; for in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> they travel to the sea in great numbers.\n\nSee Cancer.\n\nThe inhabitants may be reduced to three classes; viz. the masters, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> servants, and the blacks. The former are either English, Scots, or Irish: but the great encouragement given by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> to the peopling of this and other West <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> islands, induced some Dutch, French, Portuguese, and Jews, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> among them with their estates; by which, after a certain time, they acquire the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of naturalization in Great Britain. The white servants, whether by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVENANT\">covenant</a> or purchase, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> more easy lives than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>-labourers in England; and when they come to be overseers, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> and other allowances are considerable. As to the treatment of the negro slaves in this and the other islands, that falls to be spoken of under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> Negro, Slave, West Indies; which see. The manners of the white inhabitants, in general, are the same as in most polite towns and counties in Europe. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of the island is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRIDGE\">Bridge</a>-Town; see that article.\n\nAs the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of this island furnishes no very remarkable events, the following short hints concerning it may suffice.\n\nWhen the English, some time after the year 1625, first landed here, they found it the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> and desolate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> they had hitherto visited. It had not the least appearance of ever having been peopled even by savages. There was no kind of beasts of pasture or of prey, no fruit, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERB\">herb</a>, no root fit for supporting the life of man. Yet as the climate was so good, and the soil appeared fertile, some gentlemen of small fortune in England resolved to become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ADVENTURERS\">adventurers</a> thither. The trees were so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, and of a wood so hard and stubborn, that it was with great difficulty they could clear as much ground as was necessary for their subsistence. By unremitting perseverance, however, they brought it to yield them a tolerable support; and they found that cotton and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a> agreed well with the soil; and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>, which was beginning to come into repute in England, answered tolerably. These proposals, together with the storm between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, which was beginning to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> out in England, induced many new adventurers to transport themselves into this island. And what is extremely\nBarbadoes tremely remarkable, so great was the increafe of people in Barbadoes, 25 years after its firft settlement, that in 1650 it contained more than 50,000 whites, and a much greater number of negro and Indian slaves. The latter they acquired by means not at all to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>: for they feized upon all thofe unhappy men, without any pretence, in the neighbouring islands, and carried them into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>; a practice which has rendered the Caribbee Indians irreconcilable to us ever since. They had begun a little before this to cultivate sugar, which soon rendered them extremely wealthy. The number of slaves, therefore, was still augmented; and in 1676 it is supposed that their number amounted to 100,000, which, together with 50,000 whites, make 150,000 on this small spot; a degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> unknown in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>, or any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the world most renowned for numbers. At this time Barbadoes employed 400 sail of ships, one with another of 150 tons, in their trade. Their annual exports, in sugar, indigo, ginger, cotton, and citron-water, were above 350,000l. and their circulating cash at home was 200,000l. Such was the increafe of population, trade, and wealth, in the course of 50 years. But since that time this island has been much on the decline; which is to be attributed partly to the growth of the French sugar colonies, and partly to our own eftablifhments in the neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIDES\">fides</a>.

According to some, the Romans, after they had conquered this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> country, gave it that name out of contempt and dislike to the barbarous manners of the natives, according to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of calling all other people but themselves Barbarians. Marmol on the contrary, derives the word Barbary from Berber, a name which the Arabs gave to its ancient inhabitants, and which they retain to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> in many parts of the country, especially along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> ridge of the mountains of Atlas; and which name was given them on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the barrenness of their country. According to Leo Africanus, the name of Barbary was given by the Arabs on account of the strange <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of the natives, which appeared to them more like a murmur or grumbling of some brute animals than articulate sounds. Others, however, derive it from the Arabic word <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>, signifying a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a>, twice repeated; which was given by one Ifric, or Africus, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, from whom the whole continent of Africa is pretended to have taken its name. According to them, this king being driven out of his own dominions, and closely pursued by his enemies, some of his retinue called out to him Bar, Bar; that is, To the desert, To the desert; from which the country was afterwards called Barbary.\n\nAmong the Romans this country was divided into the provinces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAURITANIA\">Mauritania</a>, Africa Propria, &c., and they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> masters of it from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of Julius Caesar till the year of Christ 428. At that time Bonifacius the Roman governor of these provinces, having through the treachery of Atius been forced to revolt, called in to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> Geniferic king of the Vandals, who had been some time settled in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>. The terms offered, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-PROCOPIUS\">Procopius</a>, were, that Geniferic should have two thirds, and Bonifacius one third, of Africa, provided they could maintain themselves against the Roman power; and to accomplish this they were to assist each other to the utmost.\u2014This proposal was instantly complied with; and Geniferic set sail from Spain in May 428, with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of 80,000 men, according to some, or only 24,000 according to others, together with their wives, children, and all their effects. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, however, the empress Placidia having discovered the true cause of Bonifacius's revolt, wrote a most kind and obliging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to him, in which she assured him of her favour and protection for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a>, exhorting him to return to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a>, and exert his usual zeal for the welfare of the empire, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DRIVING\">driving</a> out the Barbarians whom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALICE\">malice</a> of his enemies had obliged him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> in for his own safety and preservation.\n\nBonifacius readily complied with this request, and Endeavours offered the Vandals considerable sums if they would retire out of Africa and return to Spain. But Genefrude then first returned a scoffing answer, and then, falling unexpectedly on him, cut most of his men to pieces, and obliged Bonifacius himself to fly to Hippo, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> he invested in May 430. The siege lasted till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of July the following year; when the Vandals were forced, by a famine that began to rage in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>, to drop the enterprise, and retire. Soon after, Bonifacius having received two reinforcements, one from Rome, and the other, under the conduct of the celebrated Aspar, from Constantinople, a revolution was taken by the Roman generals to offer the enemy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>. The Vandals readily accepting the challenge, a bloody engagement ensued, in which the Romans were utterly defeated, a prodigious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of them taken, and the rest obliged to shelter themselves among the rocks and mountains. Aspar, who commanded the eastern troops, escaped with difficulty to Constantinople, and Bonifacius was recalled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>. Upon their departure, the Vandals overran all Africa, committing everywhere the most terrible ravages; which struck the inhabitants of Hippo with such terror, that they abandoned their city, which was first plundered, and then set on fire by the victorious enemy; so that Cirta and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a> were now the only strong places possessed by the Romans.\n\nIn 435, Geniferic, probably being afraid of an attack by the united forces of the eastern and western empires, concluded a peace with the Romans, who yielded to him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMIDIA\">Numidia</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Proconsularis, and likewise Byzancene; for which, according to Prosper, he was to pay a yearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUTE\">tribute</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> of the east. Geniferic delivered up his son Hunneric by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSTAGE\">hostage</a>; but so great was the confidence which the Romans placed in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARBARIAN\">Barbarian</a>, that some time after they sent him back his son. Of this they soon had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to repent; for in 439, the Romans being engaged in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHS\">Goths</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a>, Geniferic laid hold of that opportunity to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> upon the city of Carthage; by which he considerably enlarged his African dominions. Valentinian, the Roman emperor, however, maintained as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as he lived the two Mauritaniias, with Tripolitana, Tingitana, and that part of Numidia where Cirta stood.\n\nOn the taking of Carthage, Geniferic made it the seat of his empire; and in 440 made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> on the illand\nBarbaria. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, where he ravaged the open country, and even laid siege to Palermo. Not being able, however, to reduce that place, he soon returned to Africa with an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOOTY\">booty</a> and a vast number of captives. Being now become formidable to both empires, Theodosius emperor of the east resolved to assist Valentinian against so powerful an enemy. Accordingly, he fitted out a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> consisting of 1100 large ships; and putting on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> of it the flower of his army, under the conduct of Arcovindas, Anfilus, and Germanus, he ordered them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a> in Africa, and, joining the western forces there, to drive Genefric out of the countries he had seized. But Genefric in the mean time pretending a desire to be reconciled with both empires, amused the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> with proposals of peace, till the season for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> was over; and, next year, Theodosius being obliged to recall his forces to oppose the Huns, Valentinian found it necessary to conclude a peace with the Vandals; and this he could obtain on no other terms than yielding to them the quiet possession of the countries they had seized.\n\nSo powerful was Genefric now become, or rather so low was the Roman empire by this time reduced, that in 45 he took and plundered the city of Rome itself, as is fully related under the article ROME; and, after his return to Africa, made himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the remaining countries held by the Romans in that part of the world. Hereupon Avitus, who had succeeded Valentinian in the empire, despatched ambassadors to Genefric, putting him in mind of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> he had concluded with the empire in 442; and threatening, if he did not observe the articles at that time agreed upon, to make war upon him not only with his own forces, but with those of his allies the Vefigoths, who were ready to pass over into Africa. To this Genefric was so far from paying any regard, that he immediately put to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> with a fleet of 60 ships; but being attacked by the Roman fleet under Ricimer, he was utterly defeated, and forced to fly back into Africa: he returned, however, soon after with a more powerful fleet, committing great ravages on the coast of Italy; but in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> expedition he was not attended with so good success; the Romans falling unexpectedly upon his men while buried in plundering the country, put great numbers of them to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, and among the rest the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of Genefric himself. Not content with this small advantage, Majorianus, at that time emperor, resolved to pass over into Africa, and attempt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> of that country. For this purpose he made great preparations; but his fleet being surprized and defeated by the Vandals, through the treachery, it is said, of some of his commanders, the enterprise miscarried.\n\nNotwithstanding this misfortune, however, Majorianus persisted in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>; and would in all likelihood have accomplished his purpose, had not he himself been murdered soon after by Ricimer. After his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, Genefric committed what ravages he pleased in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> remains of the western empire, and even made descents on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PELOPONNESUS\">Peloponnesus</a> and the islands belonging to the emperor of Constantinople. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> this affront, Leo made vast preparations for the invasion of Africa, infomuch, that, according to Procopius, he laid out 130,000 pounds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> in the equipment of his army and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>. The forces employed on this occasion were sufficient for expelling the Vandals, had they been much more powerful than they were; but the command being given to Basiliscus a covetous and ambitious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, the fleet was utterly defeated through his treachery, and all the vast preparations came to nothing. By this last defeat the power of the Vandals in Africa was fully established, and Genefric made himself master of Sicily, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as of all the other islands between Italy and Africa, without opposition from the western emperors, whose power was entirely taken away in the year 476.\n\nThus was the Vandalic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a> in Barbary founded by Genefric, between the years 428 and 468. If we take a view of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> in his new domain, it presents no very agreeable prospect. Being himself an absolute barbarian in the strictest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of the word, and an utter stranger to every useful art, he did not fail to show his own prowess by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of all the monuments of Roman greatness which were so numerous in the country he had conquered. Accordingly, instead of improving his country, he laid it waste, by demolishing all the stately structures both public and private, and all other valuable and sumptuous works with which those proud conquerors had adorned this part of their dominions. So that, whatever monuments the Romans had been at such an immense expense to erect, in order to eternalize their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, the barbarous Vandals were now at no less pains to reduce into heaps of ruins. Besides this kind of devastations, Genefric made his dominions a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of blood and slaughter, by persecuting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORTHODOX\">orthodox</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>; being himself, as well as most of his countrymen, a zealous Arian; and for this his long reign is chiefly remarkable. He died in 477, after a reign of 60 years; and was succeeded by his son Hunneric.\n\nThe new king proved yet a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a> than his father, persecuting the orthodox with the utmost fury; bloody tyranny, during his short reign of seven years and a half, destroyed more of them than Genefric had done in all his lifetime. He is said to have died in the same manner as the heresiarch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARIUS\">Arius</a> *, before which time his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> had been rotting upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>, and crawling with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>, so that he looked more like a dead carcass than a living man. Concerning his successors Guatamund, Thratamund, and Hilderic, we find nothing remarkable, except that they sometimes persecuted, and sometimes were favourable to, the orthodox; and by his favour for them the last king was ruined. For, having unadvisedly published, in the beginning of his reign, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANIFESTO\">manifesto</a>, wherein he repealed all the acts of his predecessors against the orthodox, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REBELLION\">rebellion</a> was the immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the malcontents was one Gilimer, or Gildemar, a prince of the blood-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a>, who by degrees became so powerful, as to depose Hilderic in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a> year of his reign; after which he caused the unhappy monarch, with all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, to be closely confined, and was himself crowned king of the Vandals at Carthage.\n\nGilimer proved a greater tyrant than any that had gone before him. He not only cruelly persecuted the orthodox, but horribly oppressed all the rest, so that he was held in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> abhorrence and detestation when the Greek emperor Justinian projected an invasion of Africa. This expedition of Justinian's is said to have\nhave been occasioned by an apparition of Laetus an African bishop, who had been murdered some time before, but now commanded the emperor to attempt the recovery of Africa, and assured him of success. Accordingly, this, or some other motive, prevailed upon Justinian so far, that notwithstanding his being at that time engaged in a war with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, he sent a powerful fleet and army to Africa, under the command of the celebrated general Belifarius, who was for that reason recalled from Persia.\n\nSo much was Gilimer, all this time, taken up with his own pleasures, or with oppressing his subjects, that he knew little or nothing of the formidable preparations that were making against him. On the arrival of Belifarius, however, he was constrained to put himself into a posture of defense. The management of his army he committed to his two brothers Gundimer and Gelanund, who accordingly attacked the Romans at the head of a numerous force. The engagement was long and bloody; but at last the Vandals were defeated, and the two princes slain. Gilimer, grown desperate at this news, fell out at the head of his corps de reserve, with full purpose to renew the attack with the utmost vigour; but by his own indiscrimation lost a fair opportunity of defeating the Romans. For no sooner did they perceive Gilimer hastening after them at the head of a fresh army, than they betook themselves to flight; and the greatest part were dispersed in such a manner, that, had the king followed them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>, they must have been totally cut off. Instead of this, however, stumbling unfortunately on the body of one of his slain brothers, the sight of it made him lose all thoughts about the enemy; and instead of pursuing them, he spent part of his time in idle lamentations, and part in burying the corpse with suitable pomp and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>. By this means Belifarius had an opportunity of rallying his men; which he did to effectually, that, coming unexpectedly upon Gilimer, he easily gained a new and complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a> over him.\n\nThis defeat was followed by the loss of Carthage, which the barbarians had been at no pains to put into a posture of defense. After which Gilimer, having in vain endeavoured to obtain assistance from the Moors and Goths, was obliged to recede his brother Tzalon from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDINIA\">Sardinia</a>. The meeting between the two brothers was very mournful; but they soon came to a resolution of making one desperate attempt to regain the lost kingdom, or at least recover their captives out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the enemy. The consequence of his resolution was another engagement, in which Tzalon was killed with 800 of his choicest men, while the Romans lost no more than 50; after which Belifarius moving suddenly forward at the head of all his army, fell upon the camp of the Vandals. This Gilimer was no sooner apprised of, than, without staying to give any more orders to the rest of his army, he fled towards Numidia in the utmost consternation. His flight was not immediately known among his troops; but when it was, such an universal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> ensued, that they abandoned their camp to the Romans, who had now nothing to do but plunder it; and not content with this, they massacred all the men found in it, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> away the women captives.\n\nThus a total end was put to the power of the Vandals in Barbary, and the Romans once more became masters of this country. The Vandal inhabitants were permitted to remain as they were, on condition of exchanging the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a> of Arius for the orthodox <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>. As for Gilimer, he fled with the utmost expedition to Medamus, a town situated on the top of the Pappum mountain, and almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INACCESSIBLE\">inaccessible</a> by reason of its height and ruggedness. The siege of this place was committed to Pharas, an officer of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, who having shut up all avenues to the town, the unhappy Gilimer was reduced to the greatest straits for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>. Pharas being soon apprized of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> distresses he was in, wrote him a most friendly and pathetic letter, earnestly exhorting him to put an end to the distresses of himself and his friends by a surrender. This Gilimer declined; but at the same time concluded his answer with a most submissive request, that Pharas would so far pity his great distresses as to lend him a loaf of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, a sponge, and a lute. This strange request greatly surprized Pharas; but at last it was explained by the messenger, who told him that the king had not tasted any baked bread since his arrival on that mountain, and earnestly longed to eat a morsel of it before he died: the sponge he wanted to allay a tumour that was fallen on one of his eyes; and the lute, on which he had learned to play, was to assist him in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> some elegiac verses he had composed on the subject of his misfortunes to a suitable tune. At this mournful report Pharas could not restrain from tears, and immediately despatched the messenger with the things he wanted.\n\nGilimer had spent near three winter months on the summit of this inhospitable mountain, his misery hardening him still more against the thoughts of surrendering, when a melancholy scene in his own family at once reconciled him to it. This was a bloody struggle between two boys, one of them his sister's son, about a flat bit of dough, laid on the coals; which the one feasted upon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> hot as it was, and clapped it into his mouth; but the other by dint of blows forced it out, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATE\">ate</a> it from him. This quarrel, which might have ended fatally had not Gilimer interposed, made so deep an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> upon him, that he immediately despatched a messenger to Pharas, acquainting him that he was willing to surrender himself and all his effects upon the conditions he had offered, as soon as he was assured that they were embraced by Belifarius. Pharas lost no time to get them ratified and sent back to him; after which he was conducted to Belifarius, who gave him a very kind reception. Gilimer was afterwards brought before Justinian in gold chains, whom he besought in the most submissive manner to spare his life. This was readily granted by the emperor; who kindly also allowed him a handsome yearly pension to live up-treated by on as a private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>. But his mind and heart Justinian were too much unsettled and broken to enjoy the sweets of a private state; so that Gilimer, opprest with grief, died in the year 534, the first of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a>, and five years after he had been raised to the throne.\n\nBarbary being thus again reduced under the power of the Romans, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> falls to be taken notice of under that of Rome. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALIPHATE\">caliphate</a> of Omar, this Barbary country was reduced by the Saracens, as we have already related under the article Arabia. It continued the Saracens subject to the caliphs of Arabia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAGDAD\">Bagdad</a> till the reign of Harun Al Raschid, who having appointed Ibrah\u00edm\nIbrahim Ibn Aglab governor of the western parts of his empire, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREFECT\">prefect</a> took the opportunity, first of affuming greater powers to himself than had been granted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALIPH\">caliph</a>, and then erecting a principality altogether independent of the caliphs. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of Aglab continued to enjoy their new principality peaceably till the year of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEGIRA\">Hegira</a> 297 or 298, during which time they made several defcants on the island of Sicily, and conquered part of it. About this time, however, one Obidallah rebelled against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of Aglab, and assumed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of caliph of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KAIRWAN\">Kairwan</a> (the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CYRENE\">Cyrene</a>, and residence of the Aglabite princes). To give the greater weight to his pretensions he also took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SURNAME\">surname</a> of Al Mohdi, or Al Mahedi, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a>. According to some, also, he pretended to be descended in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> line from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALI\">Ali</a> Ibn Abu Taleb, and Fatema the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Mahomet; for which reason, say they, the Arabs called him and his descendants Fatemites. He likewise encouraged himself and his followers by a traditional prophecy of Mahomet, that at the end of 300 years the sun should rise out of the west. Having at length driven the Aglabites into Egypt, where they became known by the name of Magrebianus, he extended his dominions in Africa and Sicily, making Kairwan the place of his residence.\n\nIn the 300th year of the Hegira, Habbafah, one of Al Mohdi's generals, overthrew the caliph Al Mokhtader's forces in the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARCA\">Barca</a>, and made himself master of that city. After which he reduced Alexandria itself; and was making great progress in the conquest of the whole country, when Al Mokhtader despatched against him his two generals Takin and Al Kafem, with an army of 100,000 men. Habbafah being informed that the caliph's troops were in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, advanced at the head of his army to give them battle, and at last came up with them in an island called by the Arabs Ard Al Khamsin. Here he attacked them with incredible bravery, notwithstanding their force was much superior to his; but the approach of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> obliged both generals to found a retreat.\u2014The action therefore was by no means decisive, though extremely bloody, the caliph's generals having lost 20,000, and Habbafah 10,000. The latter, however, durst not renew the fight next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOLE\">stole</a> off in the night, and returned home, so that Al Mokhtader in effect gained a victory. In the 302nd year of the Hegira, however, Habbafah returned, possessed himself of Alexandria a second time, defeated a body of the caliph's forces, and killed 7000 of them upon the spot. What further progress he made at that time we are not certainly told; but in the 307th year of the Hegira, Abul Kafem, son to the Fatemite caliph Al Mohdi, again entered Egypt with an army of 100,000 men. At first he met with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> success, and overran a considerable part of that fine country. He made himself master of Alexandria, Al Tayum, Al Baknafa, and the ilfe of Al Ashmaryn, penetrating even to Al Jizah, where the caliph's army under the command of Munes was posted in order to oppose him. In this country he found means to maintain himself till the 308th year of the Hegira. This year, however, he was entirely defeated by Munes, who made himself master of all his baggage, as well as of the plunder he had acquired; and this blow obliged him to fly to Kairwan with the shattered remains of his army, where he remained without making any further attempt on Egypt.\n\nAl Mohdi reigned 24 years; and was succeeded by his son Abul Kafem above-mentioned, who then took the surname Al Kayem Mohdi. During his reign we read of nothing remarkable, except the revolt of one Yazid Ibn Condat, a man of mean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a>, but who, having been raised to the dignity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a>, found means to raise such a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTY\">party</a>, that the caliph Rebellion was obliged to shut himself up in the castle of Mohedia, of Yazid. Yazid, being then at the head of a powerful army, soon reduced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of Kairwan, the cities of Al Rakkada and Tunis, and several other fortresses. He was no less successful in defeating a considerable number of troops which Al Kayem had raised and sent against him; after which he closely besieged the caliph himself in the castle where he had shut himself up. The siege continued seven months; during which time the place was reduced to such straits, that the caliph must either have surrendered it or been starved, when death put an end to his anxiety in the 12th year of his reign, and 334th of the Hegira.\n\nAl Kayem was succeeded by his son Ishmael, who Al Manfur immediately took upon himself the title of Al Mansur, caliph. This caliph thought proper to conceal the death of his father till he had made the preparations necessary for reducing the rebels. In this he was so successful that he obliged Yazid to raise the siege of Mohedia the same year; and in the following gave him two great overthrows, obliging him to shut himself up in the fortress of Kothama, or Cutama, where he besieged him in his turn. Yazid defended the place a long time with desperate bravery; but finding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARRISON\">garrison</a> at last obliged to capitulate, he made shift to escape privately. Al Manfur immediately despatched a body of forces in pursuit of him; who overtook, and brought him back in fetters; but not till after a vigorous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, in which Yazid received several dangerous wounds, of which he died in prison. After his death, Al Manfur caused his death of body to be flayed, and his skin stuffed and exposed to public view. Of Al Manfur's exploits in Sicily an account is given under that article. Nothing farther remarkable happened in his African dominions; and he died after a reign of seven years and 16 days, in the 341st of the Hegira.\n\nAl Manfur was succeeded by his son Abu Zammin Al Moez Moad, who assumed the surname of Al Moez Lednin-Ledninillah lab. He proved a very warlike prince, and maintained caliph a bloody contest with Abdalrahman, caliph of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANDALUSIA\">Andalusia</a>; for a particular account of which see the article Spain. In the 347th year of the Hegira, beginning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 25th, 958, Al Moez sent a powerful army to the western extremity of Africa, under the command of Abul Hasan Jawhar, one of his slaves, whom he had advanced to the dignity of vizir. Jawhar first advanced to a city called Tchert, which he besieged for some time ineffectually. From thence he marched to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEZ\">Fez</a>, and made proper dispositions for attacking that city. But finding that Ahmed Ebn Beer, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMIR\">emir</a> of the place, was resolved to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> it to the last, he thought proper to abandon the enterprise. However, having traversed all the tract between that capital and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATLANTIC_OCEAN\">Atlantic <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>, he again sat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> before Fez, and took it by storm the following year.\nBut the greatest achievement performed by this caliph was his conquest of Egypt, and the removal of the caliphate to that country. This conquest, though long projected, he did not attempt till the year of the Hegira 358. Having then made all necessary preparations for it, he committed the care of that expedition to a faithful and experienced general called Gufar, or Yafaf; but in the mean time, this enterprise did not divert Al Moez from the care of his other conquests, particularly those of Sicily and Sardinia: to the last of which he failed in the year of the Hegira 361, continuing a whole year in it, and leaving the care of his African dominions to an experienced officer named Yulef Ben Zeiri. He failed thence the following year for Tripoli in Barbary, where he had not stayed long before he received the agreeable news that his general had made himself master of Alexandria. He lost no time, but immediately embarked for it, leaving the government of his old African dominions in the hands of his truly fervent Yulef above-mentioned, and arriving safely at that port was received with all the demonstrations of joy. Here he began to lay the foundations of his new Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYNASTY\">dynasty</a>, which was to put a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> end to the old one of Kairwan after it had continued about 65 years.\n\nAl Moez preserved all his old dominions of Kairwan or Africa Proper. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a> or avarice of the governors whom he appointed suffered them to run quickly to a shameful decay; particularly the new and opulent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> of Mohedia, on which immense sums had been lavished, as well as labour and care, so as to render it not only one of the richest and most illustrious cities in the world: so that we may truly say, the wealth and splendor of this once famed, though short-lived state, took their final leave of it with the departure of the caliph Al Moez, seeing the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> tract from the Egyptian confines to the straits of Gibraltar hath since become the nest of the most odious piratical crew that can be imagined.\n\nUnder the article Algiers we have given a short account of the erection of a new kingdom in Barbary by Texefen; which, however, is there no farther continued than is necessary for the proper understanding the history of that country. A general history might here be given of the whole country of Barbary; but as that would necessarily occasion repetitions under the articles Morocco, Tripoli, Tunis, &c., we must refer to those articles for the historical part, as well as for an account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, inhabitants, &c.\n\nBarbatelli, Bernardino, otherwise called Pochetti, a painter of history, fruit, animals, and flowers, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a> in 1542. He was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Ridolfo Ghirlandaio at Florence; from whose school he went to Rome, and studied there with such uncommon affluency, that he was frequently so absorbed, and so absolutely engrossed by the objects of his contemplations, as to forget the necessary refreshments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> and food. He was excellent for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of animals, fruit, or flowers; and in those subjects not only imitated, but equalled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. His touch was free, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and delicate, and the colouring of his objects inexplicably true; and, beside his merit in this most usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of painting, the historical subjects which he designed from sacred or profane authors were much esteemed and admired.

At first he was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Benedetto Gennari; but he afterwards studied for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> in the school of the Caracci, though he did not adopt the manner of that famous academy. He seemed to prefer the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CARAVAGGIO\">Caravaggio</a> to that of Guido <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBANO\">Albano</a>, imagining it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to imitate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> truly, without the affluence of strong lights and strong shadows; and from that principle, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> was admitted into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> room from above. In effect, by the opposition of his strong lights and shadows, he gave such force to his pictures, that few, except those of Caravaggio, can stand near them, and not seem feeble in their effect: however, that manner is censured as not being like nature, because it makes objects appear as if they were seen by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a>-light, or by the brightness of a sun-beam, which alone can justify the deepness of his shadowing. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of Guercino seems to have been fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> arriving at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> in colouring; he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the astonishing effects produced by the colouring of the celebrated Venetian masters; and observed, that notwithstanding any imperfections in regard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a>, correctness, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a>, the works of these masters were the objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> admiration. From which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, he seems to have devoted his whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> to excel in colouring; as if he were convinced, that few are qualified to discern the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of thought, which constitutes the excellence of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>; few may be touched with the grandeur or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, or perhaps have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> to examine even the correctness of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a painting; and yet every eye, and even every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> judge of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>, may be sensibly affected by the force and beauty of the colouring.

Towards the decline of his life, he observed that the clearer and brighter style of Guido and Albano had attracted the admiration of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>; and therefore he altered his manner, even against his own judgment. But he apologized for that conduct, by declaring, that in his former time he painted for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, and to please the judicious; and he now painted to please the ignorant, and enrich himself.

Most probably the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> towns are under the protection of the Porte: but whether under the bailiwick of Egypt or Tripoli, or whether they have formed themselves into independent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> like those of Algiers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TUNIS\">Tunis</a>, we cannot say; only we are told that the inhabitants of the maritime towns are more civilized than those that dwell in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INLAND\">inland</a> parts. The first professed Mahometanism, and have imbibed some notions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>; whilst the latter, who have neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> nor any sign of worship among them, are altogether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> and brutish. They are a sort of Arabs, and like them live entirely upon theft and plunder. By them this tract, which before was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> desert, was first inhabited. At their first coming in, they settled themselves in one of the best places of the country; but as they multiplied, and had frequent wars with one another, the strongest drove the weakest out of the best spots, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARCELONA\">Barcelona</a> sent them to wander in the desert parts, where they live in the most miserable manner, their country hardly affording one single necessary of life. Hence it is that they are said to be the ugliest of all the Arabs: their bodies having scarcely any thing but skin and bone, their faces meagre, with fierce ravenous looks; their garb, which is commonly what they take from the passengers who go through these parts, tattered with long wearing; while the poorest of them have scarce a rag to cover their nakedness. They are most expert and resolute robbers, that being their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> employment and livelihood; but the travellers in these parts are so few, that the Barcans are often necessitated to make distant excursions into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMIDIA\">Numidia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBYA\">Libya</a>, and other southern countries. Those that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> are made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRINK\">drink</a> plenty of warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>; then they hang them up by the feet, and shake them, in order to make them vomit up any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> they think they have swallowed; after which, they strip them of all their clothes, even to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> rag: but with all this inhumanity, they commonly spare their life, which is more than the other African robbers do. Yet notwithstanding every artifice they can use, the Barcans are so poor, that they commonly let, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEDGE\">pledge</a>, or even sell, their children to the Sicilians and others from whom they have their corn, especially before they set out on any long excursion.","sp":447,"ep":447},{"h":"BARCALON","t":"an appellation given to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a> minister of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIAM\">Siam</a>.

This city was originally founded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAMILCAR_BARCAS\">Hamilcar Barcas</a>, and from him called Barcino. It was reduced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> subject to them till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of Spain was overrun by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHS\">Goths</a> and Vandals, and afterwards by the Saracens <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Moors. In the beginning of the 9th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, Barcelona was in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the Moors, and under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of one Zade. This governor having more than once abused the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLEMENCY\">clemency</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLEMAGNE\">Charlemagne</a>, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> irritated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEWIS\">Lewis</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Aquitain, and son to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a>, to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, that he gave orders to his generals to invest the city, and not to rise from before it till they had put Zade into his hands. The Moor made a most obstinate resistance, so that the siege lasted many months: at last, finding it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to preserve the city much longer, and being destitute of all hopes of relief, he determined, or rather was compelled by the inhabitants, to go to the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a> and implore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>'s mercy; but here he was no sooner arrived than he was arrested and sent prisoner to Charlemagne, who condemned him to perpetual banishment. The people gaining nothing by this expedient, continued to hold out for six weeks longer, when the king of Aquitain himself took the command of the siege. To him they made a proposal, that if he would allow them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> out and go where they pleased, they would surrender the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. Lewis having agreed to this, made his public entry into Barcelona, where he formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of extending his father's dominions as far as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EBRO\">Ebro</a>; but being recalled before he could put his design in execution,\nBarcelona, he appointed one Bera <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> of Barcelona. The city continued subject to him and his successors, who still enjoyed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of counts of Barcelona, from the year 802 to 1131; during which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> we find nothing remarkable, except that the city was once taken by the Moors, but soon after retaken by the affluence of Lewis IV. king of France. In 1131 it was united to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of Arragon by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Raymond V. count of Barcelona with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Don Ramiro the monk, king of Arragon. In 1465 the Catalonians revolted against Don Juan II. king of Arragon, out of hatred to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> Donna Juanna; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which was, that Barcelona was besieged by that monarch in 1471. Various efforts were made by Lewis XI. of France and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Lorraine in order to raise the siege, but without effect. Things at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> were brought to the utmost extremity, when the king offered to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> them all, without the smallest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> either in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, provided they would submit; but these terms they rejected, chiefly through the influence of the Count de Pailhars, who had been pardoned the year before. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, was very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> on being led on to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSAULT\">assault</a>, in hopes of plunder. The king, however, wrote a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to the citizens, dated the 6th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a>, in terms as affectionate as if he had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> to his children, bewailing the miseries they had brought on themselves, and concluding with a protestation that they, and not he, must be answerable for the consequences. Upon this, at the persuasion of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> who had a reputation for sanctity, they sent deputies to the king, and made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a> on the 17th of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>. In this the king acknowledged they had taken up arms on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> motives; and forgave everybody except Pailhars, who was, however, suffered to escape.\n\nOn the 22d of October the king made his entry into the city, and confirmed all their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> privileges. In 1697, Barcelona was taken by the French, after a bloody siege of 52 days; and the loss of this city had a considerable effect in disposing the Spaniards to agree to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> of Ryswick. In Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>'s time it was taken by the allies under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Peterborough; but being afterwards shamefully denied affluence by the English ministry, was obliged to submit to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> II. by whom the whole province was deprived of its ancient privileges; for a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of which, see the article Spain.\n\nBarcelona is situated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-side, of a form between a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> and an oval. It is surrounded with a good brick wall, round which is another, with 14 battlements, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>-works, ramparts, and ditches; the ramparts are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and spacious, inasmuch that 100 coaches may be seen every evening <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DRIVING\">driving</a> thereon for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. The city is divided into two parts, the Old and the New, which are separated from each other by a wall and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DITCH\">ditch</a>; the streets are handsome, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> paved with large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, wide, and very clean. It is the residence of the viceroy, is a bishop's see, has a fine university, a mint, a good port, and is adorned with handsome buildings. Here is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INQUISITION\">inquisition</a>, which the inhabitants look upon as an advantage. The remarkable buildings are the cathedral, which is large, handsome, and adorned with two high towers, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of the Virgin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of the bishop, that of the inquisition, and several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> houses; add to these the palace of the viceroy; the arsenal, which contains arms for 1000 men; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a>, where the merchants meet; the taverna, where they build the galleys; and the palace where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> meet, called La <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASA\">Casa</a> de la <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTATION\">Deputation</a>. This last is built with fine large freestone, and adorned with columns of marble: there is in it a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HALL\">hall</a>, with a gilt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CEILING\">ceiling</a> and a handsome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PORTICO\">portico</a>, wherein persons may either walk or sit; the hall is adorned with the portraits of all the counts of Barcelona. There are several fine squares, particularly that of St Michael, into which all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> streets run. The port is wide, spacious, deep, and safe; defended on the one side by a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol7.html#article-MOLE\">mole</a>, and on the other sheltered from the west wind by two mountains that advance into the sea, and form a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMONTORY\">promontory</a>: the mole is 750 paces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, with a quay, at the end of which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> and a small fort. One of the mountains, called Mont Joy, is very high, and rises in the middle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> near the city: it is covered with gardens, vineyards, groves of trees, and has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the city. This mountain, being a rock, yields an inexhaustible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARRY\">quarry</a> of fine hard freestone. Barcelona is a place of great trade, on account of the conveniency of its harbour; and it has a manufacture of knives greatly esteemed in Spain, as also of blakets. Here are also several glass-houses. The inhabitants are diligent, and equally fit for labour and trade; they are also very civil to strangers. The women are well shaped, and as handsome as any in Spain; they are brisk and lively in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a>, and more free and unrestrained in their behaviour than in other parts of Spain.

In 1573 he went over to France, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOURGES\">Bourges</a> commenced student of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CIVIL_LAW\">civil <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> under the famous Cujacius. He continued some years in that seminary, where he took a doctor's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>; and was soon after appointed professor of civil law in the university of Pont-\u00e0-Mousson, the first founded by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Lorraine. That <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> afterwards made him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNSELLOR\">counsellor</a> of state and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of requests. Barclay, in the year 1581, married <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol3.html#article-ANN\">Ann</a> de Mallaville, a French lady, by whom he had a son, who became a celebrated author, and of whom the reader <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> find an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> in the next article. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a> the Jesuits would gladly have received into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>. His father refused his consent, and for that reason these disciples of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> soon contrived to ruin him with the duke his patron. Barclay now embarked for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">King</a> James I. offered him considerable preferment, provided he would become a member of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of England; but not choosing to comply, he returned to France in 1624; and, soon after his arrival, was appointed professor of civil law in the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGERS\">Angers</a>, where he died the year following, and was buried in the Franciscan church. He was esteemed a learned civilian; and wrote elaborately in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of kings, in answer to Buchanan and others. The titles of his works are, 1. *De regno et regali potestate*, &c. 2. *Commentarius in tit. pandectarum de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REBUS\">rebus</a> creditis, et de jure jurando*. 3. *De potestate pap\u00e6*, &c. 4. *Primitia in vitam Agricol\u00e6*.\n\nBarclay, John, son of the former, was, as we have above mentioned, so great a favourite of the Jesuits, that they used all their efforts to engage him in their society. His father would not consent, and carried his son with him into England, who was already an author, for he had published \"A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMENTARY\">Commentary</a> upon Barclay on the Thebais of Statius,\" and a Latin poem on the coronation of King James, and the first part of *Euphorbia*, 1603. He returned to France with his father; and after his father's death went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, and soon after came back to London; he was there in 1626. He published \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">Gunpowder</a> Plot,\" a pamphlet of six leaves, printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a>. He published at London in 1610 \"An Apology for the Euphorbia,\" and his father's treatise *De potestate pap\u00e6*. And at Paris, 1612, he published a book entitled *Pietas*, in answer to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Bellarmine, who had written against William Barclay's book concerning the power of the Pope. Two years after he published *Icon Animorum*. He was invited to Rome by Pope Paul V. and received a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of civility from Cardinal Bellarmine, though he had written against him. He died at Rome in 1621, while his *Argenis* was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> at Paris. This celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> has since gone through a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of editions, and has been translated into most languages. M. de Peirello, who had the care of the first edition, caused the effigies of the author to be placed before the book; and the following epitaph, written by Grotius, was put under it:\n\n*Gente Caledonius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GALLUS\">Gallus</a> natalibus, hic est, Romam Romano qui docet ore loqui.*\n\nBarclay, Robert, one of the most eminent among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUAKERS\">Quakers</a>, the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> Barclay, descended of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> family of Barcleys, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> in 1648. He was educated under an uncle at Paris, where the Papists used all their efforts to draw him over to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. He joined the Quakers in 1669, and distinguished himself by his zeal and abilities in defence of their doctrines. In 1676 he published in Latin at Amsterdam his \"Apology for the Quakers;\" which is the most celebrated of his works, and esteemed the standard of the doctrine of the Quakers. The *Thebes Theologicae*, which were the foundation of this work, and addressed to the clergy of what sort soever, were published before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> of the *Apology*, and printed in Latin, French, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">High</a>-Dutch, Low-Dutch, and English. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEDICATION\">dedication</a> of his *Apology* to King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> II., is very remarkable for the uncommon frankness and simplicity with which it is written. Amongst many other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>, we meet with the following: \"There is no king in the world who can so experimentally testify of God's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">providence</a> and goodness; neither is there any who rules so many free people, so many true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>; which thing renders thy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a>, thyself more considerable, than the accession of many nations filled with lascivious and superstitious souls.

When he returned to his native country he spent the remainder of his life in a quiet and retired manner. He died at his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> at Ury on the 3rd of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a> 1690, in the 42nd year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>.","sp":448,"ep":450},{"h":"BARCOCHEBAS","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> rather BARCOCHAB, a Jewish impostor, whose real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AKIBA\">Akiba</a>; but he took that of Barcochab, which signifies the Son of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">Star</a>; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLUSION\">allusion</a> to the prophecy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALAAM\">Balaam</a>, \"There shall a star arise out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a>.\" He proclaimed himself the Messiah; and talking of nothing but wars, victories, and triumphs, made his countrymen rise against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, by which means he was the author of innumerable disorders: he ravaged many places, took a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of fortresses, and massacred an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> multitude of people, particularly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> sent troops to Rufus, governor of Judea, to suppress the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEDITION\">sedition</a>. Rufus, in obedience, exercised a thousand cruelties, but could not finish his attempt. The emperor was therefore obliged to send Julius Severus, the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; who attained his end without a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>: he fell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> them separately; cut off their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>; and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> the whole contest was reduced to the siege of Bitter, in the 18th year of Hadrian.

An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, skill in instrumental music, and, above all, a poetical genius, are requisite to excel in that complicated art. As such talents are rare, the few that possessed them were highly esteemed; and hence the profession of a bard, which, beside <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> talents, required more culture and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> than any other known art. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BARDS\">Bards</a> were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> persons at every festival and at every solemnity. Their songs, which, by recording the achievements of kings and heroes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a> every hearer, must have been the entertainment of every warlike <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>. We have Hefod's authority, that in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> bards were as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> as potters or joiners, and as liable to envy. Demodocus is mentioned by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a> as a celebrated bard; and Phemius, another bard, is introduced by him deprecating the wrath of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ULYSSES\">Ulysses</a> in the following words:\n\n\"O <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">King</a>! to mercy be thy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> inclin'd,\n\"And spare the poet's ever-gentle kind:\n\"A deed like this thy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> would wrong,\n\"For dear to gods and men is sacred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SONG\">song</a>.\n\"Self-taught I sing; by heav'n, and heav'n alone,\n\"The genuine seeds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> are sown;\n\"And (what the gods bestow) the loft'x lay,\n\"To gods alone, and godlike worth, we pay.\"\n\nCicero reports, that at Roman festivals, anciently, the virtues and exploits of their great men were sung. The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> prevailed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a>, as we learn from Garcilasso and other authors. We have for our authority Father Gobien, that even the inhabitants of the Marian islands have bards, who are greatly admired, because in their songs are celebrated the feats of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>.\n\nBut in no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the world did the profession of bard appear with such lustre as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>. Wherever the Celts or Gauls are mentioned by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> writers, we seldom fail to hear of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRUIDS\">druids</a> and their bards; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> of which two orders, was the capital <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> of their manners Blair's Dif- and policy. The druids were their philosophers and fation, priests; the bards, their poets and recorders of heroic actions: and both these orders of men seem to have subjoined among them, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> members of the state, vol. ii. from time immemorial. The Celts possessed, from p. 306, very remote ages, a formed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> and manners, which appears to have had a deep and lasting influence. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMMIANUS_MARCELLINUS\">Ammianus Marcellinus</a> * gives them this Lib. xv. express testimony, that there flourished among them c. 9: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the most laudable arts; introduced by the bards, whose office it was to sing in heroic verse the gallant actions of illustrious men; and by the druids, who lived together in colleges or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>, after the Pythagorean manner, and philosophizing upon the highest subjects, asserted the immortality of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> soul. Though Julius Caesar, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of Gaul, does not expressly mention the bards; yet it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, that, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Druids, he comprehends that whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> or order; of which the bards, who, it is probable, were the disciples of the druids, undoubtedly made a part. It deserves remark, that, ac. 1. 6. according to his account, the druidical institution first took rise in Britain, and passed from thence into Gaul; so that they who aspired to be thorough masters of that learning were wont to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> to Britain. He adds too, that such as were to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INITIATED\">initiated</a> among the druids, were obliged to commit to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of verses, inasmuch that some employed 20 years in this course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>; and that they did not think it lawful to record these poems in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, but scarcely handed them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> to race.\n\nSo strong was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> of the Celtic nations to their poetry and their bards, that amidst all the changes of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> and manners, even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> after the order of the druids was extinct, and the national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> altered, the bards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to flourish; not as a set of trifling songsters, like the Greek \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 or \u1fe5\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u1f76, in Homer's time, but as an order of men highly respected in the state, and supported by a public establishment. We find them, according to the testimonies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRABO\">Strabo</a> and Diodorus, before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of Augustus Caesar; and we find them remaining under the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, and exercising the same functions as of old, in Ireland, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of Scotland, almost down to our own times. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> known, that, in both\nboth these countries, every regulus or chief had his own bard, who was considered as an officer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>.\n\nOf the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> in which the bards were held, many instances occur in Ossian\u2019s poems. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">On</a> all important occasions, they were the ambassadors between contending chiefs; and their persons were held sacred. \u201cCair-bor feared to stretch his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> to the bards, though his soul was dark. Loose the bards (said his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Cathmor), they are the sons of other times. Their voice shall be heard in other ages, when the kings of Temora have failed.\u201d\u2014The bards, as well as the druids, were exempted from taxes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> services, even in times of the greatest danger; and when they attended their patrons in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>, to record and celebrate their great actions, they had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> assigned them for their protection. At all festivals and public assemblies they were seated near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> of the king or chieftain, and sometimes even above the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> and chief officers of the court. Nor was the profession of the bards less lucrative than it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a>. For, besides the valuable presents which they occasionally received from their patrons when they gave them uncommon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> by their performances, they had estates in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a> allotted for their support. Nay, so great was the veneration which the princes of these times entertained for the persons of their poets, and so highly were they charmed and delighted with their tuneful strains, that they sometimes pardoned even their capital crimes for a song.\n\nWe may very reasonably suppose, that a profession that was at once so honourable and advantageous, and enjoyed so many flattering distinctions and desirable immunities, would not be deserted. It was indeed very much crowded; and the accounts which we have of the numbers of the bards in some countries, particularly in Ireland, are hardly credible. We often read, in the poems of Ossian, of a hundred bards belonging to one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SINGING\">singing</a> and playing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> for his entertainment. Every chief bard, who was called Al-lab Redan, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> in poetry, was allowed to have 30 bards of inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> constantly about his person; and every bard of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> rank was allowed a retinue of 15 poetical disciples.\n\nThough the ancient Britons of the southern parts of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> had originally the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and genius for poetry with those of the north, yet none of their poetical compositions of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> have been preserved. Nor have we any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to be surprised at this. For after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> Britons had submitted quietly to the Roman government, yielded up their arms, and had lost their free and martial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>, they could take little pleasure in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> or repeating the songs of their bards in honour of the glorious achievements of their brave ancestors. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> too, if they did not practise the same barbarous policy which was long after practised by Edward I. of putting the bards to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, would at least discourage them, and discountenance the repetition of their poems, for very obvious reasons. The sons of the song being thus persecuted by their conquerors, and neglected by their countrymen, either abandoned their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> or their profession; and their songs being no longer heard, were soon forgotten.\n\nIt is probable that the ancient Britons, as well as many other nations of antiquity, had no idea of poems that were made only to be repeated, and not to be sung to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> of musical instruments. In the first stages of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> in all countries, the two sister-arts of poetry and music seem to have been always united; every poet was a musician, and sang his own verses to the sound of some musical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>. This, we are directly told by two writers of undoubted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> in Gaul, and consequently in Britain, in this period. \u201cThe bards (says Diodorus Siculus) sang their poems to the sound of an instrument not unlike a fife, lyre.\u201d \u201cThe bards (according to Ammianus Marcellinus, as above hinted) celebrated the brave actions of illustrious men, in heroic poems, which they sang to the sweet sounds of the lyre.\u201d This account of these Greek and Latin writers is confirmed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRAIN\">strain</a>, and by many particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>, of the poems of Ossian. \u201cBeneath his own tree, at intervals, each bard sat down with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HARP\">harp</a>. They raised the song, and touched the string, each to the chief he loved.\u201d\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of writing made a considerable change in the bard profession. It is now an agreed point, that no poetry is fit to be accompanied with music, but what is simple: a complicated thought or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> requires the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, and leaves none for the music; or, if it divide the attention, it makes but a faint <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>. The simple operas of Quinault see the bear away the palm from everything of the kind composed by Boileau or Racine. But when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, in its progress to maturity, is enriched with variety of phrases fit to express the most elevated thoughts, men of genius aspired to the higher strains of poetry, leaving music and song to the bards: which distinguished the profession of a poet from that of a bard. Homer, in a lax <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, may be termed a bard; for in that character he strolled from feast to feast. But he was not a bard in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> sense: he, indeed, recited his poems to crowded audiences; but his poems are too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a> for music, and he probably did not sing them, nor accompany them with the lyre. The Trouv\u00e8res of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVENCE\">Provence</a> were bards in the original sense, and made a capital <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> in the days of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, when few could read, and fewer write. In later times, the songs of the bards were taken down in writing, which gave every one access to them without a bard; and the profession sunk by degrees into oblivion. Among the Highlanders of Scotland, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> and writing in their own tongue is not common even at present; and that circumstance supported long the bard profession among them, after being forgot among the neighbouring nations.","sp":450,"ep":451},{"h":"BARD","t":"Eastern empire; for he was treacherous, cruel, and ambitious.

The colour is bright green; as the plant advances towards maturity, this colour vanishes away till it comes at last to be a dull green tinged with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>.\n\nGazul bears the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> to barilla, both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> and appearance: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> consists in its growing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> a still drier falter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, consequently it is impregnated with a stronger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>. It does not rise above two inches out of the ground, spreading out into little tufts. Its sprigs are much flatter and more pulpy than those of barilla, and are still more like samphire. It is sown but once in three, four, or five years, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>.\n\nSoza, when of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, has the same appearance as gazul; but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> grows much larger, as its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> soil is a strong salt marsh, where it is to be found in large tufts of sprigs, treble the size of barilla, and of a bright green colour, which it retains to the last.\n\nSalicor has a stalk of a deep green colour inclining to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, which last becomes by degrees the colour of the whole plant. From the beginning it grows upright, and much resembles a bush of young rosemary. Its natural soil is on the declivities of hills near the salt marshes, or on the edges of the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DRAINS\">drains</a> or channels cut by the husbandmen for the purpose of watering the fields; before it has acquired its full growth, it is very like the barilla of those seasons in which the ground has been dunged before sowing. In those years of manuring, barilla, contrary to its usual nature, comes up with a tinge of red; and when burnt falls far short of its wonted goodness, being bitter, more impregnated with salts than it should be, and raising a blister if applied for a few minutes to the tongue. Barilla contains less salt than the others: when burnt, it runs into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> resembling a pungent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, with a faint <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> of blue.\n\nGazul, after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>, comes as near barilla in its outward appearance as it does while growing in its vegetable form; but if broken, the inside is of a deeper and more glossy blue. Soza and salicor are darker, and almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> within, of a heavier consistence, with very little or no sign of sponginess.\n\nAll these ashes contain a strong alkali; but barilla the best and purest, though not in the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>. Upon this principle, it is fitted for making glaas and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BLEACHING\">bleaching</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>; the others are used in making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>. Each of them would whiten linen; but all, except barilla, would burn it. A good crop of barilla impoverishes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a> to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, that it cannot bear good barilla a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time, being quite exhausted. For this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> the richer farmers lay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a> upon the ground, and let it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> fallow for a season; at the end of which it is sown afresh without any danger, as the weeds that have sprung up in the year of rest have carried off all the pernicious effects of the dung. A proper succession of crops is thus secured by manuring and fallowing the different parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a>, each in their turn. The poorer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of cultivators cannot pursue the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> for want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>; and are therefore under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of sowing their lands immediately after manuring, which yields them a profit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> sufficient to afford a present scanty subsistence, though the quality and price of their barilla be but trifling.\n\nThe method used in making barilla is the same as that followed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> in burning kelp. The plant as soon as ripe is plucked up and laid in heaps, then set on fire. The salt juices run out below into a hole made in the ground, where they run into a vitrified lump, which is left about a fortnight to cool. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a> may give about a ton.\n\n**BARING OF TREES,** in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a>, the taking away some of the earth about the roots, that the winter-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> and snow-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> may penetrate farther into\ninto the roots.

Buffon, that trees stripped of their bark the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of their stems, die in about three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> four years. But it is very remarkable, that trees thus stripped in the time of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAP\">sap</a>, and suffered to die, afford <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> heavier, more uniformly dense, stronger, and fitter for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, than if the trees had been cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in their healthy state. Something of a like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> has been observed by Vitruvius and Evelyn.\n\nThe ancients wrote their books <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> bark, especially of the ash and lime tree, not on the exterior, but on the inner and finer bark called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILYRA\">philyra</a>.\n\nThere are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> many kinds of barks in use in the several arts. Some in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TANNING\">tanning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAK\">oak</a>-bark; some in physic, as the quinquina or Jesuit's bark, mace, &c.; others in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYEING\">dyeing</a>, as the bark of alder and walnut trees; others in spicery, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CINNAMON\">cinnamon</a>, cassia lignea, &c.; and others for divers uses, as the bark of the cork tree, &c.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">East</a> Indies, they prepare the bark of a certain tree so as to spin like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a>. After it has been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> and steeped in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, they extract <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> threads from it, which are something between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> thread; being neither so soft nor so glossy as silk, nor so rough and hard as hemp. They mix silk with it in some stuffs; and these are called nillae, and cherquemolles.\n\nOf the bark of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of mulberry-tree the Japanese make their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>. See MORUS.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Otaheite, the natives make their cloth, which is of three kinds, of the bark of three different trees; the paper-mulberry above mentioned, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>-fruit tree, and the cocoa tree. That made of the mulberry is the finest and whitest, and worn chiefly by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> people. It is manufactured in the following manner. When the trees are of a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, they are drawn up, and stripped of their branches; after which, the roots and tops are cut off: the bark of these rods being then slit up longitudinally, is easily drawn off; and, when a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> has been procured, it is carried down to some running water, in which it is deposited to soak, and secured from floating away by heavy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>: when it is supposed to be sufficiently softened, the women servants go down to the brook, and, stripping themselves, sit down in the water, to separate the inner bark from the green part on the outside: to do this, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> the under side upon a flat smooth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOARD\">board</a>, and with a kind of shell scrape it very carefully, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIPPING\">dipping</a> it continually in the water till nothing remains but the fine fibres of the inner coat. Being thus prepared in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a>, they are spread out upon plantain leaves in the evening; they are placed in lengths of about 11 or 12 yards, one by the side of another, till they are about a foot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and two or three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a> are also laid one upon the other: care is taken that the cloth shall be in all parts of an equal thickness, so that if the bark happens to be thinner in any one particular part of one layer than the rest, a piece that is somewhat thicker is picked out to be laid over in the next. In this state it remains till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, when great part of the water which it contained when it was laid out is either drained off or evaporated, and the several fibres adhere together, so as that the whole may be raised from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> in one piece. It is then taken away, and laid upon the smooth side of a long piece of wood prepared for the purpose, and beaten by the women servants. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> used for this purpose is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> wooden club, having each of its four sides or faces marked, lengthwise, with small grooves, or furrows, of different degrees of fineness; those on one side being of a width and depth sufficient to receive a small pack-thread, and the others finer in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> gradation, so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> are not more than equal to sewing silk. They beat it first with the coarsest side of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALLET\">mallet</a>, keeping time like our smiths; it spreads very fast under the strokes, chiefly however in the breadth, and the grooves in the mallet mark it with the appearance of threads; it is successively beaten with the other sides, last with the finest, and is then fit for use. Of this cloth there are several sorts, of different degrees of fineness, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> as it is more or less beaten. The other cloth also differs in proportion as it is beaten; but they differ from each other in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the different materials of which they are made. The bark of the bread-fruit is not taken till the trees are considerably longer and thicker than those of the mulberry; the proceeds afterwards is the same.\u2014Of the bark, too, of a tree which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> poeoeo*, they manufacture excellent matting; * Hibiscus both a coarse sort which serves them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> upon, and a finer to wear in wet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>.

Thus, in the 22nd century there <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be fourteen days <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the styles; and therefore the true time of new moon in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> example being reduced to the new style will be the 22nd of July, at 22 minutes 55 seconds past six in the evening.\n\nTo calculate the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of the Sun for any given moment of time.\n\nPrecept I.

Thus, at the time of mean new moon in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 1764, the Sun's mean...\nmean distance from the ascending node is $5^\\circ 35' 2''$. See Example I.\n\nThe descending node is opposite to the ascending one, and they are just six signs distant from each other.\n\nWhen the sun is within 17 degrees of either of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NODES\">nodes</a> at the time of new moon, he will be eclipsed at that time; and when he is within 12 degrees of either of the nodes at the time of full moon, the moon will be then eclipsed. Thus we find, that there will be an eclipse of the sun at the time of new moon in April 1764.\n\nBut the true time of that new moon comes out by the equations to be 50 minutes 46 seconds later than the mean time thereof, by comparing these times in the above example: and therefore we must add the sun's motion from the node during that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> to the above mean distance $5^\\circ 35' 2''$, which motion is found in Table XII. for 50 minutes 46 seconds, to be $2' 12''$. And to this we must apply the equation of the sun's mean distance from the node in Table XV. found by the sun's anomaly, which, at the mean time of new moon in Example I. is $5^\\circ 1^\\circ 26' 10''$; and then we shall have the sun's true distance from the node, at the true time of new moon, as follows:\n\n| Sun from Node. |  |\n|----------------|---|\n| At the mean time of new moon in April 1764 | $5^\\circ 35' 2''$ |\n| Sun's motion from the node for 50 minutes 46 seconds | $2' 12''$ |\n| Sun's mean distance from node at true new moon | $5^\\circ 37' 14''$ |\n| Equation of mean distance from node, add | $2' 50''$ |\n| Sun's true distance from the ascending node | $5^\\circ 42' 14''$ |\n\nWhich being far within the above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> of 17 degrees, shows that the sun must then be eclipsed.\n\nAnd now we shall show how to project this, or any other eclipse, either of the sun or moon.\n\nTo project an Eclipse of the Sun.\n\nIn order to this, we must find the following elements by means of the tables.\n\n1. The true time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> of the sun and moon; and at that time.\n2. The semidiameter of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>'s disk, as seen from the moon, which is equal to the moon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLAX\">parallax</a>.\n3. The sun's distance from the solstitial colure to which he is then nearest.\n4. The sun's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECLINATION\">declination</a>.\n5. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of the moon's visible path with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECLIPTIC\">ecliptic</a>.\n6. The moon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>.\n7. The moon's true horary motion from the sun.\n8. The sun's semidiameter.\n9. The moon's semidiameter of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENUMBRA\">penumbra</a>.\n\nWe shall now proceed to find these elements for the sun's eclipse in April 1764.\n\nTo find the true time of new moon. This, by Example I. is found to be on the first day of the said <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, at 30 minutes 25 seconds after ten in the morning.\n\n2. To find the moon's horizontal parallax, or semidiameter of the earth's disk, as seen from the moon. Enter Table XVII. with the signs and degrees of the moon's\n\nanomaly (making proportions, because the anomaly is of calculating in the table only to every 6th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>), and thereby take out the moon's horizontal parallax; which for the above time, answering to the anomaly $11^\\circ 9' 24' 21''$, is $54' 43''$.\n\n3. To find the sun's distance from the nearest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLSTICE\">solstice</a>, viz. the beginning of Cancer, which is $3^\\circ$ or $90^\\circ$ from the beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARIES\">Aries</a>. It appears by Example I. (where the sun's place is calculated to the above time of new moon), that the sun's longitude from the beginning of Aries is then $5^\\circ 12' 10' 12''$: that is, the sun's place at that time is $9^\\circ$ Aries, $12' 10' 12''$.\n\nTherefore from\n\nSubtract the sun's longitude or place\n\nRemains the sun's distance from the solstice\n\nOr $79^\\circ 49' 48''$; each sign containing 30 degrees.\n\n4. To find the sun's declination. Enter Table XIV. with the signs and degrees of the sun's true place, viz. $5^\\circ 12' 10' 12''$, and making proportions for the $10' 12''$, take out the sun's declination answering to his true place, and it will be found to be $4^\\circ 49'$ <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>.\n\n5. To find the moon's latitude. This depends on her distance from her ascending node, which is the same as the sun's distance from it at the time of new moon; and is thereby found in Table XVI.\n\nBut we have already found that the sun's equated distance from the ascending node, at the time of new moon in April 1764, is $5^\\circ 7' 23' 14''$. See above.\n\nTherefore, enter Table XVI. with 0 signs at the top, and 7 and 8 degrees at the left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and take out $36' 49''$, the latitude for $7^\\circ$; and $41' 51''$, the latitude for $8^\\circ$; and by making proportions between these latitudes for the $4' 14''$, by which the moon's distance from the node exceeds 7 degrees, her true latitude will be found to be $40' 18''$ north ascending.\n\n6. To find the moon's true horary motion from the sun. With the moon's anomaly, viz. $11^\\circ 9' 24' 21''$, Table XVII. and take out the moon's horary motion; which, by making proportions in that Table, will be found to be $30' 22''$. Then, with the sun's anomaly, $9^\\circ 10' 26' 10''$, take out his horary motion $2' 28''$ from the same table; and subtracting the latter from the former, there will remain $27' 54''$ for the moon's true horary motion from the sun.\n\n7. To find the angle of the moon's visible path with the ecliptic. This, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a> of eclipses, may be always rated at $5^\\circ 35'$, without any sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>.\n\n8. To find the semidiameters of the sun and moon. These are found in the same table, and by the same arguments, as their horary motions. In the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the sun's anomaly gives his semidiameter $16' 6''$, and the moon's anomaly gives her semidiameter $14' 57''$.\n\n9. To find the semidiameter of the penumbra. Add the moon's semidiameter to the sun's, and their sum will be the semidiameter of the penumbra, viz. $31' 9''$.\n\nNow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> these elements, that they may be found more readily when they are wanted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of this eclipse.\n1.

If the earth's axis had lain to the left hand from the axis of the ecliptic, the distance VP would have been set off from V towards g.\n\nTo draw the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> of latitude of any given place, as suppose London, or the path of that place on the earth's enlightened disk as seen from the sun, from sunrise till sunset, take the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a>.\n\nSubtract the latitude of London, 51\u00b0 9' from 90\u00b0, and the remainder 38\u00b0 1' will be the colatitude, which take in your compasses from the line of chords, making CA or CB the radius, and set it from b (where the earth's axis meets the periphery of the disk) to VI and VI, and draw the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCULT\">occult</a> or dotted line VI K VI.\n\nThen, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> where this line meets the earth's disk, set off the chord of the sun's declination 4\u00b0 49' to D and F, and to E and G, and connect these points by the two occult lines F XII G and DLE.\n\nBisect LK XII, and through the point K draw the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> line VI K VI. Then making CB the radius of a line of fines on the sector, take the colatitude of London 38\u00b0 1' from the fines in your compasses, and set it both ways from K to VI and VI. These hours will be just in the edge of the disk at the equinoxes, but at no other time in the whole year.\n\nWith the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> K VI taken into your compasses, set one foot in K (in the black line below the occult one) as a centre, and with the other foot describe the semicircle VI 7 8 9 10, &c., and divide it into 12 equal parts. Then from these points of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> draw the occult lines 7a, 8a, 9a, &c., parallel to the earth's axis C XII P.\n\nWith the small extent K XII as a radius, describe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a> arc XII f, and divide it into five equal parts, as XII, a, ab, bc, cd, de, and ef; and through the division points a, b, c, d, e, draw the occult lines VII e V, VIII d IV, IX c III, X b II, and XI, a I, all parallel to VI K VI, and meeting the former occult lines 7a, 8a, &c., in the points VII VIII IX X XI, V IV III II and I; which points shall mark the several situations of London on the earth's disk, at these hours respectively, as seen from the sun; and the elliptic curve VI VII VIII, &c., being drawn through these points, shall represent the parallel of latitude, or path of London on the disk, as seen from the sun, from its rising to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a>.\n\nN. B. If the sun's declination had been south, the diurnal path of London would have been on the upper side of the line VI K VI, and would have touched the line DLE in L. It is requisite to divide the horary spaces into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> (as some are in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>), and, if possible, into minutes also.\n\nMake CB the radius of a line of chords on the sector, and take therefrom the chord of 5\u00b0 35', the angle of the moon's visible path with the ecliptic, set it off from H to M on the left hand of CH, the axis of the ecliptic, because the moon's latitude is north ascending. Then draw CM for the axis of the moon's orbit, and bisect the angle MCH by the right line Cx.\n\nIf the moon's latitude had been north descending, the axis of her orbit would have been on the right hand from the axis of the ecliptic.\u2014N. B. The axis of the moon's orbit lies the same way when her latitude is south ascending as when it is north ascending; and the same way when south descending as when north descending.\n\nTake the moon's latitude 40\u00b0 18' from the scale CA in your compasses, and set it from i to x in the bisecting line Cx, making it parallel to Cy; and through x, at right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> to the axis of the moon's orbit CM, drawn the straight line N wxy S for the path of the penumbra's centre over the earth's disk.\u2014The point w, in the axis of the moon's orbit, is that where the penumbra's centre approaches nearest to the centre of the earth's disk, and consequently in the middle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> eclipses: the point x is that where the conjunction...\nAppendix.","sp":163,"ep":167},{"h":"NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THESE DISCOVERIES BY","t":"g all these discoveries by means of telescopes, it was evident that they still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> state, and their imperfections at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> appeared to be without remedy. One defect was the enormous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> requisite to admit of any very considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNIFYING\">magnifying</a> power; and another was the incorrectness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a> arising from the aberration of the rays, as was then supposed, by the spherical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of the glass. To obviate these inconveniences, Mercenius is said to have first proposed, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Descartes, the use of reflectors instead of lenses in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of telescopes; but this he did in such an obscure manner, that the latter laboured to persuade him of the falsehood of the principle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> which his scheme was founded. In 1663, however, James Gregory of Aberdeen showed how such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a> might be constructed. He showed also, that, in order to form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> image of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> in this manner, the figure of the speculum ought to be parabolic; but Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton, who applied himself to the framing of telescopes of the reflecting kind, found it impracticable to grind them of the desired figure. Laying aside the idea of reflecting telescopes, therefore, he applied himself to the execution of a scheme formed by Descartes, viz. that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> lenses of the figure of one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONIC_SECTIONS\">conic sections</a>. In prosecuting this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, he discovered, that the greatest errors to which telescopes were subject arose from the different refrangibility of the rays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, for which he could not then find any remedy. He therefore returned to the scheme he had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> abandoned; and, in the year 1672, presented to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> two reflectors which were constructed with spherical speculums, as he could not procure any other. The inconveniences arising from the different refrangibility of the rays of light, have since been in the fullest manner corrected by Mr Dollond, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-EXCELLENCY\">excellency</a> of whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACHROMATIC\">achromatic</a> telescopes is too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> known to need any encomium.\n\nAbout the beginning of the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, the practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a> seemed to languish for want of proper instruments. Roemer, indeed, had invented some new ones, and Dr Hooke had turned his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> towards this subject in a very particular manner; but either through want of skill in the arts, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> some other unfortunate circumstance, it happened that nothing effectual was done. But at the very time when this was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with practical astronomy, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> part was carried in a manner to its utmost pitch by the labours of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a> Newton, whose Principia gave an entire new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>. It was not, however, for many years relished by the foreign philosophers, though almost immediately adopted at home, and has continued ever since to spread its reputation farther and farther, so that now it is in a manner established all over the world. \"But (says Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">Long</a>) that, after Newton's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> had for so long a time been neglected, it should all at once be universally received and approved of, is not to be attributed to chance, or the caprice of fashion, as some who are ignorant of it are apt to think, and from thence to expect that some other system <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> hereafter take its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> it in oblivion. The system of Newton, like that of Copernicus, is so agreeable to the phenomena of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and so well put together, that it must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> as long as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> endure, although time may perhaps bring the word <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> into disuse; and though it may no longer be thought inherent in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, yet the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>, as they are now called, and on which this system is founded, will never be forgotten.\"\n\nIt was also in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> that the first improvements in astronomical instruments took place. The celebrated...\nmechanic and watchmaker, Graham, carried the accuracy of his instruments to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> which surprised every one. He also greatly improved the principles of watchwork, and made clocks to go with much greater regularity than before. The old eight feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURAL\">mural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a> was also constructed by him; as was a small equatorial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECTOR\">sector</a> for making observations out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MERIDIAN\">meridian</a>; but he is chiefly remarkable for contriving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZENITH\">zenith</a> sector of 24 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADIUS\">radius</a>, and afterwards one of 12\u00bd feet, by which Dr Bradley discovered the aberration of the fixed stars. The reflecting telescope which had been invented by Gregory, and executed by Newton, was greatly improved by Mr Hadley, and a very complete and powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of that kind was presented to the Royal Society in 1719.\n\nThe same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> has also immortalized his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of the reflecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a>, which he presented to the Society in 1731, which is now in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> use at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>; and without which all improvements of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> would have been useless for determining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>, through the want of an instrument proper to make the observations with. It however appears, that an instrument, exactly similar to this in its principles, had been invented by Sir Isaac Newton, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of it, together with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a>, given by the inventor to Dr Halley, when he was preparing for his voyage to discover the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a> in 1701. About the middle of this century, the constructing and dividing of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> astronomical instruments was carried to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> by Mr John <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIRD\">Bird</a>; reflecting telescopes were equally improved by Mr Short, who first executed the divided object-glass micrometer. This had indeed been thought of by M. Louville, and several other persons long before; and a description of one nearly agreeing with that of Mr Short had been published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1753; but had it not been for the great skill of Mr Short in figuring and centering glasses of this kind, it is very probable the scheme might never have been executed. About this time also Mr Dollond brought refracting telescopes to such perfection, that they became superior to reflectors of equal length; though all of them are now excelled by those of Mr Herschel, whose telescopic discoveries have been far more numerous and surprising than those of any other astronomer.\n\nWe shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> with a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the labours of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> astronomers since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> the royal observatories at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> and Greenwich, and the appointment of Mr Flamsteed to the office of astronomer royal. This gentleman not only made observations on the sun, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, planets, and comets which appeared in his time, but on the fixed stars also, of which he gave a catalogue of 3000; many of them so small that they cannot be discerned without the help of a telescope: he also published new solar tables, and a theory of the moon according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORROX\">Horrox</a>. He published a very curious tract on the doctrine of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a>, in which he showed how to construct eclipses of the sun and moon, as well as occultations of the fixed stars by the moon, geometrically; and it was upon his observations that Halley's tables and Newton's theory of the moon were constructed. Mr Caffini also distinguished himself very considerably. He erected the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GNOMON\">gnomon</a>, and drew the famous meridian line in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Petronia at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>. He enjoyed his office more than 40 years, making many observations on the sun, moon, planets, and comets, and greatly amended the elements of their motions; though the result of his labours was much inferior to Mr Flamsteed's. The office was continued in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and his grandson still enjoys it. Roemer, a celebrated Danish astronomer, first discovered the progressive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of light by observing the eclipses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>, and read a dissertation upon it before the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris in the year 1675. He was also the first who made use of a meridional telescope.\n\nMr Flamsteed was succeeded in 1719 by Dr Halley, \"the greatest astronomer (says M. de la Lande) without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> in England;\" and, adds Dr Long, \"I believe he might have said in the whole world.\" He had been sent, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 21, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">King</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> II. to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of St Helena, in order to make a catalogue of the southern stars, which was published in 1679. In 1705, he published his Synopsis Astronomiae Cometicae, in which, after immense calculation, he ventured to predict the return of one in 1758 or 1759. He also published many learned dissertations in the Philosophical Transactions concerning the use that might be made of the next transit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENUS\">Venus</a> in determining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of the sun from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. He was the first who discovered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a> of the moon, and gave a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of finding her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLAX\">parallax</a> by three observed phases of a solar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECLIPSE\">eclipse</a>. He compiled tables of the sun, moon, and all the planets; and, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> years in which he was at Greenwich, made near 1500 observations of the moon; all which he compared with the tables, and noted the differences; and these, he thought, would return in about 18 years. He recommended the method of determining the longitude by means of the moon's distance from the sun and certain fixed stars. He was convinced of its superior excellence; and has since been adopted by all the most eminent astronomers in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. It is at present the only sure guide to the mariner; and the great perfection to which it is now brought is much owing to the industry and exertions of Dr Maskelyne, the present astronomer-royal, to whom we are indebted for the publication of the Nautical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALMANACK\">Almanack</a>, the Requisite Tables, and other works of the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to practical astronomy.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time an attempt was made in France to True figure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> a degree of the earth, which occasioned a very fine warm dispute concerning the figure of it. Caffini, from Picart's measure, concluded that the earth was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHEROID\">spheroid</a>; but Newton, from a consideration of the laws of gravity and the diurnal motion of the earth, had determined the figure of it to be an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBLATE\">oblate</a> spheroid, and flattened at the poles. To determine this point, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XV. resolved to have two degrees of the meridian measured; one under, or very near the equator; and the other as near the pole as possible. For this purpose the Royal Academy of Sciences sent M. Mauupertuis, Clairault, Camus, and Le Monier, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAPLAND\">Lapland</a>. They were accompanied by the Abb\u00e9 Outhier, a correspondent of the same academy. They were joined by M. Celsius professor of anatomy at Upsal; and having set out from France in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> of the year 1736, returned to it in 1737, after having fully\nfully accomplished their errand. On the southern expedition were despatched M. Godin, Condamine, and Bouguer, to whom the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> joined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DON\">Don</a> George Juan and Don Anthony de Ulloa, two very ingenious gentlemen and officers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a>. They left Europe in 1735; and after enduring innumerable hardships and difficulties in the execution of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>, returned to Europe at different times, and by different ways, in the years 1744, 1745, and 1746.\n\nThe result of this arduous task was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of Newton's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>. Picart's measure was revised by Cassini and De la Caille; and, after his errors were corrected, it was found to agree very well with the other two. On this occasion too it was discovered, that the attraction of the great mountains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a> had an effect on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUMB_LINE\">plumb-line</a> of one of their largest instruments, drawing it seven or eight seconds from the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a>.\n\nDr Halley, dying in 1742, was succeeded by Dr Bradley, who, though inferior as a mathematician, greatly exceeded him as a practical astronomer. He was the first who made observations with an accuracy sufficient to detect the lesser inequalities in the motions of the planets and fixed stars. Thus he discovered the aberration of light, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUTATION\">nutation</a> of the earth's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a>, and was able to make the lunar tables much more perfect than they had ever been. He also observed the places, and computed the elements of the comets which appeared in the years 1723, 1736, 1743, and 1757. He made new and more accurate tables of the motions of Jupiter's satellites, from his own observations and those of Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">Pound</a>; and from a multitude of observations of the sun, moon, and stars, was enabled to give the most accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> of mean refractions yet extant, as well as the best methods of computing the variations of those refractions arising from the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> as indicated by the thermometer and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a>. In 1759, having procured a very large transit instrument made by Mr Bird, and a new mural quadrant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> eight feet radius, he began to make observations with redoubled industry; so that between this time and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, which happened in 1762, he made observations for settling the places of all the stars in the British catalogue, together with near 1500 places of the moon, much the greater part of which he compared with the tables of Mr Mayer.\n\nIn the meantime the French astronomers were afflu- duous in their endeavours to promote the science of astronomy. The theory of the moon, which had been given in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> by Sir Isaac Newton, began to be particularly considered by Messrs Clairault, D'Alembert, Euler, Mayer, Simpson, and Walmly; though Clairault, Euler, and Mayer, distinguished themselves beyond any of the rest, and Mr Euler has been particularly happy in the arrangement of his tables for the ease and expedition of computation. He was excelled in exactness, however, by Mayer, who published his tables in the G\u00f6ttingen Acts for 1753. In these the errors in longitude never exceeded two minutes; and having yet farther improved them, he sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> to the lords of the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRALTY\">admiralty</a> in 1755; and it was this copy which Dr Bradley compared with his observations, as already mentioned. His last corrections of them were afterwards sent over by his widow; for which she and her children received a reward of 3000l.\n\nAccurate tables for Jupiter's satellites were also composed by Mr Wargentin a most excellent Swedish astronomer, and published in the Upsal Acts in 1741; which have since been corrected by the author in such a manner as to render them greatly superior to any ever published before.\n\nAmongst the many French astronomers who contributed to the advancement of the science, we are particularly indebted to M. de la Caille, for a most excellent set of solar tables, in which he has made allowances for the attractions of Jupiter, Venus, and the moon. In 1750 he went to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">Hope</a>, in order to make observations in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> with the most celebrated astronomers in Europe, for determining the parallax of the moon, as well as of the planet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a>, and from thence that of the sun; from whence it appeared that the parallax of the sun could not greatly exceed ten seconds. Here he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-examined and adjusted the places of the southern stars with great accuracy, and measured a degree of the meridian at that place. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> the science was cultivated with the greatest fidelity by Signor Bianchini, Father Bofcovich, Frili, Manfredi, Zanotti, and many others; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a> by Wargentin already mentioned, Blingenforn, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALLET\">Mallet</a>, and Planman; and in Germany, by Euler elder and younger, Mayer, Lambert, Grischow, &c. In the year 1760 all the learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> in Europe began to prepare for observing the transit of Venus over the sun, foretold by Dr Halley upwards of 80 years before it happened, showing, at the same time, the important use which might be made of it. Unfortunately, however, for the cause of science, many of the astronomers sent out to observe this phenomenon were prevented by unavoidable accidents from reaching the places of their destination, and others were disappointed by the badness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. It happened also, that the circumstances of the phenomenon were much less favourable for the purpose of determining the sun's parallax than had been expected by Dr Halley, owing to the faults of the tables he made use of; so that notwithstanding all the labours of astronomers at that time, they were not able to determine the matter; and even after their observations in 1769, when the circumstances of the transit were more favourable, the parallax of the sun remained still uncertain.\n\nDr Bradley was succeeded in his office of astronomer-royal by Mr Bliss Savilian professor of astronomy at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>; who, being in a very declining state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> at the time of his accession to the office, did not enjoy it long. He was succeeded by the learned Nevil Maskelyne, D.D., the present astronomer-royal, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> will be rendered immortal by his fidelity and success in bringing the lunar method of determining the longitude at sea into general practice.\n\nSuch was the general state of astronomy, when Dr Herschel's great discovery of augmenting the power of telescopes, beyond the most sanguine hopes of astronomers, opened at once a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> altogether unlooked for. By this indefatigable observer we are made acquainted with a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> planet attended by six secondaries belonging to our solar system; so that the latter now appears to have double the bounds formerly assigned to it; this new planet being at least twice the distance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a> from the sun. In the still farther distant celestial regions, among the fixed stars, his observations...\nPart II. OF THE <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">APPARENT</a> MOTIONS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES.\n\nWhen we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> our eyes up towards the heavens, we perceive a vast hollow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEMISPHERE\">hemisphere</a> at an unknown distance, of which our eye seems to constitute the centre. The earth stretches at our feet like an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, and at a certain distance appears to meet and to bound the heavenly hemisphere. Now the circle all around, where the earth and the heavens seem to meet and touch each other, is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>. We can scarcely avoid supposing, that besides the hemisphere which we perceive, there is another, exactly similar, concealed from our view by the earth, and that the earth, therefore, is somehow or other suspended in the middle of this heavenly sphere, with all its inhabitants. A little observations turns this suspicion into certainty. For in a clear evening the heavenly hemisphere is seen studded with stars, and its appearance is changing every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a>. New stars are continually rising in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a>, while others in the mean time are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> in the west. Those stars, that, towards the beginning of the evening, were just seen above the eastern horizon, late at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> are seen in the middle of the starry hemisphere, and may be traced moving gradually westward, till at last they sink altogether under the horizon. If we look to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, we soon perceive, that many stars in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> never set at all, but move round and round, describing a complete circle in 24 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>. These stars describe their circles round a fixed point in the heavens; and the circles are the smaller, the nearer the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a> is to the fixed point. This fixed point is called the north pole. There must be a similar fixed point in the southern hemisphere, called the south pole. Thus the heavenly sphere appears to turn round two fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, called the poles, once every 24 hours. The imaginary line which joins the points is called the axis of the world.\n\nIn order to have precise notions of the motions of the heavenly bodies, it is necessary to be able to assign precisely the place in which they are. This is done by means of several imaginary lines, or rather circles, supposed described upon the surface of the sphere; and these circles, as is usual with mathematicians, are divided into 360 equal parts called degrees. Every degree is divided into 60 minutes; every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> into 60 seconds, and so on. That great circle of the sphere, which is perpendicular to the axis of the world, and of course 90\u00b0 distant from either pole, is called the equator. The smaller circles, which the stars describe in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of their diurnal motions, are called parallels, because they are obviously <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the equator.\n\nThe equator divides the heavenly sphere into two equal parts, the north and the south; but to be able to assign the position of the stars, it is necessary to have another circle, passing through the poles, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> the equator perpendicularly. This circle, is called a meridian. It is supposed, not only to pass through the poles, but to pass also through the point directly over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the observer, and the point of the sphere exactly opposite to that. The first of these points is called the zenith, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NADIR\">nadir</a>.\n\nThe meridian divides the circles described by the stars into two equal parts; and when they reach it they are either at their greatest height above the horizon, or they are at their least height. The situation of the pole is easily determined; for it is precisely half way between the greatest and least height of those stars which never set. When we advance towards the north we perceive that the north pole does not remain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>, but rises towards the zenith, nearly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the space we pass over. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> it sinks just as much when we travel towards the south. Hence we learn that the surface of the earth is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>, as one would at first suppose, but curved.\n\nAll the heavenly bodies appear to describe a complete circle round the earth every 24 hours. But besides these motions which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to them all, there are several of them which possess motions peculiar to themselves. The sun, the most brilliant of all the heavenly bodies, is obviously much farther to the south during winter than during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>. He does not, therefore, keep the same station in the heavens, nor describe the same circle every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. The moon not only changes her form, diminishes, and increases; but if we observe the stars, near which she is situated one evening, the next evening we shall find her considerably to the eastward of them; and every day she removes to a still greater distance, till in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, she makes a complete tour of the heavens, and approaches them from the west. There are eight other stars, besides, which are continually changing their place; sometimes we observe them moving to the westward, sometimes to the eastward, and sometimes they appear stationary for a considerable time. These stars are called planets. There are other bodies which appear only occasionally, move for some time with immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CELERITY\">celerity</a>, and afterwards vanish. These bodies are called comets. But the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the heavenly bodies always retain nearly the same relative distance from each other, and are therefore called fixed stars. It will be necessary for us to consider the nature and apparent motions of all these bodies. We shall, therefore, divide this first part of our treatise, into the following heads:\n\n1. Of the Sun.\n2. Of the Moon.\n3. Of the Planets.\n4. Of the Comets.\n5. Of the Fixed Stars.\n6. Of the figure of the Earth.\n\nThese topics shall be the subjects of the following chapters.\nThe sun, as the most conspicuous and most important of all the heavenly bodies, would naturally claim the first place in the attention of astronomers. Accordingly its motions were first studied, and they have had considerable influence on all the other branches of the science. We shall subdivide this part of our subject into three parts. In the first, we shall give an account of the apparent motions of the sun; in the second, we shall treat of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of time, which is regulated by these apparent motions; and in the third, we shall consider the figure and structure of the sun, as far as they have been determined by astronomers. These shall be the subjects of the following sections.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. I. Apparent Motions of the Sun.\n\nThat the sun has a peculiar motion of its own, independent of the diurnal motion common to all the heavenly bodies, and in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> contrary to that motion, is easily ascertained, by observing with care the changes which take place in the starry hemisphere during a complete year. If we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> the time at which any particular star rises, we shall find that it rises somewhat sooner every succeeding day, till at last we lose it altogether in the west. But if we note it after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of a year, we shall find it rising precisely at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> as at first. Those stars which are situated nearly in the track of the sun, and which set soon after him, in a few evenings lose themselves altogether in his rays, and afterwards make their appearance in the east before sunrise. The sun then moves towards them in a direction contrary to his diurnal motion. It was by observations of this kind that the ancients ascertained his orbit. But at present this is done with greater precision, by observing every day the height of the sun when it reaches the meridian, and the interval of time which elapses between his passing the meridian and that of the stars. The first of these observations gives us the sun's daily motion northward or southward, in the direction of the meridian; and the second gives us his motion eastward in the direction of the parallels; and by combining the two together, we obviously obtain his orbit: But it will be necessary to be somewhat more particular.\n\nThese observations cannot be made without drawing a meridian line, or a line, which, if produced, would pass through both the poles of the earth, and the spot where the observer is placed. It is obvious, that such a line is in the same plane with the meridian as the the heavenly hemisphere. A meridian line may be found thus: On an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> plane describe three or four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCENTRIC\">concentric</a> circles, as E, G, H, fig. 1. Plate LIX. and in the common centre fix perpendicularly a wire CB, having a well-defined point. When the sun shines in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, observe where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> of the top of the wire, as CD, touches one of the circles; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a> mark where the extremity of the shadow CF just touches the same circle: then through the centre C draw the line CE, bisecting the arc DF, and CE will be a meridian, as required. If the same be done with as many of the circles as the shining of the sun will admit of, and the mean of all the bisecting lines CE be chosen as a meridian, there will be no doubt of its accuracy, particularly if the observations be made about midsummer, which is the best time. After a meridian line is thus found, another parallel to it may be readily drawn at any convenient distance: the method is this: Hang a thread and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUMMET\">plummet</a> exactly over the fourth end of the known meridian line, and let another thread and plummet be hung over the fourth end of the plane upon which a meridian is to be drawn; then let a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> observe when the shadow of the thread falls on the given meridian, and immediately give a signal to another person, who must at that moment mark two points on the shadow of the second thread, through which two points the new meridian must be described.\n\nThe height of the sun from the horizon, when it passes the meridian, or the arch of the meridian between the sun and the horizon, is called the sun's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a>. The ancients ascertained the sun's altitude in the following manner: They erected an upright pillar at the fourth end of a meridian line, and when the shadow of it exactly coincided with that line, they accurately measured the shadow's length, and then, knowing the height of the pillar, they found, by an easy operation in plane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">trigonometry</a>, the altitude of the sun's upper limb: whence, after allowing for the apparent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SEMI\">semi</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, the altitude of the sun's centre was known. But the methods now adopted are much more accurate. In a known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>, a large astronomical quadrant, of six, eight, or ten feet radius, is fixed truly upon the meridian; the limb of this quadrant is divided into minutes, and smaller subdivisions, by means of a vernier; and it is furnished with a telescope (having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> hairs, &c. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> properly upon the centre). By this instrument the altitude of the sun's centre is very carefully measured, and the proper deductions made.\n\nWith a similar instrument we may ascertain the apparent motions of the sun in the following manner, beginning our observations about the 20th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>. On this day we must note some fixed star which comes to the meridian exactly at the same time as the sun does; for the stars may be seen in the daytime with an astronomical telescope. On the following day, both the altitude of the sun, and the situation of the stars when the sun is on the meridian, must be observed; the sun's meridian altitude will be about $23^\\circ 40'$ greater than on the former day, and the star will be found on the meridian about $3$ m. $39$ sec. in time before the sun. Make similar observations for a few days, and it will be found at the end of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, that the sun's meridian altitude will be increased $2^\\circ 46'$, and the star will be on the meridian $25$ m. $26$ sec. in time before the sun, or it will be $6^\\circ 21\\frac{1}{2}$ westward of the meridian when the sun is upon it. During this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of seven days, therefore, the sun has been moving towards the east, and has increased his altitude by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> gradations. In fig. 2. let EQ represent a portion of the equator, QS the meridian on which the sun is, QS his altitude above the equator, E the place of the star, and ES part of the path of the sun: then, in the spherical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> EQS, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>-angled at O, there are given $EQ = 6^\\circ 21\\frac{1}{2}$, and $QS = 2^\\circ 46'$, to find the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> E. By the rules of spherical trigonometry, we have, $\\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TAN\">tan</a> \\text{tang. of } E = \\frac{\\tan \\text{tang. of } SQ}{\\sin \\text{fine of } QE} = \\frac{0.48325}{0.1167463} = 4.364479$.\nApparent Motions of the Heavenly Bodies.\n\nThe orbit in which the sun moves is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECLIPTIC\">ecliptic</a>. It does not coincide with the equator, but cuts it, forming with it an angle, which in the year 1769 was determined by Dr. Maskelyne, at $23^\\circ 28' 10''$, or $23^\\circ 46' 944$. This angle is called the obliquity of the ecliptic.\n\nThe different seasons of the year are occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of this proper motion of the sun with his diurnal motion. The two points in which the ecliptic cuts the equator, are called the equinoxes, or equinoctial points; because on the days that the sun is in them, he describes by his diurnal motion the equator, which being divided into two equal parts by the horizon, the day is then equal to the night in every part of the earth. One of these equinoxes is called the vernal, because the sun is in it about the 20th of March, or the beginning of the spring. As the sun advances in his orbit from that point, his meridian altitude becomes greater and greater every day. The visible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> of the parallels which it describes, become continually greater; and with them the length of the day increases, till the sun reaches his greatest altitude, or distance from the equator: then the day is the longest of the year. And as at that period the variations in the sun's altitude are scarcely sensible for some time, as far at least as it affects the length of the day; the point of the orbit, where the sun's altitude is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAXIMUM\">maximum</a>, has for that reason been called the summer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLSTICE\">solstice</a>. The parallel which the sun describes when in that point, is called the tropic of Cancer. From the solstice the sun descends again towards the equator, crosses it again at the autumnal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUINOX\">equinox</a>, and goes southward till its altitude becomes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINIMUM\">minimum</a>. This point of the orbit is called the winter solstice. The day is then the shortest of the year, and the parallel which the sun describes, is called the tropic of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPRICORN\">Capricorn</a>. From the winter solstice the sun again approaches the equator, and returns to the vernal equinox.\n\nSuch is the constant course of the sun and of the seasons. The interval between the vernal equinox and the summer solstice, is called the spring; the interval between this solstice and the autumnal equinox, is called summer; that between the autumnal equinox and the winter solstice, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a>; and that between this solstice and the vernal equinox, is winter.\n\nThe different altitudes of the pole in different climates, occasion remarkable peculiarities in the seasons, with which it is proper to be acquainted. At the equator the poles are situated in the horizon, which last circle cuts all the parallels into two equal parts. Hence the day and the night are constantly of the same length all the year round. On the equinoxes the sun is in the zenith at noon. His altitude is the least possible at the solstices, and is then equal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEMENT\">complement</a> of the inclination of the ecliptic. During the summer solstice, the shadows of bodies illuminated by the sun are directed towards the south; but they are directed towards the north at the winter solstice; changes which never take place in our northern climates. Under the equator there are in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> two summers and two winters. The same thing takes place in all countries lying between the tropics. Beyond them there is only one summer and one winter in the year. The sun is never in the zenith. The apparent length of the longest day increases, and that of the shortest day diminishes, as we advance toward the poles; and when the distance between the zenith and the pole is only equal to the inclination of the ecliptic, the sun does not set at all on the days of the summer solstice, nor rise on that of the winter solstice. Still nearer the pole, the period in which he never sets in summer, and never rises in winter, gradually increases from a few days to several months; and, under the pole itself, the equator then coinciding with the horizon, the sun never sets when it is upon the same side of the equator with the pole, and never rises while it is in the opposite side.\n\nThe intervals of time between the equinoxes and solstices are not equal. There are about seven days more uniform between the vernal and autumnal equinox than between the autumnal and vernal. Hence we learn, that the motion of the sun in its orbit is not uniform. Numerous observations, made with precision, have ascertained, that the sun moves fastest in a point of his orbit situated near the winter solstice, and slowest in the opposite point of his orbit near the summer solstice. When in the first point, the sun moves in 24 hours $1^h 0^m 19^s 43$; in the second point, he moves only $0^h 05^m 31^s$. The daily motion of the sun is constantly varying in every place of its orbit, between these two points. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of the two is $0^h 08^m 62^s$, or $59' 11''$, which is the daily motion of the sun about the beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a>. It has been ascertained, that the variation in the angular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> of the sun, is very nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the mean angular distance of it from the point of its orbit, where its velocity is greatest.\n\nIt is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to think, that the distance of the sun from the earth varies as well as its angular velocity. This is demonstrated by measuring the apparent diameter of the sun. Its diameter increases and diminishes in the same manner, and at the same time, with its angular velocity; but in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> twice as small. About the beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a>, his apparent diameter is about $32' 39''$, and at the beginning of July it is about $31' 34''$, or more exactly, according to De la Place, $32' 35'' = 195''$ in the first case, and $31' 18'' = 1878''$ in the second.\n\nOpticians have demonstrated, that the distance of any body is always reciprocally as its apparent diameter. The sun must follow the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>; therefore, its distance from the earth increases in the same proportion that its apparent diameter diminishes. That point of the orbit in which the sun is nearest the earth, is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIGEE\">perigee</a>, or perigee; and the point of the orbit in which that luminary is farthest distant from the earth, is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOGEE\">apogee</a>. When the sun is in the first of these points, his apparent diameter is greatest, and his motion swiftest; but when he is in the other point, both his diameter and the rapidity of his motion are the smallest possible.\n\nFrom these remarks it is obvious that if the orbit of the sun be a circle, the earth is not situated in the centre of that circle, otherwise the distance of the sun from the earth would remain always the same, which is contrary to fact. It is possible therefore, that the variation in his angular velocity may not be real, but only apparent. Thus in fig. 3, let AMPN be the orbit\nIt is obvious that P is the sun's perigee, and A its apogee. Now as the sun's apparent orbit is a circle having the earth in its centre, it is evident that this orbit must be AMPN, and that the angular motion of the sun will be measured upon that circle. Suppose now that the sun in his apogee moves from A to A', it is obvious that his apparent or angular motion will be the segment \\(a'a'\\) of the apparent orbit, considerably smaller than AA', so that at the apogee the angular motion of the sun will be less than his real motion.\n\nAgain: let the sun in his perigee move from P to P', describing a segment precisely equal to the segment AA'. This segment as seen from the earth will be referred to \\(p'p\\), which in that case will be the sun's angular motion, evidently considerably greater than his real motion.\n\nHence it is obvious that even on the supposition that the sun moved equably in his orbit, his angular motion as seen from the earth would still vary, that is, would be smallest at the apogee, and greatest at the perigee; and that the angular and real motion would only coincide at the points M and N, where the real and apparent orbits cut each other. From the figure it is obvious also, that the angular velocity would increase gradually from the apogee to the perigee, and diminish gradually from the perigee to the apogee, which likewise corresponds with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>. Now the line EC, which is the distance of the earth from the centre of the sun's orbit, is called the eccentricity of that orbit. The variation in the angular motion of the sun may be owing to this eccentricity.\n\nBut if it were owing to this cause alone, it is easy to demonstrate that in that case the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of his angular velocity would follow the same ratio as the diminution of his diameter. The fact however is, that the angular velocity diminishes in a ratio twice as great as the diameter of the sun does. The variation of the angular velocity cannot then be owing to the eccentricity alone. Hence it follows, that the variation of the motion of the sun is not merely apparent, but real; and that its velocity in its orbit actually diminishes, as his distance from the earth increases. Two causes then combine to produce the variation in the sun's angular velocity; namely, 1. The increase and diminution of his distance from the earth; and 2. The real increase and diminution of his velocity in proportion to this variation of distance. These two causes combine in such a manner that the daily angular motion of the sun diminishes as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of his distance increases, so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> of the angular velocity multiplied into the square of the distance is a constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>. But this law is so important that it will be necessary to be more particular.\n\nThe observation that the sun's angular motion in his orbit is inversely proportional to the square of his distance from the earth, was first made by Kepler. The discovery was made by a careful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the sun's diurnal motion with his apparent diameter, which were found to follow that law; and it is evident that the one is the angular motion of the sun, and the other his distance from the earth, which is inversely proportional to his apparent diameter. Let ASB (fig. 4.) be the sun's orbit, E the earth, and S the sun. Suppose a line ES joining the centres of the earth and sun to move round along with the sun. This line is called the radius vector. It is obvious that when S moves to S', ES, moving along with it, is now in the situation ES', having described the small sector ESS'. In the same time that S performs one revolution in its orbit, the radius vector ES will describe the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AREA\">area</a> ABS, enclosed within the sun's orbit. Let SS' be the sun's angular motion during one day. It is obvious that the small sector ESS' is proportional to the square of ES, multiplied by SS': for the radius vector is the sun's distance from the earth, and SS' his angular motion. Hence this sector is a constant quantity, whatever the angular motion of the sun be; and the whole area SEA increases as the number of days which the sun areas proportions in moving from S to A. Hence results that remarkable law, first pointed out by Kepler, that the areas described by the radius vector are proportional to the times.\n\nSuppose the sun to describe SS' in one day, and SA in 20 days, then the area SES' is to the area SEA as 1 to 20; or the area SEA is 20 times greater than the area SES'.\n\nThe knowledge of these facts enables us to draw upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, from day to day, lines proportional to the length of the radius vector of the solar orbit, and having the same relative position as these lines. If we join the extremities of these lines, by making a curve pass through them, we shall perceive that this curve is not exactly circular. Let E in fig. 5. represent the earth, and Ea, Eb, Ec, Ed, Ef, &c. the position and length of the radius vector during every day of the year: if we join together the points a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, k, l, m, n, o, by drawing the curve aeiom through them, it is obvious that this curve is not a circle, but elongated towards a and i, the points which represent the sun's greatest and least distance from the earth. The resemblance of this curve to the ellipse induced Kepler to compare them together, and he ascertained their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDENTITY\">identity</a>. Hence it follows, that the orbit of the sun is an ellipse, having the earth in one of its foci. The centre C of the ellipse is the point where its greater axis is cut perpendicularly by its smaller axis. The distance CE, between the earth and that centre, is the eccentricity of the sun's orbit. The eccentricity of this orbit is not great. Let the earth's mean distance from the sun be represented by 10,000; it has been ascertained that the eccentricity is equal to 168 of these parts. Hence the sun's orbit does not differ much from a circle.\n\nTo form a precise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of the elliptical motion of the sun, let us suppose a point to move uniformly in the circumference of a circle, whose centre coincides with the centre of the earth, and whose radius is equal to the sun's distance from the earth when in his perigee. Let us suppose also, that the sun and the point set out together from the perigee, and that the motion of the point is equal to the sun's mean angular motion. While the radius vector of the point moves uniformly round the earth, the radius vector of the sun moves with unequal velocity, describing always areas proportional to the times. At first it gets before the radius vector of the point, and forms with it an angle, which after having increased till it reached a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a>, diminishes again and becomes equal to zero, when the sun is in apogee; then the radius vector of the sun and of the point\npoint coincide both with each other, and with the greater axis of the ellipse. After passing the apogee of the radius vector of the point gets before that of the sun, and forms with it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> exactly equal to the angles formed by the same lines in the former half of the ellipse, at the same distance from the perigee. At the perigee, the radius vector of the sun and of the point again coincide with each other, and with the greater axis of the ellipse. The angle which the radius vector of the sun makes with that of the point, which indicates how much the one precedes the other, is called the equation of the centre. It is always greatest when the motions of the point and of the sun are equal, and it vanishes altogether when there is the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between these motions. The angular motion of the point is called the mean motion, and that of the sun the real motion. The place of the point in the orbit is called the mean place. Now, if to the mean place in the orbit, we add or subtract the equation of the centre, it is obvious that we have the sun's real place for any given time. The angular motion of the point is known with precision for a given time, a day for instance, by ascertaining the exact length of time which the sun takes in making a complete revolution round its orbit. For if we ascertain how many days that revolution requires, we have only to divide the whole orbit by that number to prove the portion of it traversed by the point in one day. The equation of the centre can only be found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a>. Its maximum in the year 1750 was 1\u00b09.268.\n\nIn computations we begin always at that part of the orbit where the motion of the sun is slowest. The distance of the imaginary point from that part, is called the mean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANOMALY\">anomaly</a>. A table is made of the equation of the centre, corresponding to each degree of the mean anomaly. By adding or subtracting these equations from the mean anomaly, we obtain the true anomaly or place of the sun for any given time.\n\nThe ecliptic is usually divided, by astronomers, into 12 equal parts, called signs, each of which of course contains 30 degrees. They are usually called the signs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZODIAC\">zodiac</a>; and beginning at the equinox, where the sun intersects and rises above the equator, have these names and marks, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARIES\">Aries</a> \u2648, Taurus \u2649, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEMINI\">Gemini</a> \u264a, Cancer \u264b, Leo \u264c, Virgo \u264d, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LIBRA\">Libra</a> \u264e, Scorpio \u264f, Sagittarius \u2650, Capricornus \u2651, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AQUARIUS\">Aquarius</a> \u2652, Pisces \u2653. Of these signs, the first six are called northern, lying on the north side of the equator; the last six are called southern, being situated to the south of the equator. The signs from Capricornus to Gemini are called ascending, the sun <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> or rising to the north pole while it passes through them; and the signs from Cancer to Sagittarius are called descending, the sun, as it moves through them, receding or descending from the north pole.\n\nThe longitude of the sun is his distance in the ecliptic from the first point of Aries. His right ascension is the arc of the equator intercepted between the first point of Aries, and the meridian circle, which passes through his longitude. The distance of the sun from the equator, measured upon a meridian circle, is called his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECLINATION\">declination</a>, and it is either north or south according to the situation of the sun.\n\nIt has been observed that the position of the larger axis of the elliptical orbit of the sun, is not constant.\n\nThe angular distance of the perigee from the vernal equinox, counted according the sun's movement, was 27\u00b08'6.21\" at the beginning of 1750; but it has, relative to the stars, an annual motion of about 11\".89 in the same direction as the sun.\n\nThe orbit of the sun is gradually approaching to the equator. Its obliquity diminishes in a century at the rate of about 1\u00b050'.\n\nThe precision of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> astronomers has enabled them to ascertain small irregularities in the sun's elliptical motion, which observation alone would scarcely have been able to bring under precise laws. These irregularities will be considered afterwards.\n\nTo determine the distance of the sun from the earth, distance of the sun has always been an interesting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> to astronomers, and they have tried every method which astronomy or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a> possesses in order to resolve it. The simplest and most natural, is that which mathematicians employ to measure distant terrestrial objects. From the two extremities of a base whose length is known, the angles which the visual rays from the object, whose distance is to be measured, make with the base, are measured by means of a quadrant; their sum subtracted from 180\u00b0, gives the angle which these rays form at the object where they intersect. This angle is called the parallax, and when it is once known, it is easy, by means of trigonometry, to ascertain the distance of the object.\n\nLet AB, in fig. 6, be the given base, and C the object whose distance we wish to ascertain. The angles CAB and CBA, formed by the rays CA and CB with the base, may be ascertained by observation; and their sum subtracted from 180\u00b0 leaves the angle ACB, which is the parallax of the object C. It gives us the apparent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of the base AB as seen from C.\n\nWhen this method is applied to the sun, it is necessary to have the largest possible base. Let us suppose two observers on the same meridian, observing at the same instant the meridian altitude of the centre of the sun, and his distance from the same pole. The difference of the two distances observed, will be the angle under which the line which separates the observers will be seen from the centre of the sun. The position of the observers gives this line in parts of the earth's radius. Hence, it is easy to determine, by observation, the angle at which the semidiameter of the earth would be seen from the centre of the sun. This angle is the sun's parallax. But it is too small to be determined with precision by that method. We can only conclude from it, that the sun's distance from the earth is at least equal to 10,000 diameters of the earth. We shall find afterwards, that other methods have been discovered for finding the parallax with much greater precision. It amounts very nearly to 8\".8; hence it follows, that the distance of the sun from the earth amounts to 23,405 semi-diameters of the earth.\n\nSect. II. Of the Division of Time.\n\nMotion is peculiarly adapted for measuring time. For, as a body cannot be in different places in the same time, it can only arrive from one part to another, by passing successively through all the intermediate spaces. And if it be possible to ascertain, that in every point of the line which it describes it is actuated by the very same force, we can conclude with confidence, that it will\nApparent will describe the line with a uniform motion. Of course the different parts of the line will be a measure of the time employed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> them. When a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a> at the end of every oscillation is precisely in the same circumstances, the length of the oscillations is the same, and time may be measured by their number. We might employ also, for the same purpose, the revolutions of the heavenly sphere, which appear perfectly uniform. But all nations have agreed to employ the revolutions of the sun for that purpose.\n\nIn common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, the day is the interval of time which elapses from the rising to the setting of the sun; the night is the interval that the sun continues below the horizon. The astronomical day embraces the whole interval which passes during a complete revolution of the sun. It is the interval of time which passes from 12 o'clock at noon, till the next succeeding noon. It begins when the sun's centre is on the meridian of that place. It is divided into 24 hours, reckoning in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMERICAL\">numerical</a> succession from 1 to 24; the first 12 are sometimes distinguished by the mark P.M., signifying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a> meridiem, or after noon; and the latter 12 are marked A.M., signifying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANTE\">ante</a> meridiem, or before noon. But astronomers generally reckon through the 24 hours, from noon to noon; and what are by the civil or common way of reckoning called morning hours, are by astronomers reckoned in the succession from 12, or midnight, to 24 hours. Thus 9 o'clock in the morning of February 14th, is, by astronomers, called February the 15th at 21 hours.\n\nAn astronomical day is somewhat greater than a complete revolution of the heavens, which forms a sidereal day. For if the sun crosses the meridian at the same instant with a star, the day following it will come to the meridian somewhat later than the star, in consequence of its motion eastward, which causes it to leave the star; and after a whole year has elapsed, it will have crossed the meridian just one time less than the star. A sidereal day is less than the solar day, for it is measured by $360^\\circ$, whereas the mean solar day is measured by $360^\\circ + 59' 8''$ nearly. If an astronomical day be $=1$, then a sidereal day is $=0.997259723$; or the difference between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of a mean solar day, and a sidereal day, viz. $59' 8''$, reduced to time, at the rate of 24 hours to $360^\\circ$, gives $3' 56''$; from which we learn that a star which was on the meridian with the sun on one noon, will return to that meridian $3' 56''$ previous to the next noon: therefore, a clock which measures mean days by 24 hours, will give $23 h. 56 m.$ 4 sec. for the length of a sidereal day.\n\nAstronomical or solar days, as they are also called, are not equal. Two causes conspire to produce their inequality, namely, the unequal velocity of the sun in his orbit, and the obliquity of the ecliptic. The effect of the first cause is sensible. At the summer solstice, when the sun's motion is slowest, the astronomical day approaches nearer the sidereal, than at the winter solstice when his motion is most rapid.\n\nTo conceive the effect of the second cause, it is necessary to recollect that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of the astronomical day above the sidereal is owing to the motion of the sun, referred to the equator. The sun describes every day a small arch of the ecliptic. Through the extremities of this arch suppose two meridian great circles drawn, the arc of the equator, which they intercept, is the sun's motion for that day referred to the equator; apparent and the time which that arc takes to pass the meridian is equal to the excess of the astronomical day above the sidereal. But it is obvious, that at the equinoxes, the arc of the equator is smaller than the corresponding arc of the ecliptic in the proportion of the cosine of the obliquity of the ecliptic to radius: at the solstices, on the contrary, it is greater in the proportion of radius to the cosine of the same obliquity. The astronomical day is diminished in the first case, and lengthened in the second.\n\nTo have a mean astronomical day, independent of these causes of inequality, astronomers have supposed a second sun to move uniformly on the ecliptic, and to pass over the extremities of the axis of the sun's orbit, at the same instant with the real sun. This removes the inequality arising from the inequality of the nominal sun's motion. To remove the inequality arising from the obliquity of the ecliptic, astronomers suppose a third sun passing through the equinoxes at the same instant with the second sun, and moving along the equator in such a manner that the angular distances of the two suns at the vernal equinox shall be always equal. The interval between two consecutive returns of this third sun to the meridian forms the mean astronomical day. Mean time is measured by the number of the returns of this third sun to the meridian; and true time is measured by the returns of the real sun to the meridian. The arc of the equator, intercepted between two meridian circles drawn through the centres of the true sun, and the imaginary third sun, reduced to time, is what is called the equation of time. This will be rendered plainer by the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DIAGRAM\">diagram</a>.\n\nLet $Z\\varphi x \\Delta$ (fig. 7.) be the earth; $ZFRx$, its axis; $abcde$, &c. the equator; $ABCDE$, &c. the northern half of the ecliptic from $\\varphi$ to $\\Delta$, on the side of the globe next the eye; and $MNOP$, &c. the southern half on the opposite side from $W$ to $\\varphi$. Let the points at $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, $F$, &c. quite round from $\\varphi$ to $\\varphi$ again bound equal portions of the ecliptic, gone through in equal times by the real sun; and those at $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$, $f$, &c., equal portions of the equator described in equal times by the fictitious sun; and let $Z\\varphi x$ be the meridian.\n\nAs the real sun moves obliquely in the ecliptic, and the fictitious sun directly in the equator, with respect to the meridian; a degree, or any number of degrees, between $\\varphi$ and $F$ on the ecliptic, must be nearer the meridian $Z\\varphi x$, than a degree, or any corresponding number of degrees, on the equator from $\\varphi$ to $f$; and the more so, as they are the more oblique: and therefore the true sun comes sooner to the meridian every day whilst he is in the quadrant $\\varphi F$, than the fictitious sun does in the quadrant $\\varphi f$; for which reason, the solar noon precedes noon by the clock, until the real sun comes to $F$, and the fictitious to $f$; which two points, being equidistant from the meridian, both suns will come to it precisely at noon by the clock.\n\nWhilst the real sun describes the second quadrant of the ecliptic $FGHIKL$ from Cancer to $\\Delta$, he comes later to the meridian every day than the fictitious sun moving through the second quadrant of the equator from $f$ to $\\Delta$; for the points at $G$, $H$, $I$, $K$, and $L$, being farther from the meridian, their corresponding points at $g$, $h$, $i$, and $l$, must be later of coming to it:\nApparent and as both suns come at the same moment to the meridian of noon by the clock.\n\nIn departing from Libra, through the third quadrant, the real sun going through MNOPOQ towards r at R, and the fictitious sun through mnpq towards r, the former comes to the meridian every day sooner than the latter, until the real sun comes to O, and the fictitious to r, and then they come both to the meridian at the same time.\n\nLastly, As the real sun moves equably through STUVW, from O towards r; and the fictitious sun through stuvw, from r towards r', the former comes later every day to the meridian than the latter, until they both arrive at the point r', and then they make it noon at the same time with the clock.\n\nHaving explained one cause of the difference of time shown by a well-regulated clock and a true sun-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DIAL\">dial</a>, supposing the sun, not the earth, as moving in the ecliptic; we now proceed to explain the other cause of this difference, namely, the inequality of the sun's apparent motion; which is slowest in summer, when the sun is farthest from the earth, and swiftest in winter when he is nearest to it.\n\nIf the sun's motion were equable in the ecliptic, the whole difference between the equal time as shown by the clock, and the unequal time as shown by the sun, would arise from the obliquity of the ecliptic. But the sun's motion sometimes exceeds a degree in 24 hours, though generally it is less; and when his motion is slowest, any particular meridian will revolve sooner to him than when his motion is quickest; for it will overtake him in less time when he advances a less space than when he moves through a larger.\n\nNow, if there were two suns moving in the plane of the ecliptic, so as to go round it in a year; the one describing an equal arc every 24 hours, and the other describing sometimes a less arc in 24 hours, and at other times a larger, gaining at one time of the year what it lost at the opposite; it is evident, that either of these suns would come sooner or later to the meridian than the other, as it happened to be behind or before the other; and when they were both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a>, they would come to the meridian at the same moment.\n\nAs the real sun moves unequally in the ecliptic, let us suppose a fictitious sun to move equably in a circle coincident with the plane of the ecliptic. Let ABCD (fig. 8.) be the ecliptic or orbit in which the real sun moves, and the dotted circle abcd the imaginary orbit of the fictitious sun; each going round in a year according to the order of letters, or from west to east. Let HIKL be the earth turning round its axis the same way every 24 hours; and suppose both suns to start from A and a, in a right line with the plane of the meridian EH, at the same moment: the real sun at A, being then at his greatest distance from the earth, at which time his motion is slowest; and the fictitious sun at a, whose motion is always equable, because his distance from the earth is supposed to be always the same. In the time that the meridian revolves from H to H again, according to the order of the letters HIKL, the real sun has moved from A to F; and the fictitious with a quicker motion from a to f, through a large arc; therefore, the meridian EH will revolve sooner from H to b under the real sun at F, than from HE to k under the fictitious sun at f; and consequently it will then be noon by the sun-dial sooner than by the clock.\n\nAs the real sun moves from A towards C, the swiftness of his motion increases all the way to C, where it is at the quickest. But notwithstanding this, the fictitious sun gains so much upon the real, soon after his departing from A, that the increasing velocity of the real sun does not bring him up with the equally-moving fictitious sun till the former comes to C, and the latter to c, when each has gone half round its respective orbit; and then being in conjunction, the meridian EH, revolving to EK, comes to both suns at the same time, and therefore it is noon by them both at the same moment.\n\nBut the increased velocity of the real sun now being at the quickest, carries him before the fictitious one; and therefore, the same meridian will come to the fictitious sun sooner than to the real; for whilst the fictitious sun moves from a to g, the real sun moves through a greater arc from C to G; consequently the point K has its noon by the clock when it comes to k, but not its noon by the sun till it comes to l. And although the velocity of the real sun diminishes all the way from C to A, and the fictitious sun by an equable motion is still coming nearer to the real sun, yet they are not in conjunction till the one comes to A and the other to a, and then it is noon by them both at the same moment.\n\nTrue time is obtained by adding or subtracting this equation to the mean time. The mean and apparent solar days are never equal, except when the sun's daily motion in right ascension is 59\u00b0 8' 5\"; this is nearly the case about April 15th, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 15th, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> 15th, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 24th: on these days the equation is nothing, or nearly so; it is at the greatest about November 11th, when it is 16 m. 14 sec.\n\nThe return of the sun to the same equinox marks the year, in the same way as his return to the same meridian indicates the days. It has been ascertained, that before the sun returns again to the same equinox, an interval of 365.242222 days elapses, or 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 47 seconds. This is called the tropical year: The sun takes a larger interval of time to return again to the same star. The sidereal year is the interval which the sun employs to return from one star to another. It is greater than the tropical year by 0.014162 days, or 20 m. 23 sec.; therefore the length of the sidereal year is 365 days, 6 h. 9 m. and 10 sec.\n\nFrom this it follows, that the equinoxes do not retain the same place in the ecliptic, but that they have a retrograde motion, or contrary to that of the sun, in consequence of which they describe every year an arc equal to the mean space which the sun passes over in 20\u00b0 23\", or about 50\"; so that they would make a complete revolution in 25972 years. This is called the precession of the equinoxes.\n\nDr Maskelyne has invented a rule for computing the equation of time, in which the precession of the computing equinoxes, as well as the two causes mentioned above, the equation of ALQ, the equator, A the first point of Aries, P the point where the sun's apparent motion is slowest, S any place of the sun; draw Sw perpendicular to the equator,\nApparent equator, and take \\( \\Lambda n = AP \\). When the sun begins to move from \\( P \\), suppose a star to begin to move from \\( n \\) with the sun's mean motion in right ascension or longitude, viz., at the rate of \\( 59^\\circ 8'' \\) in a day; and when \\( n \\) passes the meridian let the clock be adjusted to 12. Take \\( n = PR \\), and when the star comes to \\( m \\), if the sun moved uniformly with his mean motion, he would be found at \\( s \\); but at that time let \\( S \\) be the place of the sun. Let the sun \\( S \\), and consequently \\( v \\), be on the meridian; and then as \\( m \\) is the place of the imaginary star at that instant, \\( mv \\) must be the equation of time. The sun's mean place is at \\( r \\), and as \\( \\Lambda n = AP \\), and \\( n = PS \\), we have \\( A m = APs \\), consequently \\( mv = Av - Am = Av - APs \\). Let \\( a \\) be the mean equinox, or the point where it would have been if it had moved with its mean velocity, and draw \\( z \\) perpendicular to \\( AQ \\); then \\( Am = Az + zm = \\Lambda a \\times \\text{co-sine} \\times \\Lambda a + zm \\): or because the co-sine of \\( \\Lambda a \\) the obliquity of the ecliptic, \\( 23^\\circ 28' \\), is \\( \\frac{11}{12} \\) very nearly, \\( Am = \\frac{11}{12} \\Lambda a + zm \\): hence \\( mv = Av - zm - \\frac{11}{12} \\Lambda a \\). Here \\( Av \\) is the sun's true right ascension, \\( zm \\) the mean right ascension or mean longitude; and \\( \\frac{11}{12} \\Lambda a \\) (viz., \\( \\Lambda x \\)) is the equation of the equinoxes in right ascension; therefore the equation of time is equal to the difference of the sun's true right ascension and his mean longitude, corrected by the equation of the equinoxes in right ascension.\u2014When \\( Am \\) is less than \\( Av \\), mean or true time precedes apparent; when it is greater, apparent time precedes mean. That is, when the sun's true right ascension is greater than his mean longitude corrected as above shewn, we must add the equation of time to the apparent to obtain the mean time; and when it is less, we must subtract. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> mean time into apparent, we must subtract in the former case, and add in the latter.\n\nTables of the equation of time are computed by this rule, for the use of astronomers: they are either calculated for the noon of each day, as given in the Nautical and some other almanacks; or for every degree of the sun's place in the ecliptic. But a table of this kind will not answer accurately for many years, on account of the precession and other causes, which render a frequent revision of the calculations necessary.\n\nThe smaller divisions of time were anciently measured by the phases of the moon. It is well known that the moon changes once every 29 or 30 days, and that the interval from one new moon to another is called a lunation, or in common language, a month. There are about twelve lunations in a year. Hence the year was divided into twelve months. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> times people were placed upon eminences on purpose to watch the first appearance of the new moon when their month began. It was customary for these persons to proclaim the first appearance of the moon. Hence the first day of every month was called Calendae; from which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> the word <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALENDAR\">calendar</a> is derived. Almost all nations have divided the year into twelve months, because the seasons nearly return in that period. But they soon perceived that twelve lunar months were far from making a complete year or revolution of the sun. They were anxious, however, to be able to divide the solar year into a precise number of lunar months, because many of their feasts depended upon particular new moons. Various contrivances were fallen upon for this purpose without much success, till at last Meton, a Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, announced that 19 years contained exactly 235 lunations: an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFIRMATION\">affirmation</a> which is within 2\u00bd hours of being exact. To make every year correspond as nearly as possible to the lunar, he divided the year into 12 months, consisting alternately of 30 and 29 days each; at the end of every three years an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERCALARY\">intercalary</a> month of 30 days was added, and at the end of the 19th year there was added an intercalary month of 29 days. So that at the end of 19 years the solar and lunar years began again on the same day their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CYCLE\">cycle</a> of 19 years. This discovery of Meton appeared so admirable to the Greeks, that they engraved it in letters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> in their public places. Hence the number which denotes the current year of that cycle is denominated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> number.\n\nAs the moon changes its appearance in a very remarkable degree every seven days, almost all nations have subdivided the month into periods of seven days, called weeks; the ancient Greeks were almost the only people who did not employ that division.\n\nThe Roman year in the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-ROMULUS\">Romulus</a> consisted of 10 months only, of 30 or 31 days each, so that its year length was 304 days only. Numa added 50 days to that year, and thus made it 354 days; and he added two additional months of 29 and 28 days, by shortening some of the ancient months. He made the year commence on the first of January. Numa's year was still more than 11 days shorter than a complete revolution of the sun. To make it correspond with the seasons, it was necessary to intercalate three days; and these intercalations being left entirely to the priests, were converted into a state engine; being omitted, inserted, altered, and varied, as it suited the purposes of those magistrates whose views they favoured. The consequence was, what might have been expected, the most complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> and want of correspondence between the year and the seasons.\n\nJulius C\u00e6sar undertook to remedy this inconvenience. He was both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DICTATOR\">dictator</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> pontiff, and of course by Julius C\u00e6sar, the reformation of the calendar was his peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>. That the undertaking might be properly executed, he invited Sofigenes, an Egyptian mathematician, to come to his assistance. It was agreed upon to abandon the motions of the moon altogether, and to make the year correspond with those of the sun.\n\nThe reformation was made in the year 47 before the Christian era. Ninety days were added to that year, which was from that circumstance called the year of confusion, consisting of 445 days. Instead of 354 days, the year of Numa, Sofigenes made the year to consist of 365 days, distributing the additional days among those months which had only 29 days. As the revolution of the sun employs nearly six hours more than 365 days, an additional day was intercalated every fourth year, so that every such year was to consist of 366 days. The additional day was inserted after the 23rd of February, or the 7th before the calends of March; the day before the annual feast celebrated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMEMORATION\">commemoration</a> of the flight of Tarquin from Rome. That feast was held the 6th before the calends of March.\nThe intercalated day was also called the 6th before the calends of March. So that every fourth year there were two days denominated the 6th before the calends of March. Hence that year was called bissextile. In Britain it is denominated leap year. After the death of Julius C\u00e6sar there was a degree of confusion respecting the intercalations, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the priests. Augustus corrected the mistake, and after that time the Julian period went on without any interruption.\n\nIt is obvious that the Julian year, though a great improvement upon the ancient Roman, was still imperfect. It went on the supposition that the revolution of the sun occupied precisely 365 days and 6 hours, which is about 11 minutes more than the truth. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in the interval which elapsed between the reformation of Julius C\u00e6sar and the year 1582, had accumulated till it amounted to 10 days; of course the year began 10 days later than it ought to have begun; and the same error had taken place respecting the seasons and the equinoctial points. Various attempts had been made to correct this error; at last it was corrected by Pope Gregory XIII. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GREGORIAN_CALENDAR\">Gregorian calendar</a> commenced in the year 1582; the changes which he introduced were two in number. He ordered, that after the 4th of October 1582, ten days should be omitted, so that the day which succeeded the 4th was reckoned not the 5th but the 15th of the month. This corrected the error which had crept into the Julian year. To prevent any such error from accumulating again, he ordered that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> years 1700, 1800, 1900, should not be bissextile but common years; that the secular year 2000 should be bissextile, the next three secular years common, the fourth again bissextile, and so on, as in the following table.\n\n| Year | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| 1600 | bissextile   |\n| 1700 | common      |\n| 1800 | common      |\n| 1900 | common      |\n| 2000 | bissextile   |\n\nIn short these secular years only are bissextile whose number, omitting the cyphers, is divisible by 4.\n\nThe Gregorian calendar is sufficiently exact for the purposes of common life, though it does not correspond precisely with the revolution of the sun. The error will amount to a day in 3600 years, so that in the year 5200 it will be necessary to omit the additional day which ought to be added according to the rule laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> above.\n\nThe Gregorian calendar was immediately adopted by all the Roman Catholic kingdoms in Europe, but the Protestant states refused at first to accede to it. It was adopted by most of them on the continent about the beginning of the 18th century; but in England the change did not take place till 1752. From that year 11 days were omitted; the omission of the additional day in 1700 having made the difference between the Julian and Gregorian calendar amount to 11 days. The Julian calendar is called the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, the Gregorian, the new style. At present the difference between them is 12 days, in consequence of the omission of the additional day in 1800.\n\nSect. III. Of the Nature of the Sun.\n\nThe smallness of the sun's parallax is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> of its immense size. We are certain that at the distance at which the sun appears to us under an angle of $0^\\circ 53' 42''$ the earth would be seen under an angle not exceeding $0^\\circ 000$. Now, as the sun is obviously a spherical body as well as the earth; and as spheres are to each other as the cubes of their diameters, it follows from this, that the sun is at least 200,000 times bigger than the earth. By the exactest observations it has been ascertained, that the diameter of the sun is nearly 883,000 miles.\n\nDark spots are very frequently observed upon the surface of the sun. These were entirely unknown before the invention of telescopes, though they are sometimes of sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> to be discerned by the naked eye, only looking through a smoked glass to prevent the brightness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> from destroying the sight. The spots are said to have been first discovered Solar spots in the year 1611; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the discovery when first disputed between Galileo and Scheiner, a German Jesuit at Ingolstadt. But whatever merit Scheiner might have in the priority of the discovery, it is certain that Galileo far exceeded him in accuracy, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of Scheiner has considerable merit, as containing observations selected from above 3000, made by himself. Since his time the subject has been carefully studied by all the astronomers in Europe.\n\nThere is great variety in the magnitudes of the Dr Long's solar spots; the difference is chiefly in superficial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of length and breadth; their depth or thickness is very small; some have been so large, as by computation to be capable of covering the continents of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>; nay, the whole surface of the earth, or even five times its surface. The diameter of a spot, when near the middle of the disk, is measured by comparing the time it takes in passing over a cross <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> in a telescope, with the time wherein the whole disk of the sun passes over the same hair; it may also be measured by the micrometer; and by either of these methods we may judge how many times the diameter of the spot is contained in the diameter of the sun. Spots are subject to increase and diminution of magnitude, and seldom continue long in the same state. They are of various shapes; most of them having a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUCLEUS\">nucleus</a> surrounded by a dusky cloud, whereof the inner parts near the black are a little brighter than the outskirts. They change their shapes, something in the manner that our clouds do; though not often so suddenly: thus, what is of a certain figure to-day, shall to-morrow, or perhaps in a few hours, be of a different one; what is now but one spot, shall in a little time be broken into two or three; and sometimes two or three spots shall coalesce, and be united into one. Dr Long, many years since, while he was viewing the image of the sun through a telescope cast upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> paper, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> one roundish spot, by estimation not much less than the diameter of our earth, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> into two, which receded from one another with prodigious velocity. This observation was singular at the time; for though several writers had taken notice of this after it was done, none of them had been making any observation at the time it was actually doing.\nThe number of spots on the sun is very uncertain; sometimes there are a great many, sometimes very few; and sometimes none at all. Scheiner made observations on the sun from 1611 to 1629; and says he never found his disk quite free of spots, excepting a few days in December 1624. At other times he frequently saw 20, 30, and in the year 1625 he was able to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> 50 spots on the sun at a time. In an interval afterwards of 20 years, from 1650 to 1670, scarce any spots were to be seen, and since that time some years have furnished a great number of spots, and others none at all; but since the beginning of the last century, not a year passed wherein none were not seen; and at present, says Mr. Caffini, in his \u00c9l\u00e9ments d'Astronomie published in 1740, they are so frequent, that the sun is seldom without spots, and often shows a good number of them at a time.\n\nFrom these phenomena, it is evident, that the spots are not endowed with any permanency; nor are they at all regular in their shape, magnitude, number, or in the time of their appearance or continuance. Hevelius observed one that arose and vanished in 16 or 17 hours; nor has any been observed to continue longer than 70 days, which was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of one in the year 1676. Those spots that are formed gradually, are gradually dissolved; while those that arise suddenly, are for the most part suddenly dissolved. When a spot disappears, that part where it was generally becomes brighter than the rest of the sun, and continues for several days; on the other hand, those bright parts (called faculae, as the others are called maculae) sometimes turn into spots.\n\nThe solar spots appear to have a motion which carries them across the sun's disk. Every spot, if it continues long enough without being dissolved, appears to enter the sun's disk on the east side, to go from thence with the velocity continually increasing till it has gone half its way; and then to move slower and slower, till it goes off at the west side; after which it disappears for about the same space of time that it spent in crossing the disk, and then enters upon the east side again, nearly in the same place, and crosses it in the same tract, and with the same unequal motion as before. This apparent inequality in the motion of the spots is purely optical, and is in such proportion as demonstrates them to be carried round equably or in a circle, the plane of which continued passes through or near the eye of a spectator upon the earth.\n\nBesides the real changes of the spots already mentioned, there is another which is purely optical, and is owing to their being seen on a globe differently turned towards us. If we imagine the globe of the sun to have a number of circles drawn upon its surface, all passing through the poles, and cutting his equator at equal distances, these circles which we may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> meridians, if they were visible, would appear to us at unequal distances, as in fig. 2. Now, suppose a spot were round, and so large as to reach from one meridian to another, it would appear round only at g, when it was in the middle of that half of the globe which is towards our earth; for then we view the full extent of it in length and breadth: in every other place it turns away from us, and appears narrower, though of the same length, the farther it is from the middle; and on its coming on at a, and going off at n, it appears as small as a thread, the thin edge being then all that we see.\n\nThese spots have made us acquainted with a very important phenomenon, namely the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> of the sun upon its axis. Amidst the changes which these spots are continually undergoing, regular motions may be detected, agreeing exactly with the motion of the surface of the sun, on the supposition that this luminary revolves round an axis almost perpendicular to the ecliptic in the same direction with its motion in its orbit round the earth. By a careful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the motion of these spots, it has been ascertained that the sun turns round its axis in about 25 days and a half, and that its equator is inclined to the ecliptic about 7\u00b0 5'.\n\nThe spots on the sun's disk are almost always confined to a zone, extending about 30\u00b0 5' on each side of the equator. Sometimes, however, they have been observed at the distance of 39\u00b0 5' from the equator of the sun.\n\nBouguer demonstrated, by a number of curious experiments on the sun's light, that the intensity of the light is much greater toward the centre of the sun's disk than towards its circumference. Now, when a portion of the sun's surface is transported by the rotation of that luminary from the centre to the circumference of his disk, as it is seen under a smaller angle, the intensity of its light, instead of diminishing, ought to increase. Hence it follows, that part of the light which issues from the sun towards the circumference of his disk, must be somehow or other prevented from making its way to the earth. This cannot be accounted for, without supposing that the sun is surrounded by a dense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, which, being traversed obliquely by the rays from the circumference, intercepts more of them than of those from the centre which pass it perpendicularly.\n\nThe phenomena of the solar spots, as delivered by Account of Scheiner and Hevelius, may be summed up in the following particulars. 1. Every spot which hath a different nucleus, or considerably dark part, hath also an umbra, observers. 2. The boundary betwixt the nucleus and umbra is always distinct and well defined. 3. The increase of a spot is gradual, the breadth of the nucleus and umbra dilating at the same time. 4. In like manner, the decrease of a spot is gradual, the breadth of the nucleus and umbra contracting at the same time. 5. The exterior boundary of the umbra never consists of sharp angles; but is always curvilinear, how <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> soever the outline of the nucleus may be. 6. The nucleus of a spot, whilst on the decrease, often changes its figure by the umbra encroaching irregularly upon it, insomuch that in a small space of time new encroachments are discernible, whereby the boundary betwixt the nucleus and umbra is perpetually varying. 7. It often happens, by these encroachments, that the nucleus of a spot is divided into two or more nuclei. 8. The nuclei of the spots vanish sooner than the umbra. 9. Small umbrae are often seen without nuclei. 10. An umbra of any considerable size is seldom seen without a nucleus in the middle of it. 11. When a spot which consisted of a nucleus and umbra is about to disappear, if it is not succeeded.\nceeded by a facula, or spot brighter than the rest of the disk, the place where it was soon after not distinguishable from the rest.\n\nIn the Philosophical Transactions, vol. lxiv. Dr Wilson, professor of astronomy at Glasgow, hath given a dissertation on the nature of the solar spots, and mentions the following appearances. 1. When the spot is about to disappear on the western edge of the sun's limb, the eastern part of the umbra first contracts, then vanishes, the nucleus and western part of the umbra remaining; then the nucleus gradually contracts and vanishes, while the western part of the umbra remains. At last this disappears also; and if the spot remains long enough to become again visible, the eastern part of the umbra first becomes visible, then the nucleus; and when the spot approaches the middle of the disk, the nucleus appears environed by the umbra on all sides, as already mentioned. 2. When two spots <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> very near to one another, the umbra is deficient on that side which lies next to the other spot; and this will be the case, though a large spot should be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to one much smaller; the umbra of the large spot will be totally wanting on that side next the small one. If there are little spots on each side of the large one, the umbra does not totally vanish; but appears flattened or pressed in towards the nucleus on each side. When the little spots disappear, the umbra of the large one extends itself as usual. This circumstance, he observes, may sometimes prevent the disappearance of the umbra in the manner above mentioned; so that the western umbra may disappear before the nucleus, if a small spot happens to break out on that side.\n\nIn the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, p. 337. Mr Wollaston observes, that the appearances mentioned by Dr Wilson are not constant. He positively affirms, that the faculae or bright spots on the sun are often converted into dark ones. \"I have many times (says he) observed, near the eastern limb, a bright facula just come on, which has the next day shown itself as a spot, though I do not recollect to have seen such a facula near the western one after a spot's disappearance. Yet, I believe, both these circumstances have been observed by others; and perhaps not only near the limbs. The circumstance of the facula being converted into spots, I think I may be sure of. That there is generally (perhaps always) a mottled appearance over the face of the sun, when carefully attended to, I think I may be as certain. It is most visible towards the limbs, but I have undoubtedly seen it in the centre; yet I do not recollect to have observed this appearance, or indeed any spots, towards the poles. Once I saw, with a twelve-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> reflector, a spot burst to pieces while I was looking at it. I could not expect such an event, and therefore cannot be certain of the exact particulars; but the appearance, as it struck me at the time, was like that of a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> when dashed on a frozen pond, which breaks to pieces and slides in various directions.\" He also acquaints us, that the nuclei of the spots are not always in the middle of the umbra; and gives the figure of one seen in November 13th 1773, which is a remarkable instance to the contrary. Mr Dunn, however, in his new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATLAS\">Atlas</a> of the Mundane System, gives some particulars very different from the above. \"The face of the sun (says he) has frequently many large black spots, of various forms and dimensions, which move from east to west, and round the sun, according to some observations in 25 days, according to others in 26, and according to some in 27 days. The black or central part of each spot is in the middle of a great number of very small ones, which permit the light to pass between them. The small spots are scarce ever in contact with the central ones; but, what is most remarkable, when the whole spot is near the limb of the sun, the surrounding small ones form nearly a straight line, and the central part projects a little over it, like Saturn in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a>.\"\n\nDr Herschel, with a view of ascertaining more accurately the nature of the sun, made frequent observations upon it from the year 1779 to the year 1794. He imagines that the dark spots on the sun are mountains on its surface, which, considering the great attraction exerted by the sun upon bodies placed at its surface, and the slow revolution it has upon its axis, he thinks may be more than 300 miles high, and yet stand very firmly. He says, that in August, 1792, he examined the sun with several powers from 90 to 500; and it evidently appeared that the dark spots are the opaque <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> or body of the sun; and that the luminous part is an atmosphere, which, being intercepted or broken, gives us a view of the sun itself. Hence he concludes, that the sun has a very extensive atmosphere, which consists of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> fluids that are more or less lucid and transparent; and of which the lucid ones furnish us with light. This atmosphere, he thinks, is not less than 1843, nor more than 2765 miles in height; and, he supposes, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a> of the luminous solar clouds need not be much more than that of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AURORA_BOREALIS\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA\">aurora</a> borealis, in order to produce the effects with which we are acquainted. The sun then, if this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> be admitted, is similar to the other globes of the solar system, with regard to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a>\u2014its atmosphere\u2014its surface diversified with mountains and valleys\u2014its rotation on its axis\u2014and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of heavy bodies on its surface; it therefore appears to be a very eminent, large, and lucid planet, the primary one in our system, diffusing its light and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> to all the bodies with which it is connected.\n\nDr Herschel has lately given up the use of the old terms such as spots, nuclei, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENUMBRA\">penumbra</a>, &c. and has introduced a number of new terms, which he considers as more precise. It will be necessary, before we proceed farther, to infer his explanation of these terms.\n\n\"The expressions,\" says he, \"which I have used are Expansions, openings, shallow, ridges, nodules, corrugations, indentation of his tations, and pores.\n\n\"Openings are those places where, by the accidental removal of the luminous clouds of the sun, its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> body may be seen; and this not being lucid, the openings through which we see it may, by a common telescope, be mistaken for mere black spots, or their nuclei.\n\n\"Shallow are extensive and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> depressions of the luminous solar clouds, generally surrounding the openings to a considerable distance. As they are less luminous than the rest of the sun, they seem to have some distant, though very imperfect resemblance to penumbra; which might occasion their having been called so formerly.\n\n\"Ridges are bright elevations of luminous matter, extended in rows of an irregular arrangement.\n\n\"Nodules are also bright elevations of luminous matter,\"\nCorrugations, I call that very particular and remarkable unevenness, ruggedness, or asperity, which is peculiar to the luminous solar clouds, and extends all over the surface of the globe of the sun. As the depressed parts of the corrugations are less luminous than the elevated ones, the disk of the sun has an appearance which may be called mottled.\n\nIndentations are the depressed or low parts of the corrugations; they also extend over the whole surface of the luminous solar clouds.\n\nPores are very small holes or openings, about the middle of the indentations.\n\nFrom the numerous observations of this philosopher he has drawn the following conclusions:\n\n1. Openings are places where the luminous clouds of the sun are removed: large openings have generally shallows about them; but small openings are generally without shallows. They have generally ridges and nodules about them, and they have a tendency to run into each other. New openings often break out near other openings. Hence he supposes that the openings are occasioned by an elastic but not luminous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAS\">gas</a>, which comes up through the pores and incipient openings, and spreads itself on the luminous clouds, forcing them out of its way, and widening its passage. Openings sometimes differ in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>; they divide when decayed; sometimes they increase again; but when divided they usually decrease and vanish; sometimes they become large indentations, and sometimes they turn into pores.\n\n2. Shallows are depressed below the general surface of the sun, and are places from which the luminous solar clouds of the upper regions are removed. Their thickness is visible; sometimes they exist without openings in them. Incipient shallows come from the openings, or branch out from shallows already formed, and go forward. He supposes that the shallows are occasioned by something coming out of the openings, which, by its propelling motion, drives away the luminous clouds from the place where it meets with the least resistance; or which, by its nature, diffuses them as it comes up to them. If it be an elastic gas, its levity must be such as to make it ascend through the inferior region of the solar clouds, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a> itself among the superior luminous matter.\n\n3. Ridges are elevations above the general surface of the luminous clouds of the sun. One of them, which he measured, extended over an angular space of $2'45''9$, which is nearly $75,000$ miles.\n\nRidges generally accompany openings: but they often also exist in places where there are no openings. They usually disperse very soon. He supposes, that the openings permit a transparent elastic fluid to come out, which disturbs the luminous matter on the top, so as to occasion ridges and nodules; or, more precisely, that some elastic gas, acting below the luminous clouds, lifts them up, or increases them; and at last forces itself a passage through them, by throwing them aside.\n\n4. Nodules are small, but highly elevated luminous places. He thinks that they may be ridges fore-shortened.\n\n5. Corrugations consist of elevations and depressions. They extend all over the surface of the sun; they change their shape and situation; they increase, diminish, divide, and vanish quickly. Dispersed ridges and nodules form corrugations.\n\n6. The dark places of corrugations are indentations. Pores, indentations are usually without openings, though in some places they contain small ones. They change to openings, and are of the same nature as shallows. They are low places, which often contain very small openings. They are of different sizes, and are extended all over the sun. With low magnifying powers they appear like points. The low places of indentations are pores. Pores increase sometimes, and become openings; they vanish quickly.\n\n\"It must be sufficiently evident,\" says Dr Herschel, \"from what we have shown of the nature of openings, shallows, ridges, nodules, corrugations, indentations, and pores, that these phenomena could not appear, if the shining matter of the sun were a liquid; since, by the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HYDROSTATICS\">hydrostatics</a>, the openings, shallows, indentations, and pores, would instantly be filled up; nor could ridges and nodules preserve their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> for a single moment. Whereas, many openings have been known to last for a whole revolution of the sun; and extensive elevations have remained supported for several days. Much less can it be an elastic fluid of an atmospheric nature: this would be still more ready to fill up the low places, and to expand itself to a level at the top. It remains, therefore, only for us to admit this shining matter to exist in the manner of empyreal, luminous, or phosphoric clouds, residing in the higher regions of the solar atmosphere.\"\n\nFrom his observations, Dr Herschel concludes, that there are two different regions of solar clouds; that the gaseous inferior clouds are opaque, and probably not unlike far clouds, those of our planet; while the superior are luminous, and emit a vast quantity of light: that the opaque inferior clouds probably suffer but little of the light of the self-luminous superior clouds to come to the body of the sun. \"The shallows about large openings,\" he observes, \"are generally of such a size, as hardly to permit any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> illumination from the superior clouds to pass over them into the openings; and the great height and closeness of the sides of small ones, though not often guarded by shallows, must also have nearly the same effect. By this it appears, that the planetary clouds are indeed a most effectual curtain, to keep the brightness of the superior regions from the body of the sun.\n\nAnother advantage arising from the planetary clouds of the sun, is of no less importance to the whole solar system. Corrugations are everywhere dispersed over the sun; and their indentations may be called shallows in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINIATURE\">miniature</a>. From this we may conclude, that the immense curtain of the planetary solar clouds is everywhere closely drawn; and, as our photometrical experiments have proved that these clouds reflect no less than 469 rays out of 1000, it is evident that they must add a most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> support to the splendour of the sun, by throwing back so great a share of the brightness.","sp":23,"ep":37},{"h":"RAMIER","t":"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of a plant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>.
